       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | London to Izmir via Istanbul. First time Iâ€™d flown TK. I found them very good in the air, cabin crew, planes, food, all very nice. Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff donâ€™t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasnâ€™t an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, Iâ€™d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: \"Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It\\'s okay\". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it\\'s an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay. If you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Flew on Turkish Airlines IAD-IST-KHI and return KHI-IST-IAD. Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice. Overall another wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines.',\n",

Then after boarding around midnight, and after starting taxiing, the pilot announced that the issue is still there and we have to go back to the gate! Another delay announced! Furthermore, they did not allow the passengers to get off the plane! complete chaos since the passengers do not want to take this aircraft anymore (and I completely understand) and what worsen the situation is that neither the pilot nor any official came to us and explained what is going on. No explanation, no apology, nothing! they requested the police and we saw armed civilian men at the gate . We did not take off until 6:30 am (that's a total delay of more than 9 hours!)

Turkish Airlines have been unhelpful. In my case, even presenting evidence to both airlines, neither is able to find my lost claim luggage.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Belgrade to Athens via Istanbul. My first flight departed with delay from Belgrade due to local weather conditions in Istanbul. I requested for a connection assistance in order to catch my second flight but the airline did not provide me such assistance. I managed to arrive at the gate of departure of my second flight while boarding was not completed and while the screen mentioned 'last call' but I was denied boarding because 'the system had unchecked me from the second flight due to late arrival of my previous plane'. People were boarding in front of my eyes on the plane. The Turkish Airlines officer deceivingly told me to go to another gate (215) because another plane was waiting for me. He just got rid of me. Gate 215 was near the rebooking office of Turkish Airlines for the issuance of new tickets. Although I was condemned to stay overnight at the airport, I was not proposed hotel accommodation or a meal. I was put on another flight departing next morning without even offered the possibility to select my checked seat (the officer rejected my request for an aisle position despite the fact that the plane was half-empty!). I filled a complaint form for denial of boarding and they replied that they are not responsible for a flight delay due to weather conditions. Turkish Airlines maybe is a large company but it manages these type of routine problems poorly as a low budget airline.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Tel Aviv via Ä°stanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but thatâ€™s fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in Ä°stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see whatâ€™s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think itâ€™s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that thereâ€™s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didnâ€™t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because itâ€™s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they canâ€™t get it. And she said you know itâ€™s your fault that it went to Eilat. When I asked her name she refused to give and hanged up on me.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Kiev via Istanbul. Fares seem competitive, but there is a catch in terms of layover time. Mine from Houston to Kiev Via Istanbul had a return leg layover of 14 hours and though TK website says that a layover of over a certain hours gets a complimentary hotel stay. But there is a fine print somewhere which they always get a disqualified citing some wired â€œrulesâ€\\x9d that I, even as a frequent traveler cannot comprehend. Another notable difference in Turkey is that there are endless and multiple security checks, and one wonders if one is going through a war zone . Lines at security checks and passport control ( yes, if you need to stay at a hotel for a long layover, one needs to get an e-VISA just to get out, check into a hotel and get back to airport to catch the connecting flight). Ended up paying way more than if I had chosen other airlines like LH or SAS, which I will keep in mind next time',\n",

I had a connecting flight at 12:20pm on 16th April to Cappadocia from Istanbul but as I reached late due to delay from this airline I missed my flight. They gave me a flight for 11:30 pm without providing any hotel accommodations. Later I had to force them to give me a earlier flight as I was tired so they gave me a flight for 8:35pm TK 2018 which also was delayed and the flight departed at 10:50pm. I some how was happy that at least I reached Cappadocia but my whole day and hotel booking was wasted. I went to pick my luggage but as to my surprise my luggage did not arrive and I was told itâ€™s arriving in the next flight and they shall have it sent to my hotel. I came to my hotel and not itâ€™s about 4pm on 17th April and my luggage has still not arrived even after making several calls. This airline has charged me a lot without giving any good service or facility. I would highly recommend not to book Turkish Airlines ever to any one unless they want to waste their time and money. Donâ€™t know when will my luggage arrive and till when I have to sit in my hotel and waste time as I cannot freshen up unless I get my clothes and got out to see this city.',\n",

I have ask the flight attendants onboard regarding my connecting flight. She assure me that I have no problem doing the connection. Upon arrival, there was no staff to assist. My flight was not showing on the display. I end up going to their care point counter. The staff there is the worst. I would give the rating negative 1. They just took their time to figure out your next flight. If I have not insisted that I need to fly on the same day, they just put me on the next day flight. This is the worst terminal service I come across in my 10 years of travel.',\n",

Just before leaving on our trip they cancelled the second leg of our return flight and placed us on another flight which involved a 14 hour layover in Istanbul airport. Then, upon arrival in Istanbul on our way out to Tel Aviv they cancelled the second leg of this part of the trip as we stood at the gate waiting for departure and put us on another flight several hours later because the later flight was not full. Imagine 300 People at an airline gate waiting as staff filled out new boarding passes for everyone by hand!. We cancelled our return arrangements (without refund) and flew another airline home at the end of our vacation. Rather lose the money then deal with this airline any further!',\n",

I had a very long layover both the ways around (20hrs) each. I had heard from many friends that Turkish would give a hotel or other relevant services if we have to wait there above specific hours. That's why I went directly to the airport help desk/transit passenger resting place to make an inquiry about the service I would get. To my surprise, the lady on the desk took my all information from passport and ticket and said you cannot get a hotel. Then I asked why\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Mumbai to Istanbul. One of the worst experiences of our life has been this trip on Turkish Airlines. After booking a confirmed flight on 6th April we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves 2 days earlier than we land. Thankfully we didn't select this by mistake. Then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at Istanbul. We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it. To make matters worse today the check in doesn't work and they've told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats. Avoid this airline for its terrible customer service.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization. Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight. Other airlines offer very similar prices and the cons don't make up for the flight conditions you will experience.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn\\'t leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: \"Wait a minute\".. I didn\\'t want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.\"The flight is full!\". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the \"great\" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule. The service was the mess and the behaviour of the employees was everything but not professional.',\n",

I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TK's employee and the chef are employed by DO & CO catering company who provided meals for TK's passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given. It will be hard to choose TK for future travel.\",\n",

At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€\\x9d The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Dhaka to Copenhagen via Istanbul. This trip was full of disappointments. Already the airport lounge, Dhaka, demanded money for a glass of wine, unheard. I am a frequent flyer, I have never experienced business class lounge charging a business class passenger, for a glass of wine. Next, on board, no welcome drinks. I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac. Another female crew rushed and snatched the glass, poured half of the content to another glass and then served the guest. We had a laugh- that was entertaining.- but not convincing for making Turkish Airline the choice any more.',\n",

The flight was full but I managed to find space for my carry on bags. The flight left a bit late. The cabin on board was in good condition and seem to be new. The crew and the service was good. The inflight entertaiment is excellent with a big screen for each sea and a great selection of different type of movies. The meal was tasty and there was a good selection of any type of drinks. The flight went fine but it took more time to land in Ataturk airport because of weather in Istanbul.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Manila via Istanbul. This flight was both a disaster and a nightmare. This incident happened during Istanbul-Manila leg of my flight. Im not sure what happened, but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible, flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year, I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice, and went to sleep. Before landing, the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food. I still appreciate his effort to come up with vegan food.',\n",

I was traveling for a conference and unfortunately missed a connection flight after last minute gate change. I was sent around their customer desks without any help. I was finally told I needed to pay extra to change my ticket, an amount that was far more than the original cost of the return ticket. They said the best they could do was to help me call my family. I was left stranded at Istanbul Airport. I had to request a friend to pay for a ticket from a different airline to get to my conference destination. After the conference I went back to the airport hoping to utilize my return ticket with Turkish Airlines, only to be told that it is no invalid and I have to book a flight afresh.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | I along with my 6.5-month-old son were traveling from London to Kabul via Istanbul. The flight from London got delayed. When I arrived at Istanbul I couldn't find my son's pushchair which was supposed to be next to the aircraft. I had to jump on the bus to get to the next flight but when I arrived that was gone. I was only booked on the next flight leaving 24 hours later. I was not offered any accommodation or any facilities to help me care for my baby. Even the pushchair was not brought to me so at least the little one could sleep. In the past when I had traveled with them with my husband for much shorter stays we would be offered free food and drinks but didn't receive that as well. Because I was a woman with a small child and couldn't argue with them because my son was crying all the time, they just made sure I don't get any help, while I should have been offered more given the circumstances. In light of all this, my son and I suffered very much and it wasn't even our fault. Please avoid this airline they are the worst people to fly with. They pick on people who are more vulnerable and in need. I will never ever fly with this airline again. My problem is not with the delays, delays are part of traveling but when the airline gets it wrong they should have the moral standards to look after their customers especially when its a mother and a child. They should have the mindset as to how to do more, but as I explained above their attitude was how to give less and cheat a mother and a little child.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Dalaman to Brussels. Turkish Airlines customer service is outrageous, they do not care about their customers. They called me in the evening to tell me that my morning flight was cancelled and to call a number and rearrange a flight. When I called them 2 different employees ensured me the flight was planned. After arguing for an hour, I gave up. An hour later I received a message saying my flight was cancelled. Spend a total of 3 hours on the phone as they could not get me to my meeting in time. I had to recall them at night to confirm my flight. Had no sleep whatsoever! As I had no guarantee my flight was confirmed. Had to travel 400 km to a different airport. And now Iâ€™m told that itâ€™s not their staff's fault. Well it is Turkish Airlines fault. You Cancel a flight and do not inform your own staff. Instead of an apology I receive a â€˜standardâ€™ mail saying they are not to blame. Shame on you!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I was supposed to fly from Dubai to Atltanta via Istanbul - all on Turkish airlines. The flight from Dubai was delayed by an hour before it even took off. I asked the gentleman at the counter whether this will affect the transit and he said i have got enough time. I landed in Istanbul at 1:50 PM and my next flight was supposed to be at 2:50 PM and had 1 hour to board. Despite getting off the plane and rushing through the security gate, i reached 10 minutes before the boarding and the staff were so rude to say that you have missed your flight - not even a slightest of empathy in any ones behaviour. I was offered another flight via Toronto after 26 hours. They were not ready to issue any visa to enter the country. Also they told that i need to collect my baggage from lost and found and made me wait there for hours before they could track my luggage. One of the worst crew i have come across across. I will never recommend Turkish Airlines to anyone primarily because of the rude behaviour of staff - no exception at all.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me. They have refused to reimburse us with the cost of the hotel & car rental and are fobbing me off regarding the clothing cost. I know that I am legally entitled to this so I will continue to press.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasnâ€™t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasnâ€™t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, Iâ€™ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything thatâ€™s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlinesâ€™ fault and that they didnâ€™t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. Iâ€™ve tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time Iâ€™ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me theyâ€™ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but itâ€™s been 2 months now and I havenâ€™t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didnâ€™t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that theyâ€™ll fully refund me, but arenâ€™t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what Iâ€™ve been through. Itâ€™s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews). Please- save your money, time, and health, and book a different airline.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: \"No, later, later\". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour\\'s at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. \"Of Course Sir, anything you want\". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The \"Onboard Chef\" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can\\'t say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I\\'ve flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don\\'t usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don\\'t really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.',\n",

I had a flight from JFK to Istanbul on the way to Dhaka and had a 12-hour long stay over in Istanbul. While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more, there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency, lack of decency (rude), and lower motivation to cooperate. However, instead of a hotel room, a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast, the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the â€œTransferâ€\\x9d station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they donâ€™t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wifeâ€™s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | My first time on Turkish. It\\'s not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it\\'s far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.) That just about put paid to everyone\\'s plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be. (How hard is it to say \"Good evening\" to a passenger during boarding, instead of giving an icy, silent stare?) In the future, unless I decide to travel to one of the secondary destinations served by TK, such as Salzburg or Lyon, my preference will remain with the more established airlines.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'Not Verified | Vienna to Istanbul. Our morning flight was delayed then eventually cancelled due to the bad weather which is understandable. We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days. The trip from Sabiha airport to our hotel itself costed us twice the price. Pray for our luggage. Hope Turkish Airlines take this matter seriously.',\n",

When we arrived to London we realized that the stroller was damaged. We started a claim case there at Heathrow airport. An online account was opened for us through which we filled in more information and received an evaluation which said that that THY would compensate the repair. We ordered two pieces of replacement covers and sent the receipts to THY. This was on the 19th of January. Since then we've been trying to resolve the case but we are being ignored. Today I talked to customer service for the 5th time. Every time I'm told that we should hear back in couple days but we never do. This is such a shame. What we claim is not even that much. If we were this responsive when we owed any money to THY we would be fined multiple times. They are getting away with it. It's such a shame for a company which claims to be world class.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to itÂ´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me \"No, tour is finished\". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that\\'s what I\\'m doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen. Instead, now I want a compensation.',\n",

When I got to the departure lounge, it was a 30 minute wait to pass immigration officials and to have my passport checked, A number of families moving to the UK slowed down the process. Pre Boarding failed at the families on hand did not understand English or Turkish languages. Boarding on to a new B737 was quick and excess cabin bags was controlled strictly at the gate. The cabin was very new, with a light and bright feel. The seat where average economy seats with reasonable leg room. The plane featured over head TV screens that showed a cheesy lego based pre flight video. The cabin crew was very good and offered an efficient service. Drinks where served after takeoff and a very Turkish meal was served an hour later, featuring rice, vegetables and kebab meat. A vegetarian option was available that looked like couscous. Drinks included fruit juice, sodas, beer and white wine. Inflight entertainment was limited to music and radio on 8 channels. Overall it was a pleasant flight and the seats where OK.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Tashkent to Istanbul. Check in Tashkent was chaos, People where checking in box's of eggs and fresh produce to sell in Istanbul. I quickly slipped into the business line and saved 20 minutes from the check in process. When we all assembled in the depart lounge the pre boarding sequence went out of the window. People standing closest to the door where on 1st. This ruffled a few business travellers big time. The airplane was a well used and tired aircraft, the interior was well used & featured cramped and un comfortable economy seats. Boarding was swift and the crew did a manual safety briefing, before a quick take off. The inflight services was a limited range of drinks and tea. The meal options where greasy riced based meals with donner meats. There was no flight entertainment. The flight was over soon enough and we disembarked on a jet way with easy connection to my next flight.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Tashkent. Got to the departure longue to find utter chaos, 100s of local people trying to board a flight, each carrying with 3 or 4 cabins bags, wedding dresses, quilts and electrical goods. The Turkish airlines staff did their best to bring control and remove bags from shopping happy Uzbeks. The boarding sequence did not work either. Reminds me of a rugby scrum at its best. We were bussed out to a well used aircraft with a very dated cabin. When I got to my window seat I found both seats full of stacked bags. Which had to be removed to the frustration of their owner. Turkish Airlines had an extra 6 or 7 staff on the flight trying to move what seemed 2 tonnes of bags into the hold and to sit people in there assigned seats. The flight had a delayed takeoff, which gave you time to look at a very tired interior, seats were old and lacked support. Leg room was zero and there was no IFE or video screens. The crew gave a manual safety demo and had to control people who wanted to change seats. The flight itself was OK, there was a basic drinks service and a simple meal of kebab meat and rice, there was no vegetation options that I could see off. The crew enforced a strict liquor policy from take off which worked well. Landing was OK and we where loaded into a bus from a remote parking space. Transit through Visa control and baggage collection was fast by Uzbek standards.',\n",

The cabin of this new 737 was clean and bright, for a economy seat the legroom was ok with a standard seat pitch of 34 or so inches. A cheesy safety video was shown before takeoff featuring lego figures. A little too cheesy after been shown twice, once in Turkish and once in English. Drinks were served after take off in a punctual fashion and was soon followed by a superb in flight meal of lamb kebab and rice, a good looking vegetarian Dahl was available too. Drinks included average wines and rice beer, along with soft drinks and Turkish coffee. The cabin crew where good and well turned out, including a chef working in the galley for business class passengers. The rest of the flight was fine. This plane did not feature IFE, other than some magzines. We were disembarked at a remote stand and spent 20 minutes on a bus trundling across a dark airfield to a packed transfer hall.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good. They do really discriminate passengers from different regions. Providing different services to different passengers.I have traveled quite a lot but never gotsuch treatment.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn\\'t select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn\\'t select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was \"it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass\"\" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn\\'t have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I\\'m not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport \"the next day.\" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn\\'t end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn\\'t have my bag. Then they said that they couldn\\'t pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a \"repair invoice\" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.',\n",

And everything about the flight was sub standard. The seat layout was at least 20 years old, when business class seats hardly just reclined. No storage space. The kit they provided had nothing in it. Cheap stuff. For an around 6 hour flight, no menu cards were provided. The crew serving never bothered to ask if passengers needed anything. One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect. They provided a menu card, the seats layout was modern. Like proper fully reclining seats. I feel awful the way they discriminate with flights from Pakistan.',\n",

We had booked our flights from Durban to Houston (return) which included a stopover of 2 days in Istanbul whereby our journey from Istanbul to Houston was on 16th December 2018 on flight number TK33 at 2.30pm. We had requested wheelchair service in advance. We checked-in on time at Istanbul Airport and waited more than 1 hour for the wheelchair assistant who never came and had to walk by ourselves to the gate. By the time we reached the gate we were denied boarding as they said that we are late. As a result, we had to buy another ticket on Turkish Airlines for 18th December 2018 at the airport which cost us TRY 21519 and this was through no fault of our own. The problem is that the wheelchair assistance never turned up which is the main reason for us being late. We have flown with other airlines and never faced this issue.

My return trip was yesterday, JFK to Ataturk, due to a 2.5 hours delay I lost my connection flight to Thessaloniki. When I came out of the plane there is no one to help me out with my flight, I was asking the ground staff and they talk to me in a rude and sarcastic manner because I dont speak Turkish. I was waiting in a very long line (100 people or more, all of them lost their connection flights) to change my ticket. My new ticket was at 20:15 evening and I had arrived at 9 am. I was waiting for 11 hours to go home! They take as at a hotel for almost 4 hours, the hotel and the ground staff had the worst attitude I have ever seen! They didn't show us any respect, long lines, no directions, no answers, no English, nothing except of rudeness. Now I'm home after 26 hours, instead of 14. For me Turkish is really the worst airline and has the worst ground stuff. Waste of money and time!\",\n",

They have EU Family visas and no return ticket is required. We were forced to purchase 3 tickets that were not needed at a cost of R27,000. The flight was delayed almost one hour due to a technical problem. Due to this delay we missed the connecting flight to Toulouse. Turkish Airlines staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring. The sales desk demanded I buy new tickets at a price of R40,000 ($2,800) and I refused. Customer service was pathetic. The helpline from the sales desk needed a Turkish speaker to understand the process. I was on the phone for over 30 minutes twice explaining what had happened, and was told to to wait a few hours.

Although the flight and flight crew on my trip from DC to Addis were lovely the crew, plane, food, and customer service on my return trip were horrendous. The food served between Istanbul and DC (return flight) was obviously spoiled and several people were sick as a result. The flight crew did nothing to reduce the impact (mess, smell) from this. The plane itself was dirty and several of the seats damaged in the economy class area. The restrooms (within the first 2-3 hours of the flight) ran out of toilet paper and the floors became covered in urine and worse.

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Khartoum to Amsterdam via Istanbul. I was very disappointed with the airport service at Istanbul. The employee told me to go the transfer desk when arriving at Istanbul to get my boarding ticket for Amsterdam and when I went to the transfer desk an employee told me to go to the Denied boarding office because there weren't any seats. I went to the Denied boarding office when it was the last call for my flight due to the excessive delay in the security control. The security control was packed with more than hundreds of people and some even climbed over the fences and it was very chaotic. Anyways when I went to the office the employee then told me that I missed my flight and asked why I came here. I explained everything to him but the only response I got was to go back to the transfer desk. Then when I went back to the transfer desk, the other employee told me to go to the ticket sales desk. I was expecting them to arrange a seat in a flight today but when i went to the ticket sales desk, the employee said that there were no remaining seats and booked me a seat in the next dayâ€™s flight and charged me 500 dollars when it was the airlineâ€™s fault. The service was awful and the employees did not even know how to swiftly deal with such situations.\",\n",

Over two hours into the flight to Erbil when I thought we were already descending, it was announced that we couldn\\'t land and were heading back to Istanbul on account of fog. This meant a 24 hour wait in the airport until the next flight which then was delayed another 90min. Then after everyone had boarded, two buses pull up, \"flight is cancelled\". At this point I could no longer wait, and had to fly back to Berlin. My original return would have been the day before. I spent two hours at the Turkish Airlines transfer desk with a lot of insisting and nerves to finally get this changed at the last minute to the next plane on the same day. The services there was just awful (around 1300 on Dec. 19). Initially I was told, \"everything\\'s ok, just sit there, and we will deliver the ticket to you.\" But as time went on and no one came, I had to go back to the desk and basically start from scratch, dealing with altogether 5 or six officials who spoke hardly any English and were disorganised to the point of reminding one of headless chickens. Also 2 hours of free airport wifi per week (!) is just not enough for a traveler under these circumstances. And there was no option to buy more with a credit card.',\n",

Crew didn\\'t assist passengers in transit (actually we could have caught the connection if they had checked the status of the next flight which was 45 min late) Connection missed.

Next step : 3 hours queue for the hotel transfer. Again no assistance from TK staff. Not even a glass of water. 11 pm, we finally arrive at the hotel - 1 room for 4 (children don\\'t count in that case, even if they pay a full ticket like adults), No dinner!

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Taipei to Sao Paulo via Istanbul. Worst service I had in my life! As Elite Plus even I was flying economy I have access to Business Class Lounge in any domestic or international flight flying Turkish, what was denied in Taipei my entrance. When I arrive at my seat someone was already seated, they changed me seat, and later I couldn't access internet, need to use from my miles. During flight other passengers in Business Class Received amenity kit and I didn't. I used miles for upgrade both ways and they gave boarding pass just for first sector, I asked Purser about the amenity and as well my ticket second sector because in a previous flight I had same bad experience. They said you should do a feedback form. Waiting answer until now. They used more miles than the top limit on their system that is 75000 miles from Far East to South America, they deducted 100.000 miles. They damage my luggage on arrival. The asked invoice from the luggage I had, and denied payment saying the luggage is fixable, just come and fix for me. The miles accrued was to be 100% on the fare I bought they gave me around 50%. Amazing company!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Athens via Istanbul. This was the worst airline I have flown with. I booked my tickets last minute, it was for me and my 4 month old son. I had 3 suitcases a stroller and 2 carryons. I had paid for the suitcases, but because I was traveling alone I went there with my husband and he politely asked if they could please take the carryons on the plane because she canâ€™t carry everything by herself. The manager came out and said that we have to pay. I said I already paid extra for my suitcases please help us because my wife is carrying our son, the diaper bag and 2 carryons. He was rude stating that we have to pay each carryon. We didnâ€™t have the extra money and my wife took everything with her. If thatâ€™s how Turkish Airline treats their customers, they shouldnâ€™t be operating. It was the last time I use this airline. No dignity or humanity, itâ€™s all only about the money. And when I took the stroller with my son. They made me package the stroller by myself looking that I had my son on me crying and when I asked for help they said that they canâ€™t help me... unbelievable... they see me with 2 carryons a stroller and a baby and they canâ€™t help me.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Bangkok via Istanbul. I traveled with Turkish Airlines on business class back to Bangkok. The check-in was fast as there weren't any queue and the staff work very professionally. i received a priority pass at the security. The airport is huge so I need sometime to walk to the gate. I visited the United Airlines lounge near the gate which was large, modern, clean, had friendly staff and had wide selection of food and drinks. After staying in the lounge I headed to the gate early like it said on the time board but I had to wait at the gate very long and the queue as disorganized and passenger both business and economy were held for another half an hour before boarding. After boarding, I got welcomed by the crew handed out a welcome drink and a menu for lunch. The seat was fully flat, modern and comfortable but the remote control was old and the distance to the magazines was unacceptable and the storage areas was poor. The flight was delayed as the traffic at Heathrow was bad. The in-flight entertainment system which had wide selection of movies, TV programs and many more. The meal was served an hour after takeoff, the food made up of Turkish food which was nice but it tasteless and the option in the menu was poor. The toilet was clean and modern. The flight arrived on time in Istanbul. The airport was crowded, old and had lack of renovation. Fortunately, I had an access to the lounge which was large,clean but crowded, lack of food options and seats. I spent and hour before head to the gate for my flight to Bangkok. The airport was huge and I nearly missed the priority boarding as the time board show the gate late. The service and facilities was the same as the previous flight but the seat included the amenity kit which is really useful on this 10 hour flight. The crew weren't friendly on this flight and not motivated. The flight arrived in Bangkok in the afternoon on the next day on time. I received another priority pass to went through the passport control. My bag arrived on time also. Overall, the airline itself had a good service and business class facilities but the crew should be more friendly and the airport issues should be fixed.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Vienna to Riyadh via Istanbul. Biggest problem with this airline is its home airport. Istanbul Ataturk has huge capacity problems. Because of that most flights are delayed and there are no places to sit while waiting for a delayed flight. Then really amateur services kick in when the employees start calling for all passengers to group in the back of the room for passport check only to move again to the front after that for the boarding. The fact that I booked extra legroom seat and a plane was changed without any notification (resulting in regular seat) only adds to an unpleasant experience. This was not a low-cost flight, but services appeared so. Food and on-board services won't fix these problems.\",\n",

There was no need for this that was ever explained to me, leading me to conclude it was carelessness and incompetence when I did my baggage drop. They changed my seats during baggage drop. Then, they messed up and put an infant in an emergency row seat. So then I had an infant put beside me along with his father, whereas before that I had an empty seat beside me.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100â‚¬ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360â‚¬ per person to 680â‚¬ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn\\'t do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is \"still in process\" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. Middle East airlines was definitely a good experience, I had a problem once with Aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Los Angeles. Ground crew is just terribly unhappy. Rude and condescending. They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and thatâ€™s Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me itâ€™ll be 45 min and they canâ€™t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something donâ€™t leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldnâ€™t care. I would say go pay a little more and pick better service. Itâ€™s not that I lost something, itâ€™s how the crew treated me after having dropped an item that I could have retrieved if they had let me look for it',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines needs to offer transfer service options (maybe even check in at pick up location) like Emirates does if it wants to remain competitive as the current arrangements for the new Istanbul Airport are greatly inadequate. The check-in kiosks are still not operating reliably. TGS staff were present to offer assistance. However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities. Boarding conducted in a orderly manner and on-time departure. The 2Ã—2 seating business class product on this fairly new 737-800 is as good as it gets with IFE and ample space. The breakfast offering was of good quality with a tasety Turkish cheese selection and cold cuts. The scrambled eggs main dish was average. Very good selection in the bread basket. Attentive crew and smooth landing on time arrival to Baku, which is probably the best airport in the region and a pleasure to fly in to. TK offering a very good onboard product with major shortcomings on the ground, IT and customer service side devaluing their product.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines is the best domestic service and value within Europe. Turkish domestic flights across the board are quite cheap by EU and US standards, having paid $40 for a flight comparable to Boston-New York or London-Paris. Boarding was quite speedy and orderly, and what a treat to be on an enormous long-haul aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER on such a short route, really feels special. Legroom and seat width are stellar by domestic or international standards, with a very neat and clean appearance. Inflight entertainment was not activated for this roughly hour-long journey, but a standard Turkish-style warm cheese sandwich was provided, the quality of which rivals $9 buy on board options in the USA. Cabin crew, of course, were professional and quick but not rushed. Arrival into Izmir was smooth, and we arrived at an actual gate, as opposed to needing to take a bus from a remote stand. Overall, this journey was well worth spending a few more bucks than the bus or flying Pegasus.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'Not Verified | Toronto to Cairo via Istanbul. Worst experience ever. On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just donâ€™t take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service. All I wanted from them was to give exact and clear information on what can be done to deal with them being late. Instead, they just let us wander around and wasted Everyoneâ€™s time. Never again will I go with them even if the alternative is more expensive.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Ankara to Frankfurt on Turkish Airlines. Quick check in using the priority counter. Following passport control headed to the lounge which was too warm and had the very basic selection of food and beverages. This lounge is worlds away from TKâ€™s lounge in Istanbul and one of the worst I have ever visited. The WiFi did not work despite repeated attempts. Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FAâ€™s went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as â€œPriorityâ€\\x9d my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such. I have been using TK regularly in recent years and the decline in quality has been steady. The next time I travel to Turkey, I will most likely choose a different carrier.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FAâ€™s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FAâ€™s do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations. This is a very concerning display of TKâ€™s safety culture and raises questions about the rest of their operations.',\n",

The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESB-IST flight which over-hastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. IST-AMS service was alright, although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere, only getting worse. Also, the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible - barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of low-cost carriers.

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Amsterdam via Istanbul to Havana return. I'm really satisfied with the overall performance of THY. The seat pitch is quite good. A lot of choices and a very good responsive personal entertainment system, the food is really good and the quantity of the food they offered you is certainly enough. You receive an amenity kit on the long haul flight, which is a nice touch. There is live television and WiFi on board, but the Wifi was quite expensive. The live television worked perfect, I could watch a live soccer match! Downside is that the crew sometimes a bit tired looks and act. The layover in Istanbul is a bit chaotic. My bags arrived in Havana and also on the way back in Amsterdam. My conclusion is that Turkish Airlines offers a good product, when you compare it with the price. I would choose them again and can recommend them.\",\n",

Boarding queuing up everyone in the queue for a while they decided to call rows out we were nearly first going in and nearly last by the end not a good start, went down hill from there on.  Seats mixed up even though we asked for certain seats luckily some people swapped with us - we asked one one of the staff could they please sort the seats out, they didn't care. We had to do it ourself as we have 2 small daughters not sitting beside us. Nothing for kids no kids menu or kids toys or colouring books to keep them entertained for the flights. .The staff from Istanbul to Phuket were the worst most miserable people we have ever came across on a flight. Spilling drinks on customers not smiling didn't want to be there. Turkish have a long way to go to catch up with other airlines. Food was only ok nothing special. Plane was quite old looking, business class looked nothing special. Overall very disappointing going over and back.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs. Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight. This flight and this airport is never to be recommended.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadn't flown Turkish in 4 years, and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777, even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual, not enough gates at Ataturk airport, and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning. Again, this problem should be solved when the move to the New Istanbul Airport happens hopefully in early January 2019.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Montreal. The boarding process was interesting. Firstly, you cannot do online check-in as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves. We departed slightly late but landed almost 20 minutes early which was the cherry on top.\",\n",

Then I arrived at my final destination that was Bogota, Colombia. They lost the whole flight bags.

They never gave me an answer about my bags, lather they started to ignore my emails or calls, lather they told me to stop calling them!

TK has a few check-in counters operational for limited international operations. Self check-in kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge, just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for B/C and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew. The hard product also very good with 2x2 seating, IFE and fresh looking cabin on this relatively new 737-800.

Through security - seems to have modern systems which speed up the process. As yet they don't have their Business Class lounge open. Instead was invited to a small cafe where various complimentary items were offered. Served by two extremely courteous young guys. Boarding on time. During the flight a hot light meal served.

Hadn\\'t even been on an aircraft with a 2-4-2 seating arrangement, but this is perfect for couples (was travelling with fiancÃ©e) as no need to disturb anyone else if needing out of our seats. Cabin crew were professional and efficient in meal and drinks services. Enjoyed the safety video, if a bit cheesy! Some downsides would be only adequate leg room for a 6\\'3\" man like myself, expensive on board WIFI ($9.99 for a hour) and cabin crew turning a blind eye to foolhardy impatient passengers who insisted on getting up and opening the overhead lockers while the plane was still taxiing! Finally, I always believe it\\'s good practice for a cabin crew member to do an announcement to welcome passengers to the destination, especially on a long haul flight, however this was not done on any of the four flights I took. No major complaints however and would fly with them again.',\n",

Youâ€™re simply asked to fill a â€œfeedbackâ€\\x9d form and they will get back to you in 2-3 months. Whilst making a booking, picked Mr instead of Ms, when we rang the company we were told we needed to buy a new ticket. Apparently once you make a purchase you can not amend anything on this ticket. Is this a joke? The whole policy is set out in a way that exploits the customer. Every single change costs hundreds of Â£Â£Â£. Even something as simple as changing title will now cost an additional Â£500 for a new ticket. How can you have a system so inefficient. How are you selling yourself as leading airline provider and you canâ€™t even work with the customer to make such simple changes and youâ€™re demanding a full ticket to be repaid.

Having read previous reviews I was a little worried as we were transferring through Istanbul with a very short time between flights. However everything was perfect with efficient boarding procedures and plenty of time to find the boarding gates in Istanbul. Staff were very polite and friendly and food was fine. All in all I was pleasantly surprised and I would travel with them again.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Lvov to Johannesburg via Istanbul. The first leg was flown by a A321. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The plane seemed to be pretty old, with an old school PTV - there is PTV, but it's not touchscreen nor anything on demand, you could only choose from the few existing channels. Since it's a flight less than 2 hours so it's not a big problem. A excellent light meal was served. I had a long layout in Istanbul so I left the airport for a while. Istanbul airport was a bit crowded, that's why the new airport is opening soon. The next flight, IST-JNB, is on a A333. The food was also good - probably the best food I've ever had in economy, but there's only one option if you didn't book special meal, so it might be a problem with some people. The seat pitch wasn't very good for a long haul flight but still acceptable. Amenities were good. Overall, I was impressed and would definitely like to travel with TK next time.\",\n",

After reading the reviews I understand that I am not the only one, so yes all the bad reviews are accurate don't waste your time with this airline pay a little bit more and get better service. They might have good deals for their flights but trust me you will pay. Specially for a long flight and you don't want to bother with their rudeness not only in the cabin but specially with their horrible check in counter staff can't care less. Also if you don't speak Turkish you are totally screwed. I flown to Asia before for 17 hours plus.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g. A honeymoon), I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip. Thank you for ruining our honeymoon journey.',\n",

She was being cared for but suddenly her health deteriorated further. Naturally I had to go home as soon as possible, we had to cancel our trip. My son, who had lost his grandmother had to deal with the customer service employee who was unempathetic and dismissive. We wanted to change our return tickets which was from Hong Kong to Istanbul on Sunday and asked them to change it to Beijing to Istanbul on Wednesday. We were told by the Turkish Airlines representative we had to pay the price of a new ticket because our ticket was no-change, but we could get the refund after we present them with the death certificate of my late mother. We had to take this option as we had to be there on time for my mothers funeral. When I went to the Turkish Airlines office in Turkey after 10 days, they told me I cannot get a refund because I already used my ticket. I told them this is what the customer service told me, and the reply is \"There is nothing we can do\". But it was the Turkish Airlines representative who persuaded us not to cancel our flights and change them instead. Turkish Airlines deliberately gave us false information on this subject and lied to us for the price of two tickets!

Alas, on neither my London to Istanbul flight or Istanbul flight did I get it. Not great. Then with a flight leaving at 10.35am - they decide to serve breakfast (about 11.30). Most of us have got up at 6 am to get this flight - what about serving lunch instead? However, this is all minor stuff - what really annoyed me is for the second leg of my return flight (Istanbul to London) they seated me and my partner apart. This is despite the fact that we booked our tickets ages ago! Forgetting common sense, you would have through it pretty basic - wherever possible, seat people who book together, together. It's not rocket science! Despite a call from Addis to Istanbul (which annoyingly cost me over Â£20) to their call centre - there is nothing they can do about this! Question - so if the plane doesn't even do flat seats, and then they don't even seat you together - why fly Turkish Business?\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn\\'t quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn\\'t. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to \"contact a different department\", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That\\'s normal. What wasn\\'t normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that \"we are a third party engaged by the airline\" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR. Case is not yet closed.',\n",

In a narrowbody aircraft type we weren't expecting any IFE, but much to our pleasant surprise, there was and a huge international selection at that! Even though it was barely a 2 hour flight, it made the experience a lot more comfortable. Check in counters were smooth and efficient and did their job well. Seat pitch presented a decent amount of legroom for a narrowbody plane. Breakfast served was delicious too, and with metal cutlery no less! First time on Turkish and I'm impressed. Only downside are the long queues while transiting in Istanbul but I hope that would be sorted out after the new airport opens next month.\",\n",

Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good. Because of the delay, we were short of time in Istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security. The flight from Istanbul to Ercan was aboard a A321 with the 2+2 seating layout. Boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport. The flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes so it was not too bad, but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin. The seats were not particularly comfortable and the seat adjust buttons did not seem to work. The meal on this flight was superb. The flight attendants were efficient and did their best on this short flight.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Our flight from Venice to Nairobi provided a two-hour stopover in Istanbul. Two weeks before departure we were advised that the flight to Istanbul Nairobi had been anticipated and that therefore we would have had only one hour of call but that we would have done it easily (before confirming the acceptance of the flight change, we talked with the customer service Turkish who gave us confirmation - I hope that the phone calls are recorded, as well as an email in which we confirmed that we would have made it). As expected, the flight from Venice to Istanbul leaves late. We get off the plane at 18.05. The flight to Nairobi would leave at 18.40 but already on the panel appeared written \"gate closed\". We go to the gate and at 18.15 we are there the flight was due to leave at 18.40) and the gate is actually closed and the plane has already left. They send us to a desk for customer support that is not the right one and we find out after 10 minutes of waiting thanks to another customer who warns us. After having gone through 3 Turkish desk (Ataturk airport is not really small ...) we arrive at the correct one where in an absolutely rude manner they warn us that we would have to wait 24 hours for the next plane. Without baggage. They still give us assistance by providing us with a hotel and full board. They ask us if we prefer it near the airport or the center of istanbul and we ask that it be the center. They make us get on a bus without telling us where we were going and leave us in a hotel near the airport ... no ifs and buts, without even the foresight to say: sorry in the center was all full. We lose 24 hours of vancaza, the hotel booked in Nariobi, the various visits etc. ruined holiday. We are asking for a refund. They are denying it. saying that we agreed to have only 1 hour stopover: we agreed to have 1 hour of call, true - we never agreed to lose the connection. (mail and turkish phone calls in hand) we go ahead and we do not give up. (nothing to complain about the convenience of flight, meals etc, all unexceptionable). IT: l nostro volo da Venezia a Nairobi prevedeva uno scalo di due ore ad Istanbul. Due settimane prima della partenza siamo stati avvisati che il volo Istanbul Nairobi era stato anticipato e che quindi avremmo avuto solo un\\'ora di scalo ma che ce l\\'avremmo fatta agevolmente (prima di confermare l\\'accettazione del cambio volo, abbiamo parlato con il customer service Turskish che ci ha dato conferma - spero che le telefonate siano registrate, oltre che ad una mail in cui ci confermavano che ce l\\'avremmo fatta). Come c\\'era da aspettarsi, il volo da Venezia ad Istanbul parte in ritardo. Scendiamo dall\\'aereo alle 18.05. Il volo per Nairobi sarebbe partito alle 18.40 ma giÃ\\xa0 sul pannello compariva scritto \"gate closed\". Ci fiondiamo al gate e alle 18.15 siamo lÃ¬ (ribadisco il volo sarebbe dovuto partire alle 18.40) ed il gate Ã¨ effettivamente chiuso e l\\'aereo Ã¨ anche giÃ\\xa0 partito. Ci mandano ad un desk per assistenza clienti che non Ã¨ quello corretto e lo scopriamo dopo 10 minuti di attesa grazie ad un\\'altra cliente che ci avvisa. Dopo per essere passati per 3 desk Turkish ( l\\'aeroporto Ataturk non Ã¨ proprio piccolo... ) arriviamo a quello corretto dove in maniera assolutamente sgarbata ci avvisano che avremmo dovuto aspettare 24 ore per l\\'aereo successivo. Senza bagaglio. Ci danno comunque assistenza fornendoci un albergo e pensione completa. Ci chiedono se lo preferiamo vicino all\\'aeroporto o al centro di istanbul e chiediamo che sia il centro. Ci fanno salire su di un pulmino senza dirci dove stessimo andando e ci lasciano in un albergo vicino all\\'aeroporto ... senza se e senza ma, senza neanche l\\'accortezza di dire: ci spiace in centro era tutto full. Perdiamo 24 ore di vancaza, l\\'albergo prenotato a Nariobi, le varie visite etc. vacanza rovinata. Stiamo chiedendo il rimborso. Ce lo stanno negando. dicendo che abbiamo accettato di avere solo 1 ora di scalo: abbiamo accettato di avere 1 ora di scalo, vero. non abbiamo mai accettato di perdere la coincidenza. (mail e telefonate turkish alla mano) andiamo avanti e non ci arrendiamo. (niente da ridire sulla comoditÃ\\xa0 del volo, pasti etc, tutto ineccepibile)',\n",

We requested mobility assistance and the customer service reassured us that it is already fixed. When we arrived in Istanbul airport, the flight crew who assisted me get off the plane just left us without any explanation or instruction. We were clueless where should we go and where should we wait. When we asked an airport staff, he just told us in a rude manner to stay where we are and wait for the assistance for the next flight. We were so unsure and worried so we asked again a ground crew if there is an assistance coming to help me. I am handicapped and cannot walk so we really need this assistance.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew with Turkish Airlines on the 2nd of September from Dhaka-Istanbul-London. Don't get me wrong, the service was good. Food was decent, and entertainment was also pretty good. However the one thing that Turkish Airlines is really poor on is transit flight. The airport staff are slow, very ruthless and have no courtesy at all. You may say this is the airport's fault, but this was mainly seen from Turkish Airlines staff. The staff on my flight were a bit rude, and when you asked for something to drink, you would need to ask repeatedly as they wouldn't bring you a drink. Anyways, our flight was delayed from Istanbul. No surprise. Made us feel like we were flying on a really bad airline and especially due to the delays at both Dhaka and Istanbul. We landed at London, only to find out that half of the plane's luggage did not arrive. All the transit flight luggage were missing and consequently delayed. It's now been 6 days since I've flown, and I have not received some of the luggage. It's appalling especially when its with an airline you have huge expectations for. I don't know how on earth they lost that many bags, but it just shows how unprofessional and un-trained their staff are at their 'hub airport'. I just hope you all never face this in the future. And to make sure about that avoid, avoid, avoid.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Bangkok to London via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines gave me an impressive service to me along the flight. They gave me priority pass for security in Bangkok and passport control in London, but not in Istanbul. Both aircraft have comfortable seat and wide range of facilities. The In-flight entertainment have wide range of movies and TV programs but poor option of games. Since I sat on window seats on both flights it quite difficult to get out while seat of the neighbor is recline. The crew were friendly and helpful. The food selection were fairly wide but the taste weren't very impressive. The seat have facilities like USB port and power outlet which was fast but place in difficult area to reach. The magazines etc were difficult to reach as they were located near the personal screen, which is large. The pilot of both flights were informative and make an impressive smooth landings. The lounge in Bangkok (Eva Air lounge) and in Istanbul was modern and have wide range of food selection. However, the only thing I didn't like is Turkish Airlines Hub, Istanbul Airport which is small, crowded and unorganized.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Prague on Turkish Airlines. Following a smooth check-in processed by a helpful and pleasant agent we made our way to the lounge. The lounge was crowded but there was ample space compared to the cramped, noisy and hot main terminal. Istanbul airport is a nightmare unless you have access to the Turkish Airlines lounge. After a few beverages and snacks we made our way to the gate. Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FAâ€™s was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline. They are rude, unprofessional and have extremely poor language skills. Turkish has to deal with this deficiency as a matter of priority otherwise they will at best be a mediocre carrier.',\n",

Then he wanted me to verify my residence in Istanbul and other details which he had no business asking. It was as if he was punishing me for not upgrading for an additional $250. He was not a customs officer nor a representative of the Turkish embassy whom i had provided financial details and following which they had granted me my visa. When i showed him my hotel booking he asked me to leave the counter. The entire experience was unlike anything i have encountered before and what shocked me even further was that upon submitting a complaint to Turkish Airlines, I received a standard PR generated response which was frankly laughable.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Dubrovnik to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. I have flown with different airlines and have gone to many airports. But, Turkish wins hands down in terms of bad experience. I dare say even budget airlines are better. Turkish Airlines delayed the first flight from Dubrovnik to Istanbul by an hour which means thereâ€™s a high possibility of missing my connecting flight. When I arrived in Istanbul, earlier flights are listed on the board showing which gate to go to. Since it isnâ€™t there, I asked an airport crew where should I go. He rudely told me â€œcheck on the board.â€\\x9d If the plane has flown, itâ€™s basic courtesy to inform me instead of telling me which gate to go to. After running all the way, I saw an empty gate. I went to a Turkish Airlines counter only to be sent from one counter to another. I was sent to other 4 counters in total. How you handle this situation is horrendous. Iâ€™ve never come across such rude, unapproachable and unfriendly customer service throughout my entire life. This is uncalled for and very disappointing.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. Itâ€™s the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that Iâ€™ve ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. Iâ€™m amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it canâ€™t even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience. Looking forward to seeing how they resolve my ongoing problems! Travellers beware when booking international connections with Turkish Airlines - the cheaper fares could truly deliver a cheap and nasty experience youâ€™ll remember for a long time!',\n",

Beside the very short connection in Istanbul that caused me had to run for the next flight, it was a quite good experience. It started with a friendly checkin staff that moved us to the emergency exit row so I had plenty of legroom for my 190cm. Service onboard was good with nice meal for a 3h flight, and crew was a very friendly. The only issue was that they was that they didn't provide gate info for the next flight from Istanbul and our 55 minutes layover was only 40min because of delay on first flight, so we had to run for the most remote gate. Flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was older B777 with 3-3-3 config, with legroom thais equal to Emirates B777 but wider seats. IFE not at the same level as Emirates and old screen. Friendly crew and nice meal. Seat selection is free on Turkish website under manage booking, thats a plus compared to that it has become expensive on Emirates on the 3 cheapest booking classes by Emirates.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | A disappointing start to our family holiday of a lifetime! Shocking customer service. No communication. Rude, aggressive and miserable staff. Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick â€“ Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldnâ€™t tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldnâ€™t go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didnâ€™t think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying. They then put half of our group in Business class half in economy. An absolute shambles. Never fly with this airline, they were horrendous in every aspect.',\n",

They divided us into business, economy row 27 which worked really well. Standard Turkish Airlines economy cabin, the seat itself not very comfortable, okay legroom. Not better or worse than any other economy seat on a wide-body plane. I usually love the food on Turkish Airlines, both quality and quantity-wise. However this time, the food wasn't as good as it used to be, especially the rice. (It hasn't been that long since I last flew Turkish). Quantity-wise it was fine, we got served dinner, snacks and a breakfast. The crew, on the other hand, was outstanding. Way better than any other TK flight I've taken. They were really nice and helpful, and actually wanted to talk to people! There were plenty of new films on the IFE system. I usually don't watch any films on the IFE, but I watched 4 films this time! We departed on time and actually landed early (I think they do it in case they need to fly around IST before landing).

I bought 3 tickets and for most part this airline is rather cheaper than its competitors such as Emirates and Qatar. However, you do pay a price with horrible customer service and in flight food menu. Their customers service representatives provide nearly no accurate information. Staff won't be very polite and if you lose baggage you are pretty much on your own. Makeover, it is really challenging to understand the English language of their representatives over the phone.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Dubai. My flight was at 12:30am, and I was off to the airport by 8pm. Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didnâ€™t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, itâ€™s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to itâ€™s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldnâ€™t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldnâ€™t even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers. I will never ever fly them again - hell they are not even the cheapest, just spend that few extra hundred to be on Emirates or other more reputable airline. They donâ€™t deserve to be in the skies and in business.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. For some reason the flight to Istanbul was delayed in about 25 minutes so instead of 75 minutes I only had 50 minutes for the connection. Once landed crew called all passengers to Tel Aviv to hurry up (a delay that was caused because of you), now obviously I was in a hurry and thought it\\'s good that they are aware of the problem and since operating both flights probably leave the gate open a few more minutes. I got to the gate and they just closed it, the ground crew was still there and had last passengers on the jet bridge. Frustrating as it was seeing the plane just standing there for about half hour and the only thing separating me from getting back to my mother\\'s funeral on time was a door. I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I\\'m not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight. The answer I got is: \"Lounge is only for business passengers\" so I\\'m not allowed to go there and I can use one of the restaurant\\'s free wi-fi (obviously didnâ€™t work). So had to wait 5 hours for the next flight feeling like nobody cares and really trying to help me. It was not just one of your employees, I spoke to about 8 different people trying to explain my situation and they all kept sending me back and forth until I realized they are just trying to get rid of me. I would not fly with Turkish Airlines if known they are not able to get me in time for the funeral. I never post this kind of things, but I got such a disrespectful service! and think people should know they are the worst!',\n",

Turkish Airlines Customer Relations asked me do not worry and promised that Turkish Airlines will take care of the hotel accommodation very well. They assured that there IST hotel desk will arrange to ensure hotel accommodation will be provided. When I arrived at IST and they refused dumped me away from standard service/accommodation and IST airport staff at hotel desk said that they will not provide me a hotel or tour with breakfast for my long layover 20 hours at Istanbul. I realized that Turkish Airlines is not honest did not follow ethics practice and fooled me against their advertising about stopover program with hotel and tour. I am concerned with Turkish Airlines's lack of integrity and assurance. I slept on floor mat during long layover 20 hours at IST airport. From my understanding, Turkish Airlines website posted all information online that economy class passengers will have a hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast during long layover. They treated me poorly because I am deaf passenger and passenger with disability. I do not appreciate Turkish Airlines' fraud with hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast that were not provided actually. I lost trust in Turkish Airlines. I feel regretting to purchase a ticket and choose to fly with Turkish Airlines. I spent wasted $30 visa for nothing at IST and I did not see Istanbul during stopover - long layover 20 hours. Turkish Airlines put me to sleep on floor mat at IST for a long layover that was disgraceful.\",\n",

My flight from Sofia to Istanbul was delayed 45 min and I missed the connection flight from Istanbul to Cairo and they delayed my trip another 6 hours. finally when itâ€™s time for the flight they changed the gate number 5 times within half an hour - time running like crazy between gates, very disrespectful employees at the counter, rudeness and attitude. Also called the customer service to see if I can upgrade my ticket when I go back to Chicago from Cairo they told me you can do it at the airport, went to the help desk after waiting an hour in line they told me we canâ€™t do anything here you have to go to an agency office.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Bucharest to Dubai via Istanbul and back. The flight from Bucharest to Istanbul was ok, only 55 minutes time, but they provided snacks and drinks which is wonderful considering the flight time. Istanbul to Dubai on Boeing 777-300er, new plane and excelent cabin crew, they served dinner and beverages. The flight was on time. On the return leg, Dubai to Istanbul, the aircraft was Airbus A330-300, with a 2-4-2 configuration, which was better for us. The plane was a bit older than the previous one, but the entertaining system was ok, plenty of choices to watch. Cabin crew were wonderful, you can tell that they are hard working and also very professional. The only inconvenient is Ataturk airport because it is too crowded, there are a lot of flights departing and landing at the same time and you have to spend a lot of time in the aircraft untill take off and also after landing which causes delays. There werenâ€™t any problems with the luggage, but I think that the ground staff that handles the luggage should be more careful as the suitcases came a little bit damaged after the flights. I saw that they are throwing them quite hard when handling. All in all, I would recommend Turkish Airlines.',\n",

You are stuck. The wait time is long over the phone to hear they canâ€™t help you and they are rude as well.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Kinshasa to Brussels via Istanbul. I used to be a fan of Turkish Airlines, flew them several time and rarely had an issue - but that was about 2 years ago! Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage. And cherry on the cake, I've been stuck at home all day waiting for them to deliver my suitcases (were supposed to do it from 1pm to 6pm, then from 6pm to 8pm - it's 8:43pm and still nothing). I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet. Never have I seen such disorganization, lack of communication and disdain for customers. And with all that, they don't even bother to send an apology email, or offer compensation - nothing! Dont fly them!! They used to be good, but clearly not anymore.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Madrid. I quite like Turkish Airlines and have flown them extensively throughout the world, in both economy and in the no-longer-existent Comfort Class. This was my first trip, using miles, to fly in Business Class. The crew was attentive, well-groomed and projected a nice, professional image. The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings. No menu, a surprise, and the crew rolled a cart down the aisle showing unwrapped entrees. I selected the fish and sad to say it felt like I was eating a 5TL fish sandwich on the Eminonou dock. The entrÃ©e was very poor quality, tasteless, and cheap. It cost me a lot of miles and a lot of euros to take this flight',\n",

The next day nothing happened and I called them. Quite surprisingly I found out that they know nothing about the luggage they even don't know in which country is my luggage at the moment, meaning the THY assistant on the desk lied to me in a very professional way. I has been couple of days now and heard nothing. No one is contacted - besides I then saw the report that the initial guy wrote, the color of my luggage was written wrong and the flight number I took was completely wrong.

I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.\",\n",

They came to me at the end of both segments to ask whether I liked the service and enjoyed the flight. Old business class seat on the Singapore to Istanbul route: this seat type should be removed by Turkish as it is uncompetitive. Had a good sleep though as the space for legs is excellent. Meal quality and quantity great. I was pleased to see that Turkish is testing the dine on-demand concept on the Singapore to Istanbul route. I was told that such a concept will be gradually introduced across all their long-haul flights. Ataturk airport crazy busy as usual - looking forward to the opening of the new airport in October. Due to very bad weather over India, the first flight landed in Istanbul behind schedule and one of my four luggage did not make it to the final destination. It arrived to Venice with the following flight and was delivered on the same day by the airline directly to my place.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Manila to Istanbul via flight TK85 and reached Istanbul at 5:20AM. I changed my flight from Istanbul to Tel Aviv to 11AM from the 6PM flight, paid U$81.00 and was assured that my check-in luggage will be transferred to the same flight. When I reached Tel Aviv, my check-in luggage was not in the same flight, nor in the next flight. I submitted a complaint note and my luggage was delivered to my hotel the next day. It was a big hassle for me because I was to attend a business conference at Tel Aviv Convention centre. Airline does not have the service that they promised passenger despite the fact that I paid for the changed flight. They also have very poor cabin service on TK85 in a sense that while I was still eating, the stewardess took the tray because she said that it was time for them to pull back trays. The service is too mechanical.',\n",

Make sure to check out their reviews online before you buy a ticket from them. Dealing with Turkish Airlines is a nightmare. They have very poor customer service, the employees are very rude, \"unfriendly and unprofessional\". They seem to have a â€œno smileâ€\\x9d policy. They will not listen to your needs and ignore your complaints. They will not take responsibility or apologize to make up for your losses when they screw up. I do not recommend using Turkish Airlines.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I travelled with Turkish Airlines from Calgary to Nairobi via Istanbul on July 1st (arrived on the 3rd). When I got to Kenya, my bags didnâ€™t make it. There were many other people in the same situation, as there was a big line up at their counter. After waiting for at least an hour, the agent told me the bags were in Turkey and that they would be delivered sometime in the next 2 days. Iâ€™m lucky I had some spare clothes in my carry-on. I called Turkish everyday ever since and just yesterday (July 4th) they told me they basically have no idea where my 2 suitcases are. All agents are very unhelpful and have no idea what is going on. I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didnâ€™t even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things. Now, Iâ€™m stuck in Africa for 20 days with no bags, no clothes, and Turkish has not even offered me any type of compensation. I was travelling on Business Class and thatâ€™s how they treat their Business Class flyers.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Istanbul to Manila. Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect. I wanted Turkish Arlines to be good, sorry to say they are not, they are way behind other carriers on the Manila route, way behind other carriers on long haul routes, its certainly a case of running before they can walk.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Algiers to Manchester via Istanbul. I have the same experience word by word as below my review. I missed my connection flight. My first Turkish Airlines plane was late, and the second plane has gone 10 minutes before dest. time. The screen has shown \"go to gate\". But the plane was nowhere. Everybody was so rude at the airport, helpless and their attitude was awful. Finally I had to buy a ticket for the next flight for 342 pounds, because they told me, the plane us full, I can travel only on business class, where actually was a very poor service. Customer service a joke, it was the worst ever.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flight-time 20:05 as the check-in time for 22:05. After a two-week holiday, my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror, I discovered that the gate was closed! And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport. On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore. The night pack contains the most useful things for a more comfortable flight.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Zurich to Delhi via Istanbul. I landed Istanbul at 18:40 and after security checks and all took 25 minutes. My next flight was at 20:20. I was confused to go to which gate to take my next flight. I asked few people to find a way. I got to know i have to go to gate no 504. So moved to gate number 504. I reached there at 19:57. The guy who was at boarding counter told me that gates are closed. I told him how is it possible as I have the boarding pass and still there are 23 minutes left. Then he asked me to go to the transfer desk and assure me they will help me in this matter. I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high. When I paid the entire money and have nothing left out I asked them I have no money left for anything to eat. They told me they will provide food every 5 hour - once i got the new ticket and after 14 hour I reached them and asked for food and they denied even for tea. Next day when I boarded the flight, flight delayed for 1:30 hour and we waited without our fault.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats. There seems to be a problem with the seat plan they are looking at, which is likely inconsistent with the real seats of the plane. I probably will not take this airline again.',\n",

The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.\",\n",

Arriving at Istanbul the airport is literally a shopping mall with all staff who donâ€™t speak neither English nor French only Turkish! Good luck finding you gate on your own. The return trip was a nightmare, the flight from Kenya was late and believe or not when I arrived at Istanbul the clerk at the desk said I missed my connection flight, although I had 20 minutes before itâ€™s departure but of course not as they donâ€™t use tunnels, only buses at Istanbul.',\n",

Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations. The Istanbul Ataturk airport also has plenty of shopping and eating options, smoking area. Overall my experience has been very positive with Turkish Airlines, despite the above mentioned hiccup which they fairly rectified. I would and definitely will fly with them again.\",\n",

Before boarding the plane, I chose to have my seats near the exits as I was 6 months pregnant. However, when I boarded the plane, I was told by the guy sitting next to me that I was not supposed to be seated beside him as he told the air steward that he wanted my seat for him and his son. I sat down anyway, as I was not told of it. 5 mins later, the air steward told me to change my seats to accommodate the father and son, and I was moved all the way to the back of the plane. Best part, I have requested for special meals to be served, however, they did not update my special meal request even when they were the one who forced me to have my seats changed. So Turkish is hinting me that you can paid for 2 seats and request for 3? Mind you, it was the seats in the first few rows.

The boarding process was done by letters and was very without issues. Onboard I was impressed with the cleanliness of the aircraft and how new it was (no more than 3-5 years old). The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well. Flight was operated with an A330-200 which I found odd for such a short leg. Very clean plane, relatively new and same great entertainment system. Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service. Turkish are still allowing two free checked bags for economy passengers. I would say Turkish service is on par or even slightly better than Lufthansa but at a much better price. WI-FI is available for a price but didn't use it. Charging ports present for each seat. Will definitely fly again.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Bangkok. Chaotic Boarding at Ataturk Airport. The boarding pass showed a boarding group but everyone was boarding at the same time/no group boarding handled by TK ground staff. Flight 100% full with first generation of Boeing 777-300ER cabin a bit of age but with 3-3-3 seating in Y class, seat 48 cm. wide and very comfortable with good leg room. Cabin crew very organized and professional., they ran the first service aperitif with peanut and drinks and handed over the meal menu to passengers follow by the tasty late supper (2 choice) service. Meal was tasty with full choice of drinks incl. wine beer and other alcoholic beverage. After meal service before turn off the lighting cabin crews provided 1 bottle of water to every passenger. Older IFE on this flight with less choices of games and movies which unfortunately not translated in exotic languages. During the night flight cabin crew came with drinks or ice cream. 2 Hours before landing we were woken up with tasty breakfast and warm rolls and croissant. All in all no negative claim - TK offers top Y class product. I was very satisfied and had a beautiful trip HAM-IST-BKK on TK. Attractive price, flight on time, cabin crew very attentive and excellent inflight service.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didnâ€™t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless. If you can opt for another European Airline instead of THY, please do so.',\n",

I was a bit worried because I had to transfer in Istanbul from IST to SAW but it worked perfectly. 90 min after landing I was at the other airport. However, it was Sunday afternoon, so there was less traffic than during the week. Only two minuses were baggage delivery at IST - the monitors are not updated regularly or are too small for such a big number of arrivals so our baggage was already out and we still did not see information about the belt and the staff at the SAW airport. I had the feeling that there we were punished for flying with Turkish as the airport is hub for the competition airline. Boarding was not even announced properly, just somebody shouted. On the return flight stop over in IST was very pleasant with smooth security control. In flight service great, friendly staff, good food. The only minus is big difference in equipment. I changed 4 planes. 2 were without IFE, one with old one and one with new one. So you never really know what is waiting for you.',\n",

Itâ€™s over a month on and Turkish Airlines customer service had been shockingly poor. The airline is awful, I would avoid! The plane itself was of poor quality.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Munich via Istanbul. Do not fly with Turkish Airlines, especially if you fly coach. The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don\\'t call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5\\'11\" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5\\'4\" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston, but because of the time difference, it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number, +90 212 444 08 492, and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved, but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that, she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats, I approved releasing the seats - and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone. She did rebook us in three seats together, but the thought of sitting in those horribly cramped seats is something all three of us are I gave a 1 point overall rating because this page required a rating. Otherwise, I would have not have given any points!',\n",

We had 1 hour and 45 mins delay from Antalya to Istanbul causing us to miss our connecting flight to London. We had not missed the flight completely but as we got to the gate the airport security said they cannot let us board the plane as Turkish Airlines have stop anyone from boarding 15 mins prior to take off. I spoke to the management in Antalya in regards to a possibility of missing our connection flight at the rate the delay was going. The staff was so calm and collective to say its all fine, you will be on the flight without issue. Bear in mind, hardly any of Turkish airlines staff on ground level can speak fluent English!. I wasn't to assured by his statement. No one in the Airport was helpful and wished to direct or instruct us in what can be done etc. These guys have no customer service or communication skills whatsoever. Just for a few mins of lack of management caused me and my family to wait another 12 hours for the next flight with no consideration about children at all. We was sent to hotel very late to get 2 hours rest with no food or drink and to top it off no luggage with us. Turkish airlines also lost my baby stroller which did not come out of with our baggage so I have had to fill out a form which mentioned someone will be in touch in 24-48 hours and no calls whatsoever and its been 6 days.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | On a recent â€˜round-tripâ€™ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didnâ€™t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. Iâ€™m a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this wonâ€™t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new. In flight entertainment is typically pretty good.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through. This is easily the worst travel experience of my life yet.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | The ground staff were very nice and polite. However, the flight was slightly delayed and for 35 wheelchair passengers there were only 5 people to push them, slowing the boarding process even more at Pearson. The lines were chaos during boarding at Pearson. People did not even stay in systematic lines and they were just \"hogging\" to board like a crowd and the ground staff didn\\'t do anything about it. But thankfully they could announce star alliance gold and business passengers first. At least I could get a lot of space to put my bag. The inflight service was excellent. Excellent selection of movies for a 10 hour flight to Istanbul, delicious and well-presented food, clean bathrooms and prompt staff. When my inflight entertainment system froze during the flight, a flight crew promptly responded and fixed it. Same with when I asked for tea mid-flight. However, the wifi was really bad, it didn\\'t work at all. The cabin crew were very friendly. The same applies with the connecting inflight service till Mumbai. However, the boarding was a lot better at Istanbul, as we could thankfully board from the aerobridge than the bus. Overall, I enjoyed the experience on Turkish Airlines and would love to fly with them again.',\n",

However, over the years they have just become horrible. I was flying from Dusseldorf to Mumbai, they cancelled the first leg of my ticket from Dusseldorf to Istanbul without my consent or without informing me. I spent 9 hours and heaven knows how much money in calling up their customer service before the day of the journey in getting this sorted and getting the ticket re-issued. The in-flight services were very poor, poor in-flight entertainment, cabin crew was rude and food was awful (on one of my 4 flights they served only meal which was non-veg and insisted that one has to pre-book \"special meals\"). Any international flight has and should have at least two choices of meals - veg and non-veg. I am surprised how fast this airline has deteriorated after being a great one for a few years. Never again. Beware folks.',\n",

If the passenger in front of you recline his/her seat, you can't use the tray in front of you. The space is too cramped. The bathrooms are filthy after a few hours and it is not really the flight attendants job to clean the bathrooms while serving the food with the same gloves. The flights from Istanbul to Tehran in both directions were terrible. The flight attendants were condescending to the fellow passengers. It wasn't just this trip. It is also the only airline flying to US has the longest immigration checkpoints before boarding the plane. 3 people checks your passport and 1 checks your carry-on. Everyone gets checked.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I recently flew Turkish Airlines (to/from South Africa via Istanbul), and upon boarding my return flight Johannesburg to Houston via Istanbul and due to their gate security not recognizing my paperwork, I was denied entry onto my flight. Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, â€œthere is a phone and computer, google your help.â€\\x9d I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person. I am sorry Turkish Airlines, even though the flight experience was decent, with edible food, drink and entertainment, the manner in which you treated me is beyond appalling.',\n",

I went to the transfer desk for Turkish Airline. The lady said he will get me fixed on the next flight that leaves in three hours. She said I should wait while she gets a new boarding pass. I waited and waited. Followed up 5 times. Each time I was told not to worry and its being done. After 3 hours - a gentleman from Turkish Airways told me that it was my fault that I missed the connection. 1 hour was more than enough to get the connection. I explained to him the reasons but he said still fault is mine! I asked him if this is what the case is than why I was made to wait for 3 hours? He had no answer to that and stopped talking to me. he said he can give me next day flight and refused to answer me further. He refused to pay for my visa and hotel as well.',\n",

The worst part is that in Istanbul, they put the arriving on a passengers on a slow bus instead of a tarmac to reach the gate and makes it easy to miss the connecting flights. After missing the connection, we had to spend about another 90 minutes at the customer service desk to get on the flight the next day. Turkish Airlines did pay for the hotel stay as well as dinner and breakfast, but it was still an inconvenience. Then, on the flight the next day, there was yet another delay due to mechanical errors. Unbelievable how unpleasant this flight was.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some donâ€™t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600â‚¬ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didnâ€™t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just donâ€™t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They donâ€™t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They donâ€™t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, thatâ€™s just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldnâ€™t be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected, I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again. Worst airline I have ever taken!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Beijing to Istanbul. TK uses a third party to handle their ground formalities in Beijing and need to be aware of the terribly rude and substandard service by check-in and gate agents. My check-in was processed by an agent who was abrupt and surly who conversed with a colleague throughout the check-in process. At the gate we were told there was a 30 minute delay although none of the monitors showed it. As with most departures in China boarding was chaotic with priority lanes being used by all passengers. The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airlineâ€™s fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading. For instance the captain referred to de-icing being completed in 5 minutesâ€™ time when no de-icing equipment were in sight. Overall it was a mediocre to OK flight.',\n",

Another male air hostess was consistently rude to female staff members, and to my wife. On several occasions he asked me (a man sitting in a middle seat) if I wanted a drink, but ignored my wife who was sitting next to me on an aisle seat.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Tehran via Istanbul. I had one of my worst experience (if not the worst) with Turkish Airlines. I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with. The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing. My experience couldn't be worse.\",\n",

Flight from Madrid was delayed by 5 hours (flew 11.30 pm instead of 6.15 pm) since it was not possible to catch my connection flight they booked me the next trip 12.55 pm (an extra night and almost 9 hours transit time). Arrived into Istanbul and my baby was extremely tired, asked Turkish information desk for a place to spend the night but a rude employee told me go to the public restrooms. They were extremely uncomfortable so I went back and asked again, this time they gave me 5 hours lounge stay where again it was impossible to sleep. Overall a horrible nightmare experience. Rude employees who don't have any ideas on how to satisfy a customer.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Bangkok to Houston via Istanbul. After avoiding them for a few years I decided to try them again, though if I had read the reviews here I would not have. Same experience, impressive website not quite working. I booked my ticket entering my United FF number noticing it kept adding the TK airline code. Then I saw they offered chauffeur driven service for pick up and drop off. I could only get to it after logging into my TK miles & smiles account. After lengthy email exchange I was told my one way business class ticket for > 2,000 $ was too cheap for this that is still ok but very low. I noticed my record showed my TK ff number, which I do not use as I collect bonus miles on UA. So on Checking in BKK I verified they had my US number they confirmed and even read it back to me. In ISt I noticed my TK account has miles deposited so I emailed, no reply. : After arrival I again noticed TK had deposited the miles obviously I lost all my gold bonus.: So I called TK - what a nightmare to even find a phone number and a person. They were initial quite abrupt and unwilling to help. A few days later I blunt rejection letter there was nothing they could do My response.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Tel Aviv via Istanbul was on time, as were 4 segments of my itinerary. Cabin staff solicitous ,helpful and polite. Catering out of JFK was particularly good, the onboard \"chefs\" a nice touch even if they really aren\\'t preparing much fresh food. We were seated on the side, 2 abreast, which was good as the center section of 3 across does not look appealing. The seats are relatively open, not affording much privacy, but the amount of storage is more than very sufficient, and the seat comfort when in the flat position, including the \"bedpad\", comforter and pillow more than adequate. The lounge in Istanbul was quite good, being on two levels with many interesting and well prepared food stations. We were also given two private sleeping rooms in the lounge for our 5 hour transit, a very nice touch. All in all, Turkish seems to offer a solid business class product, superior to US airlines in staff attitude, on time performance, speed of baggage delivery and overall efficiency.',\n",

The business seats are side by side lie flats and not the more modern individual spaces found on most long-haul airlines. So, privacy is an issue. The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling. They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked? This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer.',\n",

Especially male crew on both flights, they were very friendly and willing to do everything as perfect as possible. Heard them speaking with other customers with good English skills. Entertainment with lots of choice. Very comfortable seats which can be changed to a bed with one button or to different positions and I slept well on the long flights. The lounge in Istanbul is amazing and also The Eva Air lounge in Bangkok that Turkish Airlines passengers can use was very classy. I enjoyed eating in both of them. Overall I can recommend Turkish Airlines Business class. It was a pleasure. The only small minus was on the Turkey legs I didn't feel acknowledged during boarding being a business class passenger.\",\n",

The crew could also learn a bit more English and be a bit friendlier overall. IST-KUL was on a Boeing 777 and certainly more comfortable. The crew was more present, is TK a hit or miss?

Fortunately, some of the medications, which my husband had in his possession, were couriered to me from New York. To cut a long story short, finally after my bag reached its destination, instead of the airline delivering the bag, I had to collect it from La Guardia airport.

I have no clothes for 8 days and Turkish Airlines are refusing even to compensate me for the lost bag. 2) When we changed our travel date due to a medical emergency supported by a letter from the hospital, Turkish Airlines charged me and my wife 1200 extra dollars per ticket and refused to waive any fees due to the medical emergency like all other reputable airlines. 3) On a number of occasions I missed my connections due to late arrival to Istanbul (on Turkish Airlines) and Turkish Airlines refused to take any resposibility for missing my meetings by flying me on a different airlines flight.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston. Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable. The staff are rude and inhumane, Ataturk airport is chaotic and Turkish Airlines does not care about its passengers regardless of if you're flying business class or economy.\",\n",

Very poor staff interaction, in both the aircraft and Istanbul airport, itâ€™s quite unenjoyable to be in such hostile environment. If you want to have proper communication with the staff, you better learn Turkish. I does appear that Turkish Airlines employees are not getting paid enough to treat people with respect.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx Â£120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx Â£230 for my extra bag. Â£110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price? Shame on them.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Guangzhou. One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning. Kind of baffled I inquired a few times again but somehow this multi-billion company kept insisting that breaching the contract with their customers was business as usual for them. Can't really do anything else then to warn as many people as possible not to trust this airline.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The first time I flew with Turkish Airlines and it was a disappointment. My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane. In conclusion, this was really a bad experience.\",\n",

Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags. Avoid Turkish connecting flights if you cann!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | We (me and my two kids - 7 and 6 years old) travelled to Malta for a holiday. I was very impressed with the on board product, nice seats with reasonable legroom, very friendly staff, excellent food and also excellent in-flight entertainment. The kids received toys from the stewardess (on both flights) and were happy the entire time. Connecting in Istanbul was OK, very crowded and gate logistics not very efficient, but understandable due to the small terminal from where we were shuttled to the plane with a bus. We did not check our bags and the staff were vocal on giving priority to overhead compartment for larger bags which suited us perfectly, this is something other airlines should think of. All in all a very pleasant trip with both departures on time and a solid performance of the airline. We will certainly choose Turkish for our next trip if possible.',\n",

Time for a visit to the modest SAS Lounge (being Star Gold status) where there was a selection of light bites and drinks perfectly adequate for a pre-flight snack. Orderly boarding with priority boarding well handled. Inside the aircraft I first noticed the small size of the individual seat-back screens. But obviously airlines canâ€™t just throw them all away when bigger and better ones come along. Hot meal served in flight - with a choice of two entrees and various drinks. Delay landing in Istanbul due to congestion - hopefully a thing of the past when the new airport opens. Bus to the terminal. Long queue for the Biz class immigration desk. To the right of it is a channel serving a continual line of Turkish Airlines crew. I donâ€™t understand why the crew dont use the two adjacent but always empty Beogs electronic immigration gates, hence freeing up a second line for the high revenue fare paying passengers. Even after the queue there was a wait for the luggage to come up. Overall a good flight and thanks to the fare I found online, extremely good value.

Itâ€™s a shame that Turkish Airlines use the Bidvest lounge at CPT because itâ€™s one of those pay-to-enter places thatâ€™s stuffed with passengers gorging themselves with food. Boarding for the CPT â€“ IST flight started an hour before take-off, which seemed excessive. The business class cabin has a utilitarian dÃ©cor of shades of grey â€“ no middle-eastern bling or graduated, coloured lighting here. The staggered 2:2:2 seating pattern affords reasonable privacy, although passengers in window seats still have to climb over their neighbourâ€™s legs.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good! Disembarkation at CPT was quick, immigration was a breeze and we collected our bags just 10 minutes after landing. Overall, we were impressed and we're actually looking forward to our return flights.\",\n",

I had to phone several times (sometimes with long waits and difficult communication in English)) to reserve seats in a business class. Fully flat bed seats were comfortable but food service was disorganized. Very pleasant staff was running back and forth with individual dishes and glasses in very inefficient fashion. The major problem for us occurred in the Istanbul business class lounge. Our wait time between the flights was 10 hours, and we expected to be able to use their sleeping rooms for at least several hours. To our surprise we were informed that we are not eligible because the rule is that only customers with a wait time 3-7 hours are eligible! We pleaded to let us stay for a shortened period to no avail. After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked. So we spent next 10 hours in a noisy crowded business lounge, with tables and floors overflowing with dirty dishes, cutlery, napkins and empty bottles and cans.',\n",

However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world). I gave only 3 for seat comfort but it must be said that it is always painful for me to travel on airline seats.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | 15 Dec, Chicago - Istanbul, Turkish Airlines business class. Check-in was very quick at ORD airport with kind and very polite agent. Boarding was in order and a separate boarding line for Business class and Elite members. On board was greeted with a warm welcome. Pre takeoff had a glass of Champagne which was perfectly chilled and really enjoyed. Push back was on time. Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course. Had ordered special meal AVML (Asian vegetarian meal). I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from. The only complaint I have is, that they do not come and ask or refill the drink you are enjoying. I suggest they should improve this. Again I will be flying on TK business class end of March this year.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Montreal. Everyone was boarding at the same time (No grouping, no priority), and as the plane was full boarding took quite some time. Plane was new (3 years old) and had 2-4-2 layout. Seat itself was okay, comparable to other long-haul flights I've taken. Legroom was good, I'm 6 foot and I had no problems. Food and drink service was amazing, we were first handed packs of peanut followed by a drink service, then dinner. The food was really good, and was filling for one person. Drinks were provided throughout the flight. IFE was good, and there were plenty of films and series. One complaint is that there were some random episodes of some TV Series (like Season 4 Episode 5-6-7 of a series). Crew was helpful and unlike other Turkish Airlines flights I've taken, they were able to have an actual conversation in English. I bought in flight WiFi (for 14.99$US) and it worked well throughout the flight.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Napoli to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The worst experience ever. Two hours flight delayed missing connection flight to Perth. Stuck in the airport for more than 30hr. I took with my partner on the 17 January 2018 at 19:00 a Turkish airline flight from Napoli to Perth with connection flight in Istanbul and Kuala Lumpur. The flight left the city of Napoli 30 min late. Once we landed in Istanbul me and my partner quickly went to check the connection flight time which was also affected by 30 min delay. Once onboard of the flight TK60 of 18 Jan 2018 at 2:25 the plane was not full of passenger yet. At 2:35 the captain announced that we had to wait 15 min for more passenger to arrive that then turned into 45 minutes. We end up leaving at 3:45 and due to this late departure we also had to wait for seven planes to take off before us. On board me and my partner have been asking several times to the staff for the connection flight from Kuala Lumpur but all the cabin crews including the manager seems to donâ€™t know much about the situation and didnâ€™t really care. On late arrival in KL at 18:30 we miss our connecting flight with Malindo airline and ground staff told us we were on next morning flight and that hotel and transports have been arranged. The next day we went back to the airport at 5:30am just to find out that we were not on the flight at 8:45 am and the staff of Malindo knew nothing of our situation. We have been stuck here in the airport ever since to wait for a Turkish airline representative.',\n",

I cannot find words to describe their \"customer service\" and should anything go wrong during the trip you are left alone. Between booking and flying, TK changed the aircraft type and a flight time without informing me at all. I flew from LHR to IST and then my flight from IST to SKG was cancelled. It took me 2.5 hours at the transfer desk and stories I cannot even describe to get a ticket to return back to London as there was no other flight to my destination until the day after. I had a business class ticket, however when I went to the gate I was told they had overbooked the business class cabin and I would have to be downgraded to economy. Overall, I spent 34 hours without sleep only to return where I left from, without ever reaching my destination. And now several days later, I still haven\\'t received a refund for my tickets.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | My family and I flew from Washington via Islamabad and return from Karachi - Istanbul - Washington in December on Turkish Airlines and couldn't have been more pleased. The flights were on time, inflight catering was excellent, the leg space in economy has slightly improved, the English proficiency of the crew has greatly improved, and the inflight entertainment has vastly improved and is easy to use. The service of the crew was excellent. My mother in law who was traveling with us can only consume liquids and requested if she could could get some milk to drink. Instead the crew brought her soup from business class and then came back a little bit later with some more. Truly above and beyond service on their part. The only thing though is the USB ports did not fully work in all of the seats which was annoying, and I wish they did not do away with the delicious Turkish food which used to be served. But all in all Turkish Airlines is worth every penny, and I do not regret choosing them back in 2007 as my international airline of choice.\",\n",

As the carry on exceeded the 8 kilos permitted cabin weight, I paid the extra fee and checked in the carry on as well. However, when landed in Tehran, I realized that the carry on's tagging number was not even issued at the boarding desk and my carry on was lost. I filled in the application form at lost and found office in Tehran and have called the Turkish airlines at Munich airport several times so far, but after 10 days still haven't received any answer. As I do not even have a baggage tag number for my carry on, I cannot even claim for compensation. What I am wondering is, even if the check-in clerk forgets to hand over the baggage tag, why can't they try to check what was the number of the checked in carry-on as all the information are recorded and kept in the system. I am extremely disappointed as this has kind of ruined my holiday.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | It was my first time flying Turkish Airlines from Geneva to Jakarta via Istanbul. I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff donâ€™t even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it. The seat was acceptable, and the entertainment system good (some other airlines have more choices, but it was good enough for me), I liked the controlller than can be used as a screen, and the headsets. I could have taken Emirates for $500 more.',\n",

Our transit time at IST was around 14 hrs. When approached the service counter at Istanbul they gave us only one snack (one slice of pizza for each passenger) voucher. I asked her where to stay for full day transit. She said anywhere at the airport and went back to her mobile phone chat. In between, she was chatting with a male colleague and didn't seem to have time to pay attention to customer. She worked more like a machine than a human in only giving vouchers with out speaking to customers. Upon complaint they tried to cover its inefficiency and poor service by saying that â€œNo request can be traced at their hotel desk on ISTâ€\\x9d. How will there be a record if TK staff misleads the customers away. Nobody (TK ticket sales office at Lahore airport) had informed us the time of ticketing to request a hotel in advance during transit at IST. TK said that we didn't request a hotel.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Mombasa to London Gatwick via Istanbul. Our flight from Mombasa was meant to depart at 4.30am. I checked in at 2.30, the flight did not leave till 6 am. Hence arrived Istanbul late and only to find out my bags did not arrive in Gatwick. On putting in the claim I was told I would get my bags the following day, again only to call and find out only 1 bag arrived and the other bag is still in Mombasa. This is the first time I have travelled with Turkish Airlines and have had the worst experience. I suggest that you rather pay an extra 100 dollars and go for a better airline. Lousy service and pathetic airline.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight. The service and cabin staff were excellent, even on the old A330!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight. If they decided to add WiFi on all aircraft, it might really annoy the competition.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Flew business class, TK35 Istanbul to Montreal on Dec 08 2017. I must emphasize the amazing lounge in Istanbul. No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isnâ€™t Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lotâ€™s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly. Not so on Turkish!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Kayseri to Istanbul. I cannot recommend this airline. After being unable to fly to Turkey due to recent US Visa restrictions, I called the company. Was told to call back two weeks later which I did and then I was told to call back again. I did. Then I was told that I must get a refund at a Turkish Airlines sales office, there are only 2 in the entire US. I complained and was told to call back. Now I am told that I can get a \"refund\" after cancellation and \"no-show\" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket. Apparently, they are only granting full refunds if you depart from the US. This is an absolute sham and seems set up to make the system frustrating to navigate so they can mitigate their losses. They don\\'t seem to care.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada. It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: â€œReissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didnâ€™t see was the fine print at the bottom: â€œTurkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.â€\\x9d. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered â€œI canâ€™t accept thisâ€\\x9d. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day. Turkish Airlines is different. This is truly a horrible company with mean spirited employees.\",\n",

I had a layover of 19 hours so we were suppose to get hotel, but because of being American passport we didn't get hotel. I didn't mind getting hotel but they gave me lot of trouble just to give little information about the visa. I was wondering from one counter to another counter just to get right information. Staffs at the airport were the rudest people I ever met. Even the visa officers at the counter didn't give me correct information instead they yelled and behaved in a very rude way. I couldn't get hotel because I and my kids had American passport and they don't issue visa from the airport to the American. My question to the Turkish Airlines is that why they didn't mention that while I brought the ticket why they issued ticket to the American passport? I went to Turkish Airlines counter may be four time finally I got the correct answer. Staffs at the Turkish Airlines counter were also very very rude just as other staff at the airport. I ended up paying 300$ at airport hotel. I will never travel with Turkish Airlines again.\",\n",

On the homebound flight from Antalya to Jakarta via Istanbul my TK 2425 (30 Nov 2017) was delayed without any announcement. On boarding I asked the ground crew if I would still be able to catch my Istanbul-Jakarta flight (TK56), and the ground crew replied that \"no problem\". The plane landed late and I missed my flight to Jakarta. Yes, Turkish airline did give me a hotel, yes, Turkish airline did give me a ticket rebooking, yes Turkish airline did give me breakfast-lunch-dinner. However, I did not receive my luggage and hence I did not have any change of clothes. Upon seeing the queue at the Turkish Airlines hotel transfer I was in a dilemma of either waiting another 2 hours before getting my luggage at 4am or go sleep at the hotel and not have my luggage. In my luggage was also my laptop charger and mobile charger which I would have needed to inform work, arrangements that I will be delayed by one day. But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed. I was appalled by the ground crew at Antalya airport who lied to my face, and the ground crew at the hotel transfer who did not sympathize that I needed my luggage and only offered strict options. I was very dissapointed that Turkish airline did not provide me a letter of delay to help me justify my situation at my home country, and no laundry service hence I was not in fresh clothes for more than 48hrs! It is easy providing hotels, food and ticket change but please keep in mind that all these passengers are humans and have lives and dependencies and have specific needs and requirements.',\n",

Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care. It's a shame, since their planes and prices are very nice, the headache in dealing with the problems afterwards is just too much to fly with them again.\",\n",

I'am generally use Turkish Airlines and first time this is the first time I see more than one managing problem during check-in and flight. Check-in attendants was much more slower than my other trips and they gives people wrong information. They have no idea about seat layout of aircraft and nobody don't accept and try to solve any kind of problem. During flight, you can feel the differences between cabin crew, Turkish Airlines don't educate their new flight attendant like they used to. I hope these problems will be short term and Turkish Airlines back to their old days.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Took advantage of promotional fares on Turkish Airlinesâ€™ new route (when I booked) from Istanbul to Phuket. When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldnâ€™t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open. After check-in, Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour. At boarding time we were escorted to the gate and given immediate boarding. Before take-off given menus and was asked to complete my breakfast choices. After take-off breakfast was served. I had ordered scrambled eggs but when they reached me in row Four, they said they had all gone. They offered an omelette or waffles',\n",

On both flights, cabin and toilets were clean and staff were nice. Food was in big portion and we are pleased to have it. Inflight amenities were sufficient. During this flight we did not get ice cream like Asian airlines. My other inputs are that menu for flights from Istanbul. Please serve any other menu from elsewhere. We had enough Turkish meal during our long visit in Turkey and please train your staff to speak better English. Yes they are nice and polite and speak English but just a little effort to speak better and I am sure Turkish airlines can do it.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to New York with Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively painless considering it was at a very early hour of the morning. Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue. The wifi worked well and the IFE had a decent selection although it could have used more recent movie releases. Flight departed and arrived on time and was a good experience overall.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | London - Istanbul - Mashad in August and returned in September in economy. Three of us took the flights, planes were dated but they were clean and entertainment provided on board. Due to code sharing their flights were full to the limit. Lunch and dinner very good, however we did not like the breakfast. Mashhad to Istanbul delayed and as a result of this and due to very unhelpful airport staff (not Turkish Airlines) we missed our connecting flight and had to board the next flight, arriving in London 5 hours later than originally planned. Our bags delayed by about 5 days. All this to the side, Turkish Airlines processed our claim within 7 days, I had to only send a single email and full compensation was paid. Cabin crew were fantastic and ready to help. What I am most impressed with is their claim department that processed our claim very fast and paid full compensation. Well done to them and cabin crews.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore via Istanbul. FRA-IST then 2.5h layover and IST-SIN. The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn\\'t arrive in Singapore. It\\'s missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline\\'s website claims \"Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents.\". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it\\'s 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It\\'s as bad a website as I\\'ve ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn\\'t state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like \"On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use â€œold versionâ€\\x9d or â€œnew versionâ€\\x9d I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of â€“ why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesnâ€™t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, thereâ€™s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to London. My comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself. There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.\",\n",

Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly. One crew member kept bringing me tea (without my asking) while I worked for about six hours. She always had a pleasant smile throughout the trip. I wrote this review to ensure that the crew's effort did not go unnoticed.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | London to Manila return via Istanbul. Check in was very quick we checked in 3 large suitcases with our 80kgs combined allowance we also had two carry on trolley cases a rucksack and suit holder asked if we could check in the rucksack to save dragging it around with us even though we were on the check in limit, yes sir no problem. Spent time in the business class lounge to wait for boarding. Arrived at the boarding gate checked through boarded the plane first. Flight London to Istanbul was 4 hours approx, seat was very comfortable flight attendants very good and spoke perfect English. There was a chef who came round and took our order for our meal. The food was excellent. IFE was good but not great could do with upgrading but acceptable. We arrived in Istanbul on time and were bussed to the terminal business class passengers were off the plane first and had there own bus. we had about two hours. so spent time in the Turkish Airlines Lounge then headed to our gate to board our plane for Manila. this is the only fault I found with this trip. There was no business class priority boarding just everybody trying to to get through the check in and only one member of staff checking tickets and passports absolutely ridiculous it was mayhem finally got through the check in and were last to board a waiting bus (I would not have liked to be first on the bus) to take us to the aircraft. We were welcomed on board by the flight attendants and given a pre flight drink and our suit holder was hung up for us. The seats were comfortable and spacious and turned into a flatbed with the ottoman at the foot and for once I actually slept during the flight which is a rarity for me. The IFE was the same as mentioned before Our section of the business cabin had 28 seats which less than half were occupied. Flight attendants were very attentive spoke perfect English. The chef came round asked to fill out a menu card for our breakfast at the end of our flight and also took our order for our meal again it was a fantastic meal the best we have had in the air. We were a little late taking off from Istanbul for our 12 hour flight but still arrived at Manila 1 hour early. We were first off the plane through immigration got to the carousel to pick our luggage our 4 bags because of the priority tags were in the first 10 bags we were out of Manila airport 25 minutes after getting off the plane. Our return trip was just as good if not better as the boarding situation for the London flight at Istanbul was much better organised. Would I use this airline again, most definitely.',\n",

She spent 8 hours in the airport, from 7pm till 3am, was inside the plane for 1,5 hour and then got kicked out with everyone else. No one offered any complementary food, water wasnâ€™t given. Somehow at 3:30 am they provided the hotel, but she had to share it with the other 2 passengers not related to each other. The transport wasnâ€™t provided, so she had to pay for taxi from her own. By 11 am the hotel told them to check out. She left hotel and took taxi back to the airport. Only business class was take care of. We spent another 5 hours in the airport waiting for some news. At 5 pm they opened check in for another flight. After all this long upsetting time the new flight got delayed again! For another 1,5 hours. I'm not sure if they rebooked her for next flight from Istanbul to Odessa, I hope there it will be okay. The company doesnâ€™t care about customers at all, will definitely never use it again\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Quick check-in and boarding. The hard product is comfortable but lacks privacy due to 2x2x2 configuration of the business class cabin which means no direct aisle access for all seats. The FA's were pleasant and professional although their English was not very good. Food quality was average and below their historical standards. Toilets were kept reasonably clean and tidy throughout the journey. IFE had many choices but list of films needed an update with very few recent releases. Flight left on time and arrived a full hour ahead of schedule. The disembarkation via buses remains a total nuisance and mystery as there were plenty of vacant air bridges. Overall a decent experience but the business class product is inferior to the Gulf and Southeast Asian carriers.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively quick and efficient. Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route. This was despite vacant air bridges. Overall it was a good experience but TK has to reverse the downward trend in their catering quality and return to the high standards they used to have.\",\n",

Though full, it was on time and all procedures, check in and boarding were performed swiftly. The cabin was nice though no individual screens, just overheards for safety demonstrations and maps, along with a few commercials. Very professional crew, elegant and efficient and amazingly cheerful, captain announcements was very pleasant. Although planned for 1h 45 duration, the flight lasted a short 1h20 minutes. During this time, economy service was performed with tea, coffee, juices served in elegant paper cups along with hot salty pastries. Excellent landing. Very pleasant.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce. We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly?',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Cluj-Napoca to Singapore via Istanbul and it was one of the best flight experiences so far. You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight. All in all, very happy with the airline, their call center (which I used to reserve my seats) and would gladly fly with them again. .\",\n",

So because there were no more flights that day going to Ukraine, we had to stay overnight in Istanbul. It was a nightmare waiting to be placed in a hotel. I had no extra diapers or baby food. On top we had to pay for 3 visas to stay in Istanbul (total $90). We were told that we will get reimbursed for visas, so upon our return I started requesting reimbursement. We were granted our reimbursement, however to get your money you have to go to their \"closest sales office\" - well guess what, for me it is a 2 hour drive! They refused to mail a check for deposit, so now i am out $90 and had a terrible flight all because of no fault of mine. This is unacceptable in this day and age to make someone drive for 2 hours to get $ they are entitled to. Will never use this airline again.',\n",

As we got to the boarding gate, we wanted to get the rest of our family onto business class. There were seats available, but the first person we asked said it was impossible to change seats at such a late time. I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class.

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldnâ€™t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Istanbul. Food service was poor. They run out of dinner with fish after serving almost 50 passengers and I had no other option but pasta with cheese sauce. My return on Sept 19 2017 was terrible. A woman was changing her baby's diaper by the food service area. Flight attendant was incapable of doing something about it. During dinner time they once again run out and I was served this time eggplant with rice. By the time they service our section my food was cold. I gave my dinner back. When I told the flight attendant she said 'she will let her supervisor know' but nobody came to talk to me nor offered anything else to eat. I believe I had to get upset like other passengers to receive better dinner and service. I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for 15 years and have lost confidence for the quality service and competency of keeping passengers satisfaction.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Istanbul. Check in and boarding were smooth. Onboard, the aircraft interior looked worn, the air was stale and sticky. The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapÃ©s, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley. Toilets were kept in reasonably good state throughout the flight. The wifi was good and operated without interruption. The flight left late but landed on schedule. Overall it was a decent experience but the decline in catering quality was very obvious.\",\n",

Personal entertainment system was not functioning. The biggest problem was that my seat did not fix in upright position, which was making both me and the passenger behind very uncomfortable. I felt like plane must be 20 years+ old just to find out it is ex Jet Airways (India) plane, only 8.5 years old.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Really impressed with the hard products and 9 abreast seats in B777 economy. Even more impressed with the live television services, though limited channels. I would not have imagined watching a UEFA Champions League / World Cup qualifier game whilst travelling intercontinental. Food is good relative to other airlines. Was relieved that my check-in luggage made it through to Kuala Lumpur, after there was a 50 minutes delay from my departure at Heathrow. At Istanbul, I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate. Made it into the connection to Kuala Lumpur, but was resigned that my luggage wouldn't make it and may come in on the following flight. Thankfully, it reached KUL together with me. One reservation about the hardproduct is seat pitch, especially on the A330. I'm 6 foot 1, and really feel the tightness. Not much improvement on the B777, but perhaps bearable for a 9 hours flight.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | London to Riyadh via Istanbul. I booked a seat by the window on the right-hand side. The flight left at 01:20 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Hong Kong - Istanbul - Copenhagen on B777-300 and A321, respectively. Flew 5+6 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FAâ€™s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (â€œDevonâ€\\x9d). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze â€“ I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles. Only 6 seats were occupied (out of 20) on this morning flight. IFE also good.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Buenos Aires to Barcelona via Istanbul. Seats are ok, but not the best. The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board. If they did, they would be quite perfect.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | For my vacation to Turkey I decided to fly with Turkish Airlines instead of a charter airline like SmartWings. We boarded an A321-200 in Prague, seats were really nice with really good pitch and each seat has personal IFE which is geat for a 2 hours flight. The headphones were not very good, but thats ok. Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again. The A321 was really nice and IFE for 2 hours flight is great, it is just the crew that could be little bit better.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Brussels via Istanbul. Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more. No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid. When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright. We just did not understand why on a night flight it took so long to get your meal after the take off. It would be nice to get it earlier and then get some more time to sleep.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Flying Turkish Airlines is always a good if not great experience regardless of what class you are flying. But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city. Bottom line, best customer service I have ever had. Keep doing what you are doing Turkish Airlines!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to \"write me up\" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service. I was disappointed by this attitude and treatment.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Flew Dalaman to Istanbul Ataturk. Found the Business Class check-in tucked away in the corner of a seething departure hall. Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted! We were taken by bus to the domestic terminal and all in all 30 minutes delay. I have not had a delayed Turkish Airlines flight for months so not a big deal for me.',\n",

We pointed out that we only have two small carry-on bags and all we need is a boarding pass (and we still had 50 minutes to departure). He refused with a smirk adding that that's not his problem. We ended up spending thousands of Euros for our new tickets, paying for a hotel, and changing the schedule of our trip and all of it was unnecessary.

The check in was efficient and fast, there was a special clearance lane for Turkish Airlines passengers (different to the normal fast track for other airlines and this lane fed straight into the lounge). The plane was a little late taking off and there seemed to be no hurry with the meal service, a pity as I would rather have slept straight away and just had breakfast. The food and wine on the plane was good. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. There was a priority lane service but not used as there was no queue in Immigration.My luggage was the first off - there has been a problem where two or more sectors are flown but not on this occasion.

Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue. Felt much more comfortable on the 10+ hour Istanbul to Boston leg with my back-pack stored above me rather than under the seat in front of me. Also got a great price by ordering the ticket 4+ months in advance, though did have to pay extra for flight insurance.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to London via Istanbul. First leg from Bangkok was an A330. Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR. The process of getting PED's was almost as cumbersome as getting them checked in but TK staff did their best to return devices as quickly as possible.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Beijing to Atlanta via Istanbul. The flight itself was very good. My issue is with the mediocre to bad service outside of the flight. I purchased an economy ticket and tried to use my miles (from another airline within Star Alliance) to upgrade one segment of the flight. Simple? Not at all. I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes. Then I upgraded the ticket using my miles, but was then told that the upgrade would change the code to an I. Code I does means that I get no miles for the flight even though I paid full price for the ticket. I tried to contact Turkish Airlines through their website and received no reply. I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me. Then they tried to charge me a reissuing fee for their mistake. Then I tried to upgrade again and couldn't online so I contacted them (this time by phone) and was told that their system was down and they couldn't do anything.\",\n",

The outbound trip from Bahrain to Istanbul came on a date that was critical (28 Jun 2016 and what happened in Istanbul Airport). The airline and airport services worked professionally to cope with the stress around, rescheduling flight cancellations and assigning delayed people to new flights, others have been taken to hotels. I was travelling with my family, everything was arranged smoothly and since we got delayed for the flight of the next morning, we were offered a 5 star hotel accommodation and a Business class upgrade for the connecting flight to Tunis.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul. They charge for sporting equipment stating it's a 'handling fee'. They are happy to take golf bags and skis free of charge, and diving equipment to three destinations free of charge, but the rest of the world they charge for. It really can't be that hard to handle some fins, a mask and a very small speargun for no charge can it, especially when these make up the only form of checked in baggage? And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either. Oh and they don't charge sports baggage fees as a single trip return, they charge for each destination where you stop / layover, both there and back, so you could pay up to 90 euros one way,and the same return.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | London to Guangzhou via Istanbul. I chose Turkish Airline on this occasion instead of my regular Qatar Airways. Was a bit apprehensive choosing this airline but what a fantastic airline it turn out to be, flights were punctual, priority boarding at all sectors, attentive and smiling FAs plus a chef on board preparing food which was very tasty and flatbed seats on both aircraft. The only issue, nothing to do with the airline, is the last leg, Istanbul to London and it can be daunting especially after a 10 hour flight where you go through security checks twice and no laptops on hand baggage. Although flying Business Class, the queues is very much the same as travelling economy and it took forever. Apart from the security checks at IST, everything else was as good if not better than some other 5* airlines I have flown. Give this airline a try and you will be pleasantly surprised.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Gatwick to Bangkok via Istanbul. The arrival experience could be stepped up slightly. There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members. The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board. Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals. I have flown with them a few times and nothing has been on show or shown in the menu.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul. TK1980/TK0064. Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as â€œsalad and steakâ€\\x9d it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less. Overall a good flight, worth recommending if the price point is right.',\n",

Check-in slower than normal for priority lane on account of extra layer of checks for flights bound for North America. Boarding by zone numbers and quite orderly. On board, the hard product was a little weathered with scuff marks and torn trim. The flight left the gate 35 minutes late and there was no reason provided other than \"operational issues\". Once airborne, a 5-course lunch was served along with a wide range of drink choices. The food was quite tasty and well presented. The FA\\'s were warm, friendly and very attentive. A special mention goes out to the staff who looked after my side of the aisle with a permanent smile and cheery demeanour throughout the entire flight. The IFE had a good selection but was awkward to navigate at times. Tolilets needed attention and were not always clean / tidy.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | I was particularly looking forward to TK 1, my first trans-Atlantic business class experience. In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows. If Turkish Airlines can get control of the boarding experience, their business class service would be easily a 10.',\n",

Having had my original flight out of Montreal cancelled and rerouted through Toronto with a 24-hour delay, I was bracing for the worst. Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep. Toilets were kept clean throughout the journey.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Turkish Airlines makes a real effort to give even their economy passengers a positive experience. Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience. My flight back to Turkey and the USA next week will be in business class, so I am looking forward to the award-winning premium service.',\n",

Most cabin crews on Kuala Lumpur - Istanbul sector were nice and polite except one male crew looked grumpy but he still did the job well. Nothing to complain from Istanbul to Venice. Toilet was clean and with proper amenities. We got nice blanket, pillow and nice pouch (Kuala Lumpur - Istanbul sector) full of flying amenities such as lip balm, socks, eye shade, toothbrush and ear plug which are nice. AVOD needs improvement on film and song selection. Need to provide some asian movies and songs including in Chinese/Mandarin. You have ones in Malay but not Bahasa Indonesia although you also serve Jakarta airport. Wifi is on and off. A bit frustrating indeed. Other than that, I have nothing to complain.',\n",

The flight itself was fine - not notably good or bad compared to many other airlines I have been on. My bag was delayed on the connection which was annoying but acceptable for a day, but less ideal when it became a second day with no explanation or contact from Turkish Airlines. But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice\",\n",

In both Amsterdam and Amman as well in transit in Istanbul we could use priority facilities allowing us to skip the lines for security. Turkish Airlines uses the Aspire Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport which was crowded and poorly stocked with food and drink options. In Amman they use the Royal Jordanian lounge which is spacious and well stocked with food and drink. During the 2 layover in Istanbul we used the Turkish Airline lounge which is huge with a lot of amenities and food options and again a good WIFI network. We even found some time to toy around with the Golf simulator on the lower floor of the lounge. The flights were the typical medium haul service, all 4 flights left reasonably in time and arrived spot on time at destination. On the day flights between Amsterdam and Istanbul a lunch respectively breakfast were offered. All the food was tasty and nicely presented. During the night flights between Istanbul and Amman, prior to take-off we were offered diner respectively breakfast but in both cases we opted to sleep which was perfectly possible in the sleeper seats in he A340 and A330. On all 4 flights the cabin staff was well groomed, nice and attentive but always stayed at distance.',\n",

TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew. The French announcements from the cockpit were a nice touch. Flight departed late but arrived 40 minutes ahead of schedule.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'Montreal to Budapest via Istanbul. I had quite high expectations of Turkish Airlines but after four flights with them I evaluate them as mediocre. Perhaps I made a wrong meal selection, but Oriental Vegetarian meal was very unappealing. Other meals were equally dissatisfying. I appreciated steel cutlery instead of plastic. I was also disappointed to see that Turkish provides small vanity bags in an attempt to make the flight more comfortable. I would still recommend Turkish, because I booked with them and the price for a direct flight to Montreal was a good one.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | This almost 11 hour flight happened in a brand-new aircraft. On-board entertainment as well as the seats were just perfect. As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on. By the way, the short flight from Istanbul to Zurich (3 h) in an old aircraft was perfectly organized.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I\\'ve witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the \"angled flat\" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you\\'ll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won\\'t come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I\\'m more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I\\'d fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation. A note of warning - unlike most Turkish long-haul aircraft which offer excellent wifi, this aircraft has no wifi, so you\\'d better enjoy reading.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | London to Izmir via Istanbul. First time Iâ€™d flown TK. I found them very good in the air, cabin crew, planes, food, all very nice. Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff donâ€™t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasnâ€™t an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, Iâ€™d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: \"Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It\\'s okay\". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it\\'s an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay. If you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Flew on Turkish Airlines IAD-IST-KHI and return KHI-IST-IAD. Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice. Overall another wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | The experience with Turkish Airlines has been devastating one. First paid $200 Euros per luggage, totaling $400 Euros for 2 luggage that end up lost between Turkish Airlines and JetBlue. My itinerary was from Venice to Istanbul to Boston and from there with Jetblue to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Once I made it to Boston I looked for my luggage and it never made it to BOS. I immediately try to make a reclamation to Turkish Airlines at BOS and was told that I had to wait until my final destination. Once I made it to my final destination I made my claim. Turkish Airlines will not cooperate with Jetblue and even if JB was really trying to help is not much they could do because TATurkish Airlines did not care for my luggage. It never made to Boston. Turkish Airlines have been unhelpful. In my case, even presenting evidence to both airlines, neither is able to find my lost claim luggage. It seems the claim is a form which after being submitted it get to be submitted evidence, dead word, as they do not even comply with the search of the lost not delivered luggage in hands of Turkish Airlines.',\n",

Turkish Airlines did nothing to help - in fact finding someone with Turkish Airlines to assist is a feat in itself. TA kept passing the blame. Bottom line - if any segment of your Turkish Airlines flights causes a delay then you are SOL when it comes to TA. Plan on spending a lot more money and flying another airline because Turkish Airlines will not assist you and they will keep your money. The \"customer service\" is a joke - they read from scripts and keep repeating the same paragraph - almost like robots. They also tell you to send an email - it is just a stalling tactic.',\n",

I tried to change my flight date, called the airline and they made the changes. Told me I would be getting a confirmation email after I hang up (Never received it). I called back, submitted my request again and was told that someone would get back to me in at most 7 days (Never happened again). I called back (this was 3 days to the actual flight date), was told I need to go to a Airline office to make a change!. The closest office to me is 250 miles away. Also, there was a schedule change on the ticket that I did not confirm. When I called, I was told that I would not get charged the penalty, I ended up getting charged+the fare difference (almost 500$). In addition to the trip cost (200$) for a one way trip. So this has never happened before with any other airline. It would have been easier to cancel and buy a new flight which would have cost me around $800 for a two way.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Belgrade to Athens via Istanbul. My first flight departed with delay from Belgrade due to local weather conditions in Istanbul. I requested for a connection assistance in order to catch my second flight but the airline did not provide me such assistance. I managed to arrive at the gate of departure of my second flight while boarding was not completed and while the screen mentioned 'last call' but I was denied boarding because 'the system had unchecked me from the second flight due to late arrival of my previous plane'. People were boarding in front of my eyes on the plane. The Turkish Airlines officer deceivingly told me to go to another gate (215) because another plane was waiting for me. He just got rid of me. Gate 215 was near the rebooking office of Turkish Airlines for the issuance of new tickets. Although I was condemned to stay overnight at the airport, I was not proposed hotel accommodation or a meal. I was put on another flight departing next morning without even offered the possibility to select my checked seat (the officer rejected my request for an aisle position despite the fact that the plane was half-empty!). I filled a complaint form for denial of boarding and they replied that they are not responsible for a flight delay due to weather conditions. Turkish Airlines maybe is a large company but it manages these type of routine problems poorly as a low budget airline.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Tel Aviv via Ä°stanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but thatâ€™s fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in Ä°stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see whatâ€™s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think itâ€™s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that thereâ€™s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didnâ€™t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because itâ€™s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they canâ€™t get it. And she said you know itâ€™s your fault that it went to Eilat. When I asked her name she refused to give and hanged up on me.',\n",

But there is a fine print somewhere which they always get a disqualified citing some wired â€œrulesâ€\\x9d that I, even as a frequent traveler cannot comprehend. Another notable difference in Turkey is that there are endless and multiple security checks, and one wonders if one is going through a war zone . Lines at security checks and passport control ( yes, if you need to stay at a hotel for a long layover, one needs to get an e-VISA just to get out, check into a hotel and get back to airport to catch the connecting flight).

They gave me a flight for 11:30 pm without providing any hotel accommodations. Later I had to force them to give me a earlier flight as I was tired so they gave me a flight for 8:35pm TK 2018 which also was delayed and the flight departed at 10:50pm. I some how was happy that at least I reached Cappadocia but my whole day and hotel booking was wasted. I went to pick my luggage but as to my surprise my luggage did not arrive and I was told itâ€™s arriving in the next flight and they shall have it sent to my hotel. I came to my hotel and not itâ€™s about 4pm on 17th April and my luggage has still not arrived even after making several calls. This airline has charged me a lot without giving any good service or facility. I would highly recommend not to book Turkish Airlines ever to any one unless they want to waste their time and money. Donâ€™t know when will my luggage arrive and till when I have to sit in my hotel and waste time as I cannot freshen up unless I get my clothes and got out to see this city.',\n",

After booking a confirmed flight on 6th April we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves 2 days earlier than we land. Thankfully we didn't select this by mistake. Then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at Istanbul. We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it. To make matters worse today the check in doesn't work and they've told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats. Avoid this airline for its terrible customer service.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization. Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight. Other airlines offer very similar prices and the cons don't make up for the flight conditions you will experience.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn\\'t leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: \"Wait a minute\".. I didn\\'t want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.\"The flight is full!\". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the \"great\" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule. The service was the mess and the behaviour of the employees was everything but not professional.',\n",

FA told me that now coffee service, they have drinks round, first was drinks, food, coffee and drinks later. I had observed others got their drinks when they ordered randomly. I seem to get the response what their process of service is, and I have to adhere to that, even if I was asleep. The drinks trolley service came by and the same FA who told me â€˜offâ€™ remembered what drinks I had asked and served me. Such a hassle to get a drink because I asked for it out of their sequence. With only twelve hours I guess they are too busy to give much care to passengers.. Sad.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew TK 5 / 22 MAR, Istanbul - Chicago in business class. Had requested AVML (Asian vegetarian Meal). TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant, tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TK's employee and the chef are employed by DO & CO catering company who provided meals for TK's passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given. It will be hard to choose TK for future travel.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | I bought and paid tickets 3 months before departure. I had pre-selected certain seats convenient to us. I am a self-moving disabled person. I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada â€“ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€\\x9d The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.\",\n",

Already the airport lounge, Dhaka, demanded money for a glass of wine, unheard. I am a frequent flyer, I have never experienced business class lounge charging a business class passenger, for a glass of wine. Next, on board, no welcome drinks. I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac. Another female crew rushed and snatched the glass, poured half of the content to another glass and then served the guest. We had a laugh- that was entertaining.- but not convincing for making Turkish Airline the choice any more.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'Not Verified | Boarding totally chaotic and far too long. Nice meal, creepy safety video which distracted the people more than giving them advice. Crew notifications (strong turkish accent, sound quality) hardly understandable, even for native speakers. Economy legroom and seat width did not at all suit the flight duration on the first flight from Phuket to Istanbul (11 hours), more equal to short-distance low costers. (disclaimer: I had a seat at an emergency exit, luckily). WiFi did not work for me and others at all, for some more expensive devices it did, but very slowly (asked my neighbours and staff for help, but no way to get it working). Very expensive seat pre-selection (160+30â‚¬ for a 400â‚¬ flight), so I did not take it and was lucky at the airport check-in.',\n",

Im not sure what happened, but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible, flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year, I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice, and went to sleep. Before landing, the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food. I still appreciate his effort to come up with vegan food.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | I along with my 6.5-month-old son were traveling from London to Kabul via Istanbul. The flight from London got delayed. When I arrived at Istanbul I couldn't find my son's pushchair which was supposed to be next to the aircraft. I had to jump on the bus to get to the next flight but when I arrived that was gone. I was only booked on the next flight leaving 24 hours later. I was not offered any accommodation or any facilities to help me care for my baby. Even the pushchair was not brought to me so at least the little one could sleep. In the past when I had traveled with them with my husband for much shorter stays we would be offered free food and drinks but didn't receive that as well. Because I was a woman with a small child and couldn't argue with them because my son was crying all the time, they just made sure I don't get any help, while I should have been offered more given the circumstances. In light of all this, my son and I suffered very much and it wasn't even our fault. Please avoid this airline they are the worst people to fly with. They pick on people who are more vulnerable and in need. I will never ever fly with this airline again. My problem is not with the delays, delays are part of traveling but when the airline gets it wrong they should have the moral standards to look after their customers especially when its a mother and a child. They should have the mindset as to how to do more, but as I explained above their attitude was how to give less and cheat a mother and a little child.\",\n",

It was supposed to depart 2.20 but THE flight from Istanbul to Cape Town was delayed to 3.25., so some of us slept of in til 2. At 2.30 when we were going to the gates our flight was not in the board anymore. We passed an information desk and she said, gate is closing, you run. We Ran to gate only to See that the gate has closed! THE flight to Cape Town left 2.40, 45 min earlier. And nobody wanted to help only go to desk 214, go to desk 230, go back to 214, go to Information desk etc etc. We were directed to 9 different desks! Then they Said go out to ticket desk and we Will tell them to help you to book for a flight tomorrow. We had to pay for new tickets THE next Day. They didn't help us with a hotel. The next Night when we were at THE Airport again THE same time changes happens and THE flight left again 45 min earlier. They overbook and make time changes but fly earlier so people miss flights.\",\n",

The flight from Dubai was delayed by an hour before it even took off. I asked the gentleman at the counter whether this will affect the transit and he said i have got enough time. I landed in Istanbul at 1:50 PM and my next flight was supposed to be at 2:50 PM and had 1 hour to board. Despite getting off the plane and rushing through the security gate, i reached 10 minutes before the boarding and the staff were so rude to say that you have missed your flight - not even a slightest of empathy in any ones behaviour. I was offered another flight via Toronto after 26 hours. They were not ready to issue any visa to enter the country. Also they told that i need to collect my baggage from lost and found and made me wait there for hours before they could track my luggage. One of the worst crew i have come across across.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me. They have refused to reimburse us with the cost of the hotel & car rental and are fobbing me off regarding the clothing cost. I know that I am legally entitled to this so I will continue to press.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasnâ€™t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasnâ€™t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, Iâ€™ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything thatâ€™s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlinesâ€™ fault and that they didnâ€™t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. Iâ€™ve tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time Iâ€™ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me theyâ€™ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but itâ€™s been 2 months now and I havenâ€™t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didnâ€™t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that theyâ€™ll fully refund me, but arenâ€™t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what Iâ€™ve been through. Itâ€™s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews). Please- save your money, time, and health, and book a different airline.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: \"No, later, later\". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour\\'s at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. \"Of Course Sir, anything you want\". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The \"Onboard Chef\" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can\\'t say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I\\'ve flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don\\'t usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don\\'t really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.',\n",

I had a flight from JFK to Istanbul on the way to Dhaka and had a 12-hour long stay over in Istanbul. While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more, there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency, lack of decency (rude), and lower motivation to cooperate. However, instead of a hotel room, a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast, the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the â€œTransferâ€\\x9d station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they donâ€™t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wifeâ€™s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | My first time on Turkish. It\\'s not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it\\'s far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.) That just about put paid to everyone\\'s plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be. (How hard is it to say \"Good evening\" to a passenger during boarding, instead of giving an icy, silent stare?) In the future, unless I decide to travel to one of the secondary destinations served by TK, such as Salzburg or Lyon, my preference will remain with the more established airlines.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'Not Verified | Vienna to Istanbul. Our morning flight was delayed then eventually cancelled due to the bad weather which is understandable. We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days. The trip from Sabiha airport to our hotel itself costed us twice the price. Pray for our luggage. Hope Turkish Airlines take this matter seriously.',\n",

They deducted miles from my accounts and they don't care, give me weird and general answers over the email. Cabin crew was ok, but missed several safety classes. I paid for emergency seat, Turkish Airlines decided to give to someone else the seat - this guy is Turkish Airlines employee - I saw him with joking around with the cabin crew and they also treated him with some business class beverages, so Turkish Airlines is also corrupted.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to London. On our flight back from Istanbul we handed our baby stroller to Turkish Airlines. When we arrived to London we realized that the stroller was damaged. We started a claim case there at Heathrow airport. An online account was opened for us through which we filled in more information and received an evaluation which said that that THY would compensate the repair. We ordered two pieces of replacement covers and sent the receipts to THY. This was on the 19th of January. Since then we've been trying to resolve the case but we are being ignored. Today I talked to customer service for the 5th time. Every time I'm told that we should hear back in couple days but we never do. This is such a shame. What we claim is not even that much. If we were this responsive when we owed any money to THY we would be fined multiple times. They are getting away with it. It's such a shame for a company which claims to be world class. It's obvious that the quality they stand for is disappearing quickly.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to itÂ´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me \"No, tour is finished\". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that\\'s what I\\'m doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen. Instead, now I want a compensation.',\n",

Got to the departure longue to find utter chaos, 100s of local people trying to board a flight, each carrying with 3 or 4 cabins bags, wedding dresses, quilts and electrical goods. The Turkish airlines staff did their best to bring control and remove bags from shopping happy Uzbeks. The boarding sequence did not work either. Reminds me of a rugby scrum at its best. We were bussed out to a well used aircraft with a very dated cabin. When I got to my window seat I found both seats full of stacked bags. Which had to be removed to the frustration of their owner. Turkish Airlines had an extra 6 or 7 staff on the flight trying to move what seemed 2 tonnes of bags into the hold and to sit people in there assigned seats. The flight had a delayed takeoff, which gave you time to look at a very tired interior, seats were old and lacked support. Leg room was zero and there was no IFE or video screens. The crew gave a manual safety demo and had to control people who wanted to change seats. The flight itself was OK, there was a basic drinks service and a simple meal of kebab meat and rice, there was no vegetation options that I could see off. The crew enforced a strict liquor policy from take off which worked well. Landing was OK and we where loaded into a bus from a remote parking space. Transit through Visa control and baggage collection was fast by Uzbek standards.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good. They do really discriminate passengers from different regions. Providing different services to different passengers.I have traveled quite a lot but never gotsuch treatment.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn\\'t select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn\\'t select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was \"it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass\"\" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn\\'t have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I\\'m not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport \"the next day.\" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn\\'t end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn\\'t have my bag. Then they said that they couldn\\'t pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a \"repair invoice\" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.',\n",

And everything about the flight was sub standard. The seat layout was at least 20 years old, when business class seats hardly just reclined. No storage space. The kit they provided had nothing in it. Cheap stuff. For an around 6 hour flight, no menu cards were provided. The crew serving never bothered to ask if passengers needed anything. One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect. They provided a menu card, the seats layout was modern. Like proper fully reclining seats. I feel awful the way they discriminate with flights from Pakistan.',\n",

We had booked our flights from Durban to Houston (return) which included a stopover of 2 days in Istanbul whereby our journey from Istanbul to Houston was on 16th December 2018 on flight number TK33 at 2.30pm. We had requested wheelchair service in advance. We checked-in on time at Istanbul Airport and waited more than 1 hour for the wheelchair assistant who never came and had to walk by ourselves to the gate. By the time we reached the gate we were denied boarding as they said that we are late. As a result, we had to buy another ticket on Turkish Airlines for 18th December 2018 at the airport which cost us TRY 21519 and this was through no fault of our own. The problem is that the wheelchair assistance never turned up which is the main reason for us being late. We have flown with other airlines and never faced this issue.

When I came out of the plane there is no one to help me out with my flight, I was asking the ground staff and they talk to me in a rude and sarcastic manner because I dont speak Turkish. I was waiting in a very long line (100 people or more, all of them lost their connection flights) to change my ticket. My new ticket was at 20:15 evening and I had arrived at 9 am. I was waiting for 11 hours to go home! They take as at a hotel for almost 4 hours, the hotel and the ground staff had the worst attitude I have ever seen! They didn't show us any respect, long lines, no directions, no answers, no English, nothing except of rudeness. Now I'm home after 26 hours, instead of 14.

My first flight was 35 mins late for unknown reasons, I spent 9 hours waiting for the next available flight. As I was waiting I watched almost every Turkish Airlines that landed had passengers running off to malke it to their next flight. Then my next flight did not have us board till departure time, when it came to loading on the buses they had us wait 20 mins on a cramped bus without opening the doors. Some passengers had to use the emergency latch to open the doors so we can get some air. Then boarding the plane the captain notifies us that we are delayed and no reason with it. Late again to my final destination. Don't fly with Turkish Airlines!\",\n",

The flight was delayed almost one hour due to a technical problem. Due to this delay we missed the connecting flight to Toulouse. Turkish Airlines staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring. The sales desk demanded I buy new tickets at a price of R40,000 ($2,800) and I refused. Customer service was pathetic.

Although the flight and flight crew on my trip from DC to Addis were lovely the crew, plane, food, and customer service on my return trip were horrendous.

The employee told me to go the transfer desk when arriving at Istanbul to get my boarding ticket for Amsterdam and when I went to the transfer desk an employee told me to go to the Denied boarding office because there weren't any seats. I went to the Denied boarding office when it was the last call for my flight due to the excessive delay in the security control. The security control was packed with more than hundreds of people and some even climbed over the fences and it was very chaotic. Anyways when I went to the office the employee then told me that I missed my flight and asked why I came here. I explained everything to him but the only response I got was to go back to the transfer desk. Then when I went back to the transfer desk, the other employee told me to go to the ticket sales desk. I was expecting them to arrange a seat in a flight today but when i went to the ticket sales desk, the employee said that there were no remaining seats and booked me a seat in the next dayâ€™s flight and charged me 500 dollars when it was the airlineâ€™s fault. The service was awful and the employees did not even know how to swiftly deal with such situations.\",\n",

Over two hours into the flight to Erbil when I thought we were already descending, it was announced that we couldn\\'t land and were heading back to Istanbul on account of fog. This meant a 24 hour wait in the airport until the next flight which then was delayed another 90min. Then after everyone had boarded, two buses pull up, \"flight is cancelled\". At this point I could no longer wait, and had to fly back to Berlin. My original return would have been the day before. I spent two hours at the Turkish Airlines transfer desk with a lot of insisting and nerves to finally get this changed at the last minute to the next plane on the same day. The services there was just awful (around 1300 on Dec. 19). Initially I was told, \"everything\\'s ok, just sit there, and we will deliver the ticket to you.\" But as time went on and no one came, I had to go back to the desk and basically start from scratch, dealing with altogether 5 or six officials who spoke hardly any English and were disorganised to the point of reminding one of headless chickens.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | London Gatwick - Istanbul - Tashkent Departed late. Never recovered but cumulated mode delay during flight instead. Cabin crew careless with connecting passengers. \"Don\\'t worry - you will get it on time - be happy\" Breakfast served at 1 pm in the plane (probably cheaper than a lunch) \"entertainment\" looked like retro games on ZX spectrum. 2 hours delay at arrival. Crew didn\\'t assist passengers in transit (actually we could have caught the connection if they had checked the status of the next flight which was 45 min late) Connection missed. Then we were refused a phone call to inform our contact in Tashkent. No WIFI. We were also refused information on our passengers rights. At the airport horrible staff - don\\'t speak any other language than Turkish, shout at you (in case your lack of understanding came from deafness), rude, careless, etc. Overcrowded passport control with locals cheating the queue. Next step : 3 hours queue for the hotel transfer. Again no assistance from TK staff. Not even a glass of water. 11 pm, we finally arrive at the hotel - 1 room for 4 (children don\\'t count in that case, even if they pay a full ticket like adults), No dinner! Can something be done to force TK remove the mention \"Best Europe\\'s airline\" from their ads? For instance, Aeroflot is much better. Never again. Should have travelled via Moscow (much more welcoming and professional)',\n",

Long queues at the check-in desk. Slow processes. Delays in flight schedule from AMS to IST. Late arrival at IST airport. Further delays from IST to AUH. And arriving at Abu Dhabi Airport our suitcases were missing. After a delay of two days the luggage finally arrived at our hotel. We had to buy for 550 euro clothing, underwear, swimwear, footwear, toiletries to rescue us through the first two days of our holiday. Turkish compensated only 170 euro. A disgrace.

Our flight on 30 December (TK0038) was cancelled and we had to connect with their ticket office to finalise a flight for 31 December (TK0042).

As Elite Plus even I was flying economy I have access to Business Class Lounge in any domestic or international flight flying Turkish, what was denied in Taipei my entrance. When I arrive at my seat someone was already seated, they changed me seat, and later I couldn't access internet, need to use from my miles. During flight other passengers in Business Class Received amenity kit and I didn't. I used miles for upgrade both ways and they gave boarding pass just for first sector, I asked Purser about the amenity and as well my ticket second sector because in a previous flight I had same bad experience. They said you should do a feedback form. Waiting answer until now. They used more miles than the top limit on their system that is 75000 miles from Far East to South America, they deducted 100.000 miles. They damage my luggage on arrival. The asked invoice from the luggage I had, and denied payment saying the luggage is fixable, just come and fix for me. The miles accrued was to be 100% on the fare I bought they gave me around 50%.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Athens via Istanbul. This was the worst airline I have flown with. I booked my tickets last minute, it was for me and my 4 month old son. I had 3 suitcases a stroller and 2 carryons. I had paid for the suitcases, but because I was traveling alone I went there with my husband and he politely asked if they could please take the carryons on the plane because she canâ€™t carry everything by herself. The manager came out and said that we have to pay. I said I already paid extra for my suitcases please help us because my wife is carrying our son, the diaper bag and 2 carryons. He was rude stating that we have to pay each carryon. We didnâ€™t have the extra money and my wife took everything with her. If thatâ€™s how Turkish Airline treats their customers, they shouldnâ€™t be operating. It was the last time I use this airline. No dignity or humanity, itâ€™s all only about the money. And when I took the stroller with my son. They made me package the stroller by myself looking that I had my son on me crying and when I asked for help they said that they canâ€™t help me... unbelievable... they see me with 2 carryons a stroller and a baby and they canâ€™t help me.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Bangkok via Istanbul. I traveled with Turkish Airlines on business class back to Bangkok. The check-in was fast as there weren't any queue and the staff work very professionally. i received a priority pass at the security. The airport is huge so I need sometime to walk to the gate. I visited the United Airlines lounge near the gate which was large, modern, clean, had friendly staff and had wide selection of food and drinks. After staying in the lounge I headed to the gate early like it said on the time board but I had to wait at the gate very long and the queue as disorganized and passenger both business and economy were held for another half an hour before boarding. After boarding, I got welcomed by the crew handed out a welcome drink and a menu for lunch. The seat was fully flat, modern and comfortable but the remote control was old and the distance to the magazines was unacceptable and the storage areas was poor. The flight was delayed as the traffic at Heathrow was bad. The in-flight entertainment system which had wide selection of movies, TV programs and many more. The meal was served an hour after takeoff, the food made up of Turkish food which was nice but it tasteless and the option in the menu was poor. The toilet was clean and modern. The flight arrived on time in Istanbul. The airport was crowded, old and had lack of renovation. Fortunately, I had an access to the lounge which was large,clean but crowded, lack of food options and seats. I spent and hour before head to the gate for my flight to Bangkok. The airport was huge and I nearly missed the priority boarding as the time board show the gate late. The service and facilities was the same as the previous flight but the seat included the amenity kit which is really useful on this 10 hour flight. The crew weren't friendly on this flight and not motivated. The flight arrived in Bangkok in the afternoon on the next day on time. I received another priority pass to went through the passport control. My bag arrived on time also. Overall, the airline itself had a good service and business class facilities but the crew should be more friendly and the airport issues should be fixed.\",\n",

Because of that most flights are delayed and there are no places to sit while waiting for a delayed flight. Then really amateur services kick in when the employees start calling for all passengers to group in the back of the room for passport check only to move again to the front after that for the boarding. The fact that I booked extra legroom seat and a plane was changed without any notification (resulting in regular seat) only adds to an unpleasant experience. This was not a low-cost flight, but services appeared so. Food and on-board services won't fix these problems.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100â‚¬ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360â‚¬ per person to 680â‚¬ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn\\'t do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is \"still in process\" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. Middle East airlines was definitely a good experience, I had a problem once with Aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Paris to Dar es Salaam via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is at best unreliable. The nightmare started in August but let me say all in until I travelled in December I changed the ticket 3 times. Every time 'schedule changes'. Then when I travelled, they lost my bag. When they found it, there was a missing item! I wasn't alone missing a luggage at the airport. Turkish airlines is just very unprofessional. I bought their ticket because of competitive prices, but if I calculate the ticket price and the time and money to call them (because of their issues), I should just have bought a ticket from a superior company like Emirates or Qatar. Spare yourself from ruining your vacations and avoid these unprofessional people!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Vienna to San Francisco via Istanbul. Flight experience was ok and satisfying. Customer complaints handling a disaster. TK did not credit status miles as on the ticket. But no way to get an answer why. All online contacts tried. Autogenerated answers, refusal to accept messages in language of home page. Refusal of message because form not filled completely (no miles and smiles number, we cannot deal with your message). And last \"You may contact with related Airlines customer service for the transactions\". All from email accounts that would not accept answers. My take is clear: TK does knowingly produce wrong and misleading information on tickets, and laugh at customers asking for remedy for non provided services. Hence, neither me nor any company member I have to authorize will fly TK from now on.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Los Angeles. Ground crew is just terribly unhappy. Rude and condescending. They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and thatâ€™s Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me itâ€™ll be 45 min and they canâ€™t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something donâ€™t leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldnâ€™t care. I would say go pay a little more and pick better service. Itâ€™s not that I lost something, itâ€™s how the crew treated me after having dropped an item that I could have retrieved if they had let me look for it',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines needs to offer transfer service options (maybe even check in at pick up location) like Emirates does if it wants to remain competitive as the current arrangements for the new Istanbul Airport are greatly inadequate. The check-in kiosks are still not operating reliably. TGS staff were present to offer assistance. However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities. Boarding conducted in a orderly manner and on-time departure. The 2Ã—2 seating business class product on this fairly new 737-800 is as good as it gets with IFE and ample space. The breakfast offering was of good quality with a tasety Turkish cheese selection and cold cuts. The scrambled eggs main dish was average. Very good selection in the bread basket. Attentive crew and smooth landing on time arrival to Baku, which is probably the best airport in the region and a pleasure to fly in to. TK offering a very good onboard product with major shortcomings on the ground, IT and customer service side devaluing their product.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines is the best domestic service and value within Europe. Turkish domestic flights across the board are quite cheap by EU and US standards, having paid $40 for a flight comparable to Boston-New York or London-Paris. Boarding was quite speedy and orderly, and what a treat to be on an enormous long-haul aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER on such a short route, really feels special. Legroom and seat width are stellar by domestic or international standards, with a very neat and clean appearance. Inflight entertainment was not activated for this roughly hour-long journey, but a standard Turkish-style warm cheese sandwich was provided, the quality of which rivals $9 buy on board options in the USA. Cabin crew, of course, were professional and quick but not rushed. Arrival into Izmir was smooth, and we arrived at an actual gate, as opposed to needing to take a bus from a remote stand. Overall, this journey was well worth spending a few more bucks than the bus or flying Pegasus.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'Not Verified | Toronto to Cairo via Istanbul. Worst experience ever. On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just donâ€™t take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service. All I wanted from them was to give exact and clear information on what can be done to deal with them being late. Instead, they just let us wander around and wasted Everyoneâ€™s time. Never again will I go with them even if the alternative is more expensive.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Ankara to Frankfurt on Turkish Airlines. Quick check in using the priority counter. Following passport control headed to the lounge which was too warm and had the very basic selection of food and beverages. This lounge is worlds away from TKâ€™s lounge in Istanbul and one of the worst I have ever visited. The WiFi did not work despite repeated attempts. Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FAâ€™s went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as â€œPriorityâ€\\x9d my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such. I have been using TK regularly in recent years and the decline in quality has been steady. The next time I travel to Turkey, I will most likely choose a different carrier.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FAâ€™s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FAâ€™s do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations. This is a very concerning display of TKâ€™s safety culture and raises questions about the rest of their operations.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Ankara to Amsterdam via Istanbul. After a mediocre Business class flight to Turkey with them, we decided to stay at Economy for our flight back. The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESB-IST flight which over-hastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. IST-AMS service was alright, although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere, only getting worse. Also, the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible - barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of low-cost carriers. They used to be my favorite airline, not anymore. I no longer prefer them if I have another major airline option on any route.',\n",

A lot of choices and a very good responsive personal entertainment system, the food is really good and the quantity of the food they offered you is certainly enough. You receive an amenity kit on the long haul flight, which is a nice touch. There is live television and WiFi on board, but the Wifi was quite expensive. The live television worked perfect, I could watch a live soccer match! Downside is that the crew sometimes a bit tired looks and act. The layover in Istanbul is a bit chaotic. My bags arrived in Havana and also on the way back in Amsterdam. My conclusion is that Turkish Airlines offers a good product, when you compare it with the price. I would choose them again and can recommend them.\",\n",

Boarding queuing up everyone in the queue for a while they decided to call rows out we were nearly first going in and nearly last by the end not a good start, went down hill from there on.  Seats mixed up even though we asked for certain seats luckily some people swapped with us - we asked one one of the staff could they please sort the seats out, they didn't care. We had to do it ourself as we have 2 small daughters not sitting beside us. Nothing for kids no kids menu or kids toys or colouring books to keep them entertained for the flights. .The staff from Istanbul to Phuket were the worst most miserable people we have ever came across on a flight. Spilling drinks on customers not smiling didn't want to be there. Turkish have a long way to go to catch up with other airlines. Food was only ok nothing special.

Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight. This flight and this airport is never to be recommended.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | London to Kigali via Istanbul. This airline customer service team letâ€™s it down. If you have any issues, they simply wonâ€™t help you. Before, during or after the flight. If you complain they simply donâ€™t respond and if they do itâ€™s a very blunt rude answer. I tried reaching out to this airline via Facebook, phone, email and linked in and they actually ignored me. This airline tried to charge me Â£27 per extra kg when I told them I was taking donations across for kids in Uganda. My friends luggage got lost and they offered him nothing and didnâ€™t return any of his emails or calls whilst we were away! Airline service is average but even if it was ok I could never fly with this airline again because of how they regard their customers. Food was ok, seat room was decent. WiFi didnâ€™t work.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadn't flown Turkish in 4 years, and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777, even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual, not enough gates at Ataturk airport, and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning. Again, this problem should be solved when the move to the New Istanbul Airport happens hopefully in early January 2019.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Montreal. The boarding process was interesting. Firstly, you cannot do online check-in as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves. We departed slightly late but landed almost 20 minutes early which was the cherry on top.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I was rather underwhelmed by the new Istanbul Airport. To say that the airport resembled a construction site would be a understatement. TK has a few check-in counters operational for limited international operations. Self check-in kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge, just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for B/C and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew. The hard product also very good with 2x2 seating, IFE and fresh looking cabin on this relatively new 737-800. On time departure and arrival. Would have appreciated a fast track arrangement for TK premium passengers at GYD.',\n",

Check-in prompt and courteous. The lady asked me if I would like to check-in for my return flight as well, so I did. Had plenty of time so strolled around the magnificent new terminal. Through security - seems to have modern systems which speed up the process. As yet they don't have their Business Class lounge open. Instead was invited to a small cafe where various complimentary items were offered. Served by two extremely courteous young guys. Boarding on time. During the flight a hot light meal served. Actually it looked and tasted rather dried out but I ate it anyway as was hungry. Cabin crew were very smiley and courteous. Landed early and door was open some 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Basically an excellent flight but one point dropped because of the meal.\",\n",

Hadn\\'t even been on an aircraft with a 2-4-2 seating arrangement, but this is perfect for couples (was travelling with fiancÃ©e) as no need to disturb anyone else if needing out of our seats. Cabin crew were professional and efficient in meal and drinks services. Enjoyed the safety video, if a bit cheesy! Some downsides would be only adequate leg room for a 6\\'3\" man like myself, expensive on board WIFI ($9.99 for a hour) and cabin crew turning a blind eye to foolhardy impatient passengers who insisted on getting up and opening the overhead lockers while the plane was still taxiing! Finally, I always believe it\\'s good practice for a cabin crew member to do an announcement to welcome passengers to the destination, especially on a long haul flight, however this was not done on any of the four flights I took.

Whilst making a booking, picked Mr instead of Ms, when we rang the company we were told we needed to buy a new ticket. Apparently once you make a purchase you can not amend anything on this ticket. Is this a joke? The whole policy is set out in a way that exploits the customer. Every single change costs hundreds of Â£Â£Â£. Even something as simple as changing title will now cost an additional Â£500 for a new ticket. How can you have a system so inefficient.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Cape Town to Gatwick via Istanbul. I have used Turkish Airlines many times on long haul routes and find the combination of modern / new planes, attentive but not overpowering service, excellent food and free wifi in business class to be a match for some airlines and better than a good number. This trip to Johannesburg and back from Cape Town was comfortable with good meals. Transiting Istanbul Ataturk is always interesting although it is bursting at the seams. The Turkish lounge is vast but starting to look worn. I assume there is no desire to spend money ahead of the move to the new airport. Turkish remains my airline of choice.',\n",

Everyone had to wait at least another one and a half-two hours or even more at the airport for this. Thatâ€™s okay this thing can happen. However, I talked to agents of Turkish Airlines about my luggage and their attitudes were terrible. I felt like I was the one who did wrong. They said I shouldâ€™ve carried on the plane with me if I had something that important. I get it. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s not my fault at all. However, they shouldâ€™ve not said that with that kind of attitude and treated me like Iâ€™m the one who made all this mess. I will not use this airline again. Very disappointed. Plus my seat was terrible. Donâ€™t know why, I wasnâ€™t able to push the seat back so had to fly 12 hours with the uncomfortable seat.

The plane seemed to be pretty old, with an old school PTV - there is PTV, but it's not touchscreen nor anything on demand, you could only choose from the few existing channels. Since it's a flight less than 2 hours so it's not a big problem. A excellent light meal was served. I had a long layout in Istanbul so I left the airport for a while. Istanbul airport was a bit crowded, that's why the new airport is opening soon. The next flight, IST-JNB, is on a A333. The food was also good - probably the best food I've ever had in economy, but there's only one option if you didn't book special meal, so it might be a problem with some people. The seat pitch wasn't very good for a long haul flight but still acceptable. Amenities were good. Overall, I was impressed and would definitely like to travel with TK next time.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g. A honeymoon), I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip. Thank you for ruining our honeymoon journey.',\n",

My son, who had lost his grandmother had to deal with the customer service employee who was unempathetic and dismissive.

We had to take this option as we had to be there on time for my mothers funeral. When I went to the Turkish Airlines office in Turkey after 10 days, they told me I cannot get a refund because I already used my ticket. I told them this is what the customer service told me, and the reply is \"There is nothing we can do\". But it was the Turkish Airlines representative who persuaded us not to cancel our flights and change them instead.

Few days later I received a notice that my luggage and will be sent to me in Florida. I finally picked it up at the FEDEX on 09/29 center where I found out some irregularities: my suitcase was damaged, my digital camera and camera were missing, few pairs of shoes were missing as well as some souvenirs from my trip. I immediately called the customer service the same day to make aware of the situation but their customer care is in Romania and claimed that they could not do anything. They referred me to their website. I didnâ€™t have time to do so because homework and my business trip the next week from 10/01-10/05. When I got back on 10/06, I filed a claim and Turkish Airlines sent me a standard message reading: \"Firstly, we would like to apologize to you for the irregularity you have suffered. Pursuant to the transportation regulations, any irregularities in relation to baggage must be communicated to our Company in writing, within 7 days at the latest. Therefore, we would like to inform you that we could not response your request positively. We wish you not to encounter suchlike irregularities, kind regards\". First my luggage arrived 7 days later. Second I contacted their customer service right away and they sent me this non sense.',\n",

Asking people to be at the gate 1 hour prior to boarding, which then usually starts 10-20 minutes prior to departure. Sometimes only at the time of departure. No information from gate staff, never, whatsoever. Never apologizes for delay, simply never. Seat pre-booking doesnt work. E-boarding pass can not be issued for flights starting outside Turkey usually, so you need to pick up at the check in counter anyway and do the queue (we have 2018).

Alas, on neither my London to Istanbul flight or Istanbul flight did I get it. Not great. Then with a flight leaving at 10.35am - they decide to serve breakfast (about 11.30). Most of us have got up at 6 am to get this flight - what about serving lunch instead? However, this is all minor stuff - what really annoyed me is for the second leg of my return flight (Istanbul to London) they seated me and my partner apart. This is despite the fact that we booked our tickets ages ago! Forgetting common sense, you would have through it pretty basic - wherever possible, seat people who book together, together. It's not rocket science! Despite a call from Addis to Istanbul (which annoyingly cost me over Â£20) to their call centre - there is nothing they can do about this! Question - so if the plane doesn't even do flat seats, and then they don't even seat you together - why fly Turkish Business?\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn\\'t quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn\\'t. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to \"contact a different department\", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That\\'s normal. What wasn\\'t normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that \"we are a third party engaged by the airline\" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR. Case is not yet closed.',\n",

Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good.

On August 20th I filed a request for compensation \"We have registered your feedback with reference number TK-1385157 . We aim to reply to your feedback within 7 days by completing the necessary research and evaluation\" Today - a month later - I received a nonsensical response, and no refund.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Our flight from Venice to Nairobi provided a two-hour stopover in Istanbul. Two weeks before departure we were advised that the flight to Istanbul Nairobi had been anticipated and that therefore we would have had only one hour of call but that we would have done it easily (before confirming the acceptance of the flight change, we talked with the customer service Turkish who gave us confirmation - I hope that the phone calls are recorded, as well as an email in which we confirmed that we would have made it). As expected, the flight from Venice to Istanbul leaves late. We get off the plane at 18.05. The flight to Nairobi would leave at 18.40 but already on the panel appeared written \"gate closed\". We go to the gate and at 18.15 we are there the flight was due to leave at 18.40) and the gate is actually closed and the plane has already left. They send us to a desk for customer support that is not the right one and we find out after 10 minutes of waiting thanks to another customer who warns us. After having gone through 3 Turkish desk (Ataturk airport is not really small ...) we arrive at the correct one where in an absolutely rude manner they warn us that we would have to wait 24 hours for the next plane. Without baggage. They still give us assistance by providing us with a hotel and full board. They ask us if we prefer it near the airport or the center of istanbul and we ask that it be the center. They make us get on a bus without telling us where we were going and leave us in a hotel near the airport ... no ifs and buts, without even the foresight to say: sorry in the center was all full. We lose 24 hours of vancaza, the hotel booked in Nariobi, the various visits etc. ruined holiday. We are asking for a refund. They are denying it. saying that we agreed to have only 1 hour stopover: we agreed to have 1 hour of call, true - we never agreed to lose the connection. (mail and turkish phone calls in hand) we go ahead and we do not give up. (nothing to complain about the convenience of flight, meals etc, all unexceptionable). IT: l nostro volo da Venezia a Nairobi prevedeva uno scalo di due ore ad Istanbul. Due settimane prima della partenza siamo stati avvisati che il volo Istanbul Nairobi era stato anticipato e che quindi avremmo avuto solo un\\'ora di scalo ma che ce l\\'avremmo fatta agevolmente (prima di confermare l\\'accettazione del cambio volo, abbiamo parlato con il customer service Turskish che ci ha dato conferma - spero che le telefonate siano registrate, oltre che ad una mail in cui ci confermavano che ce l\\'avremmo fatta). Come c\\'era da aspettarsi, il volo da Venezia ad Istanbul parte in ritardo. Scendiamo dall\\'aereo alle 18.05. Il volo per Nairobi sarebbe partito alle 18.40 ma giÃ\\xa0 sul pannello compariva scritto \"gate closed\". Ci fiondiamo al gate e alle 18.15 siamo lÃ¬ (ribadisco il volo sarebbe dovuto partire alle 18.40) ed il gate Ã¨ effettivamente chiuso e l\\'aereo Ã¨ anche giÃ\\xa0 partito. Ci mandano ad un desk per assistenza clienti che non Ã¨ quello corretto e lo scopriamo dopo 10 minuti di attesa grazie ad un\\'altra cliente che ci avvisa. Dopo per essere passati per 3 desk Turkish ( l\\'aeroporto Ataturk non Ã¨ proprio piccolo... ) arriviamo a quello corretto dove in maniera assolutamente sgarbata ci avvisano che avremmo dovuto aspettare 24 ore per l\\'aereo successivo. Senza bagaglio. Ci danno comunque assistenza fornendoci un albergo e pensione completa. Ci chiedono se lo preferiamo vicino all\\'aeroporto o al centro di istanbul e chiediamo che sia il centro. Ci fanno salire su di un pulmino senza dirci dove stessimo andando e ci lasciano in un albergo vicino all\\'aeroporto ... senza se e senza ma, senza neanche l\\'accortezza di dire: ci spiace in centro era tutto full. Perdiamo 24 ore di vancaza, l\\'albergo prenotato a Nariobi, le varie visite etc. vacanza rovinata. Stiamo chiedendo il rimborso. Ce lo stanno negando. dicendo che abbiamo accettato di avere solo 1 ora di scalo: abbiamo accettato di avere 1 ora di scalo, vero. non abbiamo mai accettato di perdere la coincidenza. (mail e telefonate turkish alla mano) andiamo avanti e non ci arrendiamo. (niente da ridire sulla comoditÃ\\xa0 del volo, pasti etc, tutto ineccepibile)',\n",

We requested mobility assistance and the customer service reassured us that it is already fixed. When we arrived in Istanbul airport, the flight crew who assisted me get off the plane just left us without any explanation or instruction. We were clueless where should we go and where should we wait. When we asked an airport staff, he just told us in a rude manner to stay where we are and wait for the assistance for the next flight. We were so unsure and worried so we asked again a ground crew if there is an assistance coming to help me. I am handicapped and cannot walk so we really need this assistance. Boarding time is 1:05 am and it was already 12:50 and no help came. We just went to the gate by ourselves. We asked the ground crew about the assistance but all the ground crew are clueless how am I going to get in the plane. All the passengers are boarding and we are still waiting.

The crew was very efficient and helpful, and the bottle of water they give out in economy is a nice touch. The inflight entertainment system is excellent and easy to use. Wifi is offered but for a price in economy which I choose not to avail of. On the return flight the captain paid a visit to the economy section and talked and joked with a number of the passengers. I wish Turkish Airlines would bring back the Turkish food they used to serve in Economy (the menu was the same when I last flew with them in December 2017), and they would stop showing the silly safety videos.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew with Turkish Airlines on the 2nd of September from Dhaka-Istanbul-London. Don't get me wrong, the service was good. Food was decent, and entertainment was also pretty good. However the one thing that Turkish Airlines is really poor on is transit flight. The airport staff are slow, very ruthless and have no courtesy at all. You may say this is the airport's fault, but this was mainly seen from Turkish Airlines staff. The staff on my flight were a bit rude, and when you asked for something to drink, you would need to ask repeatedly as they wouldn't bring you a drink. Anyways, our flight was delayed from Istanbul. No surprise. Made us feel like we were flying on a really bad airline and especially due to the delays at both Dhaka and Istanbul. We landed at London, only to find out that half of the plane's luggage did not arrive. All the transit flight luggage were missing and consequently delayed. It's now been 6 days since I've flown, and I have not received some of the luggage. It's appalling especially when its with an airline you have huge expectations for. I don't know how on earth they lost that many bags, but it just shows how unprofessional and un-trained their staff are at their 'hub airport'. I just hope you all never face this in the future. And to make sure about that avoid, avoid, avoid.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Bangkok to London via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines gave me an impressive service to me along the flight. They gave me priority pass for security in Bangkok and passport control in London, but not in Istanbul. Both aircraft have comfortable seat and wide range of facilities. The In-flight entertainment have wide range of movies and TV programs but poor option of games. Since I sat on window seats on both flights it quite difficult to get out while seat of the neighbor is recline. The crew were friendly and helpful. The food selection were fairly wide but the taste weren't very impressive. The seat have facilities like USB port and power outlet which was fast but place in difficult area to reach. The magazines etc were difficult to reach as they were located near the personal screen, which is large. The pilot of both flights were informative and make an impressive smooth landings. The lounge in Bangkok (Eva Air lounge) and in Istanbul was modern and have wide range of food selection. However, the only thing I didn't like is Turkish Airlines Hub, Istanbul Airport which is small, crowded and unorganized.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Prague on Turkish Airlines. Following a smooth check-in processed by a helpful and pleasant agent we made our way to the lounge. The lounge was crowded but there was ample space compared to the cramped, noisy and hot main terminal. Istanbul airport is a nightmare unless you have access to the Turkish Airlines lounge. After a few beverages and snacks we made our way to the gate. Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FAâ€™s was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline. They are rude, unprofessional and have extremely poor language skills. Turkish has to deal with this deficiency as a matter of priority otherwise they will at best be a mediocre carrier.',\n",

He offered me an option to upgrade to first class for $250 and when I said no he started asking personal questions about how much money I was carrying and how many american dollars exactly. Then he wanted me to verify my residence in Istanbul and other details which he had no business asking. It was as if he was punishing me for not upgrading for an additional $250. He was not a customs officer nor a representative of the Turkish embassy whom i had provided financial details and following which they had granted me my visa. When i showed him my hotel booking he asked me to leave the counter. The entire experience was unlike anything i have encountered before and what shocked me even further was that upon submitting a complaint to Turkish Airlines, I received a standard PR generated response which was frankly laughable.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. Itâ€™s the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that Iâ€™ve ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. Iâ€™m amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it canâ€™t even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience. Looking forward to seeing how they resolve my ongoing problems! Travellers beware when booking international connections with Turkish Airlines - the cheaper fares could truly deliver a cheap and nasty experience youâ€™ll remember for a long time!',\n",

Beside the very short connection in Istanbul that caused me had to run for the next flight, it was a quite good experience. It started with a friendly checkin staff that moved us to the emergency exit row so I had plenty of legroom for my 190cm. Service onboard was good with nice meal for a 3h flight, and crew was a very friendly. The only issue was that they was that they didn't provide gate info for the next flight from Istanbul and our 55 minutes layover was only 40min because of delay on first flight, so we had to run for the most remote gate. Flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was older B777 with 3-3-3 config, with legroom thais equal to Emirates B777 but wider seats. IFE not at the same level as Emirates and old screen. Friendly crew and nice meal.

Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick â€“ Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldnâ€™t tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldnâ€™t go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didnâ€™t think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying. They then put half of our group in Business class half in economy. An absolute shambles. Never fly with this airline, they were horrendous in every aspect.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Detroit to Vienna via Istanbul. This is a complaint about the flight from Istanbul to Vienna (8/22/2018). I booked my flight since March 2018 from USA and have chose my seats in advance. I checked in at Detroit airport then again at Boston airport and received my boarding pass with the seat numbers that I have chose. During my actual flight from Istanbul to Vienna I was told that my seat is not available (6F) and was told to sit at 6D instead.. I went inside the plane, and I saw the entire seats occupied at (6). I notified the flight attendant, she said ok go back to the end of the plane. I refused to do so! She called the manager , and she told me that those people will not not leave their seats and thatâ€™s I have only two options, either to leave the flight immediately and wait for the next flight or to go and accept seat 20C. The flight attendants were rude with me even during the inflight service. I donâ€™t think I will travel with this company again.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Istanbul. Check-in staff at JFK airport were incredibly rude and unhelpful. I had very little time to board as standby and they held me up for ages over checking my carry-on because a group of them rudely pointed out to me there was no way it qualified as a carry on. (It had on Delta, however). Extremely unprofessional as a group of them stood behind the counter talking and laughing about me while I was paying to check my now extra bag. They were so cold and unable to empathize, that for that experience alone I would never willfully fly Turkish Airlines again. On the flight I pressed the call button twice because I never had time to grab water and the small glass they give you a couple times isnâ€™t enough for an 11 hour flight. My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out. When passengers were up and confused about the direction of where to go they were curtly told â€œyou canâ€™t pass through hereâ€\\x9d and then ignored. No smile, nothing. Such a terribly disappointing experience. Oh and the bathrooms were out of toilet paper for a long time.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | The plane was a fairly new A330-300 (TC-JOF, first flew in 2015). Boarding a Turkish flight used to be a challenge, but not this time. They divided us into business, economy row 27 which worked really well. Standard Turkish Airlines economy cabin, the seat itself not very comfortable, okay legroom. Not better or worse than any other economy seat on a wide-body plane. I usually love the food on Turkish Airlines, both quality and quantity-wise. However this time, the food wasn't as good as it used to be, especially the rice. (It hasn't been that long since I last flew Turkish). Quantity-wise it was fine, we got served dinner, snacks and a breakfast. The crew, on the other hand, was outstanding. Way better than any other TK flight I've taken. They were really nice and helpful, and actually wanted to talk to people! There were plenty of new films on the IFE system. I usually don't watch any films on the IFE, but I watched 4 films this time! We departed on time and actually landed early (I think they do it in case they need to fly around IST before landing). I got the in-flight Wi-Fi for 15$ and it worked fine.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Dubai. My flight was at 12:30am, and I was off to the airport by 8pm. Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didnâ€™t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, itâ€™s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to itâ€™s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldnâ€™t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldnâ€™t even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers. I will never ever fly them again - hell they are not even the cheapest, just spend that few extra hundred to be on Emirates or other more reputable airline. They donâ€™t deserve to be in the skies and in business.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. For some reason the flight to Istanbul was delayed in about 25 minutes so instead of 75 minutes I only had 50 minutes for the connection. Once landed crew called all passengers to Tel Aviv to hurry up (a delay that was caused because of you), now obviously I was in a hurry and thought it\\'s good that they are aware of the problem and since operating both flights probably leave the gate open a few more minutes. I got to the gate and they just closed it, the ground crew was still there and had last passengers on the jet bridge. Frustrating as it was seeing the plane just standing there for about half hour and the only thing separating me from getting back to my mother\\'s funeral on time was a door. I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I\\'m not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight. The answer I got is: \"Lounge is only for business passengers\" so I\\'m not allowed to go there and I can use one of the restaurant\\'s free wi-fi (obviously didnâ€™t work). So had to wait 5 hours for the next flight feeling like nobody cares and really trying to help me. It was not just one of your employees, I spoke to about 8 different people trying to explain my situation and they all kept sending me back and forth until I realized they are just trying to get rid of me. I would not fly with Turkish Airlines if known they are not able to get me in time for the funeral. I never post this kind of things, but I got such a disrespectful service! and think people should know they are the worst!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Minsk via Istanbul. I am a Deaf passenger. I called IST Hotel Desk office and Turkish Airlines Customer Relations prior to my departure to Istanbul for stopover and Turkish Airlines staff confirmed by phone that they will provide hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast for my long layover - stopover 20 hours after my arrival at IST on August 10, 2018 on way before connecting flight to Minsk, Belarus. Turkish Airlines Customer Relations asked me do not worry and promised that Turkish Airlines will take care of the hotel accommodation very well. They assured that there IST hotel desk will arrange to ensure hotel accommodation will be provided. When I arrived at IST and they refused dumped me away from standard service/accommodation and IST airport staff at hotel desk said that they will not provide me a hotel or tour with breakfast for my long layover 20 hours at Istanbul. I realized that Turkish Airlines is not honest did not follow ethics practice and fooled me against their advertising about stopover program with hotel and tour. I am concerned with Turkish Airlines's lack of integrity and assurance. I slept on floor mat during long layover 20 hours at IST airport. From my understanding, Turkish Airlines website posted all information online that economy class passengers will have a hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast during long layover. They treated me poorly because I am deaf passenger and passenger with disability. I do not appreciate Turkish Airlines' fraud with hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast that were not provided actually. I lost trust in Turkish Airlines. I feel regretting to purchase a ticket and choose to fly with Turkish Airlines. I spent wasted $30 visa for nothing at IST and I did not see Istanbul during stopover - long layover 20 hours. Turkish Airlines put me to sleep on floor mat at IST for a long layover that was disgraceful.\",\n",

The flight from Bucharest to Istanbul was ok, only 55 minutes time, but they provided snacks and drinks which is wonderful considering the flight time. Istanbul to Dubai on Boeing 777-300er, new plane and excelent cabin crew, they served dinner and beverages. The flight was on time. On the return leg, Dubai to Istanbul, the aircraft was Airbus A330-300, with a 2-4-2 configuration, which was better for us. The plane was a bit older than the previous one, but the entertaining system was ok, plenty of choices to watch. Cabin crew were wonderful, you can tell that they are hard working and also very professional. The only inconvenient is Ataturk airport because it is too crowded, there are a lot of flights departing and landing at the same time and you have to spend a lot of time in the aircraft untill take off and also after landing which causes delays. There werenâ€™t any problems with the luggage, but I think that the ground staff that handles the luggage should be more careful as the suitcases came a little bit damaged after the flights. I saw that they are throwing them quite hard when handling. All in all, I would recommend Turkish Airlines.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Kinshasa to Brussels via Istanbul. I used to be a fan of Turkish Airlines, flew them several time and rarely had an issue - but that was about 2 years ago! Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage. And cherry on the cake, I've been stuck at home all day waiting for them to deliver my suitcases (were supposed to do it from 1pm to 6pm, then from 6pm to 8pm - it's 8:43pm and still nothing). I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet. Never have I seen such disorganization, lack of communication and disdain for customers. And with all that, they don't even bother to send an apology email, or offer compensation - nothing! Dont fly them!! They used to be good, but clearly not anymore.\",\n",

I quite like Turkish Airlines and have flown them extensively throughout the world, in both economy and in the no-longer-existent Comfort Class. This was my first trip, using miles, to fly in Business Class. The crew was attentive, well-groomed and projected a nice, professional image. The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings. No menu, a surprise, and the crew rolled a cart down the aisle showing unwrapped entrees. I selected the fish and sad to say it felt like I was eating a 5TL fish sandwich on the Eminonou dock. The entrÃ©e was very poor quality, tasteless, and cheap. It cost me a lot of miles and a lot of euros to take this flight',\n",

Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.\",\n",

It was raining heavily and as usual, there was a terrible air traffic in Manila that we had to make a turn around Manila airspace three times. Then, the pilot announced that an airplane got stuck in the runway, so the plane has to be diverted temporarily to Clark International airport. We sat inside the plane at Clark airport for about 2.5hrs, and the cabin crew did not even gave food or drinks to the passengers',\n",

They came to me at the end of both segments to ask whether I liked the service and enjoyed the flight.

Meal quality and quantity great. I was pleased to see that Turkish is testing the dine on-demand concept on the Singapore to Istanbul route. I was told that such a concept will be gradually introduced across all their long-haul flights. Ataturk airport crazy busy as usual - looking forward to the opening of the new airport in October. Due to very bad weather over India, the first flight landed in Istanbul behind schedule and one of my four luggage did not make it to the final destination.

After waiting for at least an hour, the agent told me the bags were in Turkey and that they would be delivered sometime in the next 2 days. Iâ€™m lucky I had some spare clothes in my carry-on. I called Turkish everyday ever since and just yesterday (July 4th) they told me they basically have no idea where my 2 suitcases are. All agents are very unhelpful and have no idea what is going on. I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didnâ€™t even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things.

       "  'customer_review': \"Not Verified | Istanbul to Manila. Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect. I wanted Turkish Arlines to be good, sorry to say they are not, they are way behind other carriers on the Manila route, way behind other carriers on long haul routes, its certainly a case of running before they can walk.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flight-time 20:05 as the check-in time for 22:05. After a two-week holiday, my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror, I discovered that the gate was closed! And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport. On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore. The night pack contains the most useful things for a more comfortable flight.',\n",

I was confused to go to which gate to take my next flight. I asked few people to find a way. I got to know i have to go to gate no 504. So moved to gate number 504. I reached there at 19:57. The guy who was at boarding counter told me that gates are closed. I told him how is it possible as I have the boarding pass and still there are 23 minutes left. Then he asked me to go to the transfer desk and assure me they will help me in this matter. I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high. When I paid the entire money and have nothing left out I asked them I have no money left for anything to eat. They told me they will provide food every 5 hour - once i got the new ticket and after 14 hour I reached them and asked for food and they denied even for tea. Next day when I boarded the flight, flight delayed for 1:30 hour and we waited without our fault.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats. There seems to be a problem with the seat plan they are looking at, which is likely inconsistent with the real seats of the plane. I probably will not take this airline again.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flying to Bangkok to see my father before his operation was going smoothly until I arrived in Istanbul. The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.\",\n",

Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations. The Istanbul Ataturk airport also has plenty of shopping and eating options, smoking area. Overall my experience has been very positive with Turkish Airlines, despite the above mentioned hiccup which they fairly rectified. I would and definitely will fly with them again.\",\n",

The boarding process was done by letters and was very without issues. Onboard I was impressed with the cleanliness of the aircraft and how new it was (no more than 3-5 years old). The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well. Flight was operated with an A330-200 which I found odd for such a short leg. Very clean plane, relatively new and same great entertainment system. Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service. Turkish are still allowing two free checked bags for economy passengers. I would say Turkish service is on par or even slightly better than Lufthansa but at a much better price.

Literally, I have been bumped out of my seat by someone at Turkish Airlines. I called their contact center and talked for an hour. They said they are going to fix this error and get back to me in an hour. Nobody called for 6h so I called them back but this time the person on the other side of the phone said that there is nothing he could do other than transferring me to their complaints department. Typical TK and their miserable customer services. Now, this department simply does not exists in Turkish Airlines. There is no single person in the entire world whose case was solved by this department. I am sick of everytime getting their standard answer back like â€œOperational Reasons\". Turkish Airlines is a monopoly with no passenger rights at all. Itâ€™s been 2 days by now and nobody called back and no emails sent with the subject.

Flight 100% full with first generation of Boeing 777-300ER cabin a bit of age but with 3-3-3 seating in Y class, seat 48 cm. wide and very comfortable with good leg room. Cabin crew very organized and professional., they ran the first service aperitif with peanut and drinks and handed over the meal menu to passengers follow by the tasty late supper (2 choice) service. Meal was tasty with full choice of drinks incl. wine beer and other alcoholic beverage. After meal service before turn off the lighting cabin crews provided 1 bottle of water to every passenger. Older IFE on this flight with less choices of games and movies which unfortunately not translated in exotic languages. During the night flight cabin crew came with drinks or ice cream. 2 Hours before landing we were woken up with tasty breakfast and warm rolls and croissant. All in all no negative claim - TK offers top Y class product. I was very satisfied and had a beautiful trip HAM-IST-BKK on TK. Attractive price, flight on time, cabin crew very attentive and excellent inflight service.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didnâ€™t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless. If you can opt for another European Airline instead of THY, please do so.',\n",

Only two minuses were baggage delivery at IST - the monitors are not updated regularly or are too small for such a big number of arrivals so our baggage was already out and we still did not see information about the belt and the staff at the SAW airport. I had the feeling that there we were punished for flying with Turkish as the airport is hub for the competition airline. Boarding was not even announced properly, just somebody shouted. On the return flight stop over in IST was very pleasant with smooth security control. In flight service great, friendly staff, good food. The only minus is big difference in equipment.

The flight was delayed 3 hours and when asked about connecting flight the staff could give no information, said just to wait and maybe we would still make the connecting flight.

When I called the online service the staff was extremely unhelpful and refused to find a manager for me, when I called back she said she was referring me to customer service but really just left me on hold for 10 minutes until I hung up.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Munich via Istanbul. Do not fly with Turkish Airlines, especially if you fly coach. The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don\\'t call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5\\'11\" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5\\'4\" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston, but because of the time difference, it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number, +90 212 444 08 492, and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved, but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that, she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats, I approved releasing the seats - and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone. She did rebook us in three seats together, but the thought of sitting in those horribly cramped seats is something all three of us are I gave a 1 point overall rating because this page required a rating. Otherwise, I would have not have given any points!',\n",

We had 1 hour and 45 mins delay from Antalya to Istanbul causing us to miss our connecting flight to London. We had not missed the flight completely but as we got to the gate the airport security said they cannot let us board the plane as Turkish Airlines have stop anyone from boarding 15 mins prior to take off. I spoke to the management in Antalya in regards to a possibility of missing our connection flight at the rate the delay was going. The staff was so calm and collective to say its all fine, you will be on the flight without issue. Bear in mind, hardly any of Turkish airlines staff on ground level can speak fluent English!. I wasn't to assured by his statement. No one in the Airport was helpful and wished to direct or instruct us in what can be done etc. These guys have no customer service or communication skills whatsoever. Just for a few mins of lack of management caused me and my family to wait another 12 hours for the next flight with no consideration about children at all. We was sent to hotel very late to get 2 hours rest with no food or drink and to top it off no luggage with us. Turkish airlines also lost my baby stroller which did not come out of with our baggage so I have had to fill out a form which mentioned someone will be in touch in 24-48 hours and no calls whatsoever and its been 6 days.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | On a recent â€˜round-tripâ€™ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didnâ€™t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. Iâ€™m a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this wonâ€™t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new. In flight entertainment is typically pretty good.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through. This is easily the worst travel experience of my life yet.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | The ground staff were very nice and polite. However, the flight was slightly delayed and for 35 wheelchair passengers there were only 5 people to push them, slowing the boarding process even more at Pearson. The lines were chaos during boarding at Pearson. People did not even stay in systematic lines and they were just \"hogging\" to board like a crowd and the ground staff didn\\'t do anything about it. But thankfully they could announce star alliance gold and business passengers first. At least I could get a lot of space to put my bag. The inflight service was excellent. Excellent selection of movies for a 10 hour flight to Istanbul, delicious and well-presented food, clean bathrooms and prompt staff. When my inflight entertainment system froze during the flight, a flight crew promptly responded and fixed it. Same with when I asked for tea mid-flight. However, the wifi was really bad, it didn\\'t work at all. The cabin crew were very friendly. The same applies with the connecting inflight service till Mumbai. However, the boarding was a lot better at Istanbul, as we could thankfully board from the aerobridge than the bus. Overall, I enjoyed the experience on Turkish Airlines and would love to fly with them again.',\n",

The assistant at the desk told us we couldnâ€™t get seats and his only explanation was â€˜this flight is horribleâ€™ and refused to give any further explanation. He gave us â€˜standbyâ€™ boarding passes. At the boarding gate we were put aside and made wait for everyone else to get on board. There were 7 people in our situation and among them a pregnant lady that was treated with absolutely no respect! Since there was no one giving up the flight we had to stay and fly on the next day because we were sold tickets that didn't exist. We had bought this reservation for more than a month before the flight and suddenly they tell us there is no place for us? A Company has to make sure everyone is seated and flies at the time and date they reserved. Overbooking generates a lot of serious consequences.\",\n",

Until I got stuck for two days at IST airport during the military coup 2 years ago. But that's a different story altogether. I now tried Turkish Airlines again on a business trip to Singapore and could not believe how much the airline has changed to the worse. The planes on all 4 legs return was old and worn (don't know the type), old and smelly blankets, the food was by far not what it used to be, uncomfortable seats, totally unorganized transit lanes through customs, which nearly caused me to miss the onward flight. Staff was nice and friendly though. Unfortunately, I have already booked another business trip to Shanghai in July, but this will be the last one with Turkish Airlines.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | I recently flew Turkish Airlines (to/from South Africa via Istanbul), and upon boarding my return flight Johannesburg to Houston via Istanbul and due to their gate security not recognizing my paperwork, I was denied entry onto my flight. Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, â€œthere is a phone and computer, google your help.â€\\x9d I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person. I am sorry Turkish Airlines, even though the flight experience was decent, with edible food, drink and entertainment, the manner in which you treated me is beyond appalling.',\n",

FAs need to improve their English which is surprisingly poor given the airline\\'s global reach. Almost without fail, each time I asked for a drink \"full of ice\" and motioned with my hands to show a glass brimming with ice, I got a drink without any ice at all. Other interactions with crew were found to be lacking given low English proficiency. The cockpit announcement on the IST-VIE sector was almost completely unintelligible. Food was fairly good, but no better than QR or a number of other carriers. On the return, IST-IAD, a very rude passenger in 3E (I was in 4K) began berating me when I dared to use the overhead bin above his seat which was directly across from my seat. All other bins were full with either bedding for the sleep service or other pax\\'s luggage. He shouted at me \"Why are you using my bin\", to which I replied, \"it isn\\'t your bin, it is for business class passengers\". He continued to berate me.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some donâ€™t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600â‚¬ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didnâ€™t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just donâ€™t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They donâ€™t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They donâ€™t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, thatâ€™s just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldnâ€™t be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected, I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again. Worst airline I have ever taken!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Beijing to Istanbul. TK uses a third party to handle their ground formalities in Beijing and need to be aware of the terribly rude and substandard service by check-in and gate agents. My check-in was processed by an agent who was abrupt and surly who conversed with a colleague throughout the check-in process. At the gate we were told there was a 30 minute delay although none of the monitors showed it. As with most departures in China boarding was chaotic with priority lanes being used by all passengers. The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airlineâ€™s fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading. For instance the captain referred to de-icing being completed in 5 minutesâ€™ time when no de-icing equipment were in sight. Overall it was a mediocre to OK flight.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Gatwick to Antananarivo via Istanbul. Never again. The food was disgraceful on the outward flight. I was bumped from my seat, despite having pre booked it 5 months previously. On arrival my suitcase had one wheel missing, only the lining prevented the contents from spilling out. I obtained a damage report and tried to visit the Turkish Airlines office in the airport twice during my stay. Never open. Before boarding for the return flight I tried to get the airline to at least cover my suitcase with a plastic wrapping. They were beyond insolent. On arrival at Gatwick the other wheel was missing. I went to the Turkish Office and they said a new case would be delivered to my home address in a week. Over 2 weeks and still no sign. Instead multiple emails requesting I fill out forms I have given all the evidence requested. Still no compensation, prevarication all the time emails that one canâ€™t reply to. Turkish Airlines have ruined my case, it is irreparable.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Tehran via Istanbul. I had one of my worst experience (if not the worst) with Turkish Airlines. I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with. The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing. My experience couldn't be worse.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Booked to fly Turkish Airlines from Madrid to Alexandria via Istanbul. Worst flight service of my past 5 years. I chose this flight specifically due to its catchy price and most importantly short transit time as I have a family with 1 year old son. Flight from Madrid was delayed by 5 hours (flew 11.30 pm instead of 6.15 pm) since it was not possible to catch my connection flight they booked me the next trip 12.55 pm (an extra night and almost 9 hours transit time). Arrived into Istanbul and my baby was extremely tired, asked Turkish information desk for a place to spend the night but a rude employee told me go to the public restrooms. They were extremely uncomfortable so I went back and asked again, this time they gave me 5 hours lounge stay where again it was impossible to sleep. Overall a horrible nightmare experience. Rude employees who don't have any ideas on how to satisfy a customer.\",\n",

After avoiding them for a few years I decided to try them again, though if I had read the reviews here I would not have. Same experience, impressive website not quite working. I booked my ticket entering my United FF number noticing it kept adding the TK airline code. Then I saw they offered chauffeur driven service for pick up and drop off. I could only get to it after logging into my TK miles & smiles account. After lengthy email exchange I was told my one way business class ticket for > 2,000 $ was too cheap for this that is still ok but very low. I noticed my record showed my TK ff number, which I do not use as I collect bonus miles on UA. So on Checking in BKK I verified they had my US number they confirmed and even read it back to me. In ISt I noticed my TK account has miles deposited so I emailed, no reply. : After arrival I again noticed TK had deposited the miles obviously I lost all my gold bonus.: So I called TK - what a nightmare to even find a phone number and a person. They were initial quite abrupt and unwilling to help. A few days later I blunt rejection letter there was nothing they could do My response.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Tel Aviv via Istanbul was on time, as were 4 segments of my itinerary. Cabin staff solicitous ,helpful and polite. Catering out of JFK was particularly good, the onboard \"chefs\" a nice touch even if they really aren\\'t preparing much fresh food. We were seated on the side, 2 abreast, which was good as the center section of 3 across does not look appealing. The seats are relatively open, not affording much privacy, but the amount of storage is more than very sufficient, and the seat comfort when in the flat position, including the \"bedpad\", comforter and pillow more than adequate. The lounge in Istanbul was quite good, being on two levels with many interesting and well prepared food stations. We were also given two private sleeping rooms in the lounge for our 5 hour transit, a very nice touch. All in all, Turkish seems to offer a solid business class product, superior to US airlines in staff attitude, on time performance, speed of baggage delivery and overall efficiency.',\n",

The business seats are side by side lie flats and not the more modern individual spaces found on most long-haul airlines. So, privacy is an issue. The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling. They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked? This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer.',\n",

And I (Business class traveller and Elite Gold member) have a very long list of stories of very poor services. 1) 8 days today and I am without my only checked in bag during my flight to Houston and Turkish Airlines simply not doing anything except sending a message every few days saying they are investigating. I have no clothes for 8 days and Turkish Airlines are refusing even to compensate me for the lost bag. 2) When we changed our travel date due to a medical emergency supported by a letter from the hospital, Turkish Airlines charged me and my wife 1200 extra dollars per ticket and refused to waive any fees due to the medical emergency like all other reputable airlines. 3) On a number of occasions I missed my connections due to late arrival to Istanbul (on Turkish Airlines) and Turkish Airlines refused to take any resposibility for missing my meetings by flying me on a different airlines flight. This is happening to business class travellers, imagine if you fly economy. Very poor Airline.\",\n",

Cabin staff functioned well with announcements in Turkish, Russian and English. A good lunch was served with appropriate sized portions. IFE had a fair selection of films available. Istanbul to Manila a fair flight. Dinner was served at the beginning of the flight and chef did not present any alternatives when the main course that I wanted was not available so I slept and woke up relatively early. I had an early breakfast (this was quite adequate, although I would have liked a little more given no dinner the previous night). No further food was offered. I think that the airline would be better off allowing passengers going straight to sleep and then having breakfast and lunch as the two meals on this long flight.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston. Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable. The staff are rude and inhumane, Ataturk airport is chaotic and Turkish Airlines does not care about its passengers regardless of if you're flying business class or economy.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx Â£120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx Â£230 for my extra bag. Â£110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price? Shame on them.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Guangzhou. One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning. Kind of baffled I inquired a few times again but somehow this multi-billion company kept insisting that breaching the contract with their customers was business as usual for them. Can't really do anything else then to warn as many people as possible not to trust this airline.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The first time I flew with Turkish Airlines and it was a disappointment. My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane. In conclusion, this was really a bad experience.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Tel Aviv to New York via Istanbul. Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags. Avoid Turkish connecting flights if you cann!\",\n",

I was very impressed with the on board product, nice seats with reasonable legroom, very friendly staff, excellent food and also excellent in-flight entertainment. The kids received toys from the stewardess (on both flights) and were happy the entire time. Connecting in Istanbul was OK, very crowded and gate logistics not very efficient, but understandable due to the small terminal from where we were shuttled to the plane with a bus. We did not check our bags and the staff were vocal on giving priority to overhead compartment for larger bags which suited us perfectly, this is something other airlines should think of. All in all a very pleasant trip with both departures on time and a solid performance of the airline. We will certainly choose Turkish for our next trip if possible.',\n",

Time for a visit to the modest SAS Lounge (being Star Gold status) where there was a selection of light bites and drinks perfectly adequate for a pre-flight snack. Orderly boarding with priority boarding well handled. Inside the aircraft I first noticed the small size of the individual seat-back screens. But obviously airlines canâ€™t just throw them all away when bigger and better ones come along. Hot meal served in flight - with a choice of two entrees and various drinks. Delay landing in Istanbul due to congestion - hopefully a thing of the past when the new airport opens. Bus to the terminal. Long queue for the Biz class immigration desk. To the right of it is a channel serving a continual line of Turkish Airlines crew. I donâ€™t understand why the crew dont use the two adjacent but always empty Beogs electronic immigration gates, hence freeing up a second line for the high revenue fare paying passengers. Even after the queue there was a wait for the luggage to come up. Overall a good flight and thanks to the fare I found online, extremely good value.

This flight from Istanbul to Berlin was full and despite being crammed boarding was quick and the catering on board efficient as always. Although a rather short trip you still have your on board entertainment system which nobody on European schedules has in addition to the meal choice. Knowing quite a few airlines and using them in various cabin classes and routes I can not understand how they can only score 6 out of 10.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good! Disembarkation at CPT was quick, immigration was a breeze and we collected our bags just 10 minutes after landing. Overall, we were impressed and we're actually looking forward to our return flights.\",\n",

I had to phone several times (sometimes with long waits and difficult communication in English)) to reserve seats in a business class. Fully flat bed seats were comfortable but food service was disorganized. Very pleasant staff was running back and forth with individual dishes and glasses in very inefficient fashion. The major problem for us occurred in the Istanbul business class lounge. Our wait time between the flights was 10 hours, and we expected to be able to use their sleeping rooms for at least several hours. To our surprise we were informed that we are not eligible because the rule is that only customers with a wait time 3-7 hours are eligible! We pleaded to let us stay for a shortened period to no avail. After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked. So we spent next 10 hours in a noisy crowded business lounge, with tables and floors overflowing with dirty dishes, cutlery, napkins and empty bottles and cans.',\n",

However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world). I gave only 3 for seat comfort but it must be said that it is always painful for me to travel on airline seats.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | One of the worst flying experiences. First, my flight took off four hours after schedule and we were stuck in the aircraft. This delay meant a missed connection. There was no one from Turkish Airlines to help or assist. After visiting several counters, waiting for hours, I was given new boarding card for a flight 24 hours later. They did not provide any meal and when I asked for a hotel they made me pay for the visa. The next day they asked me to be ready to go to the airport but they did not come and pick me up. Hotel management contacted the airline and they said I should keep waiting. An hour before the flight time, I decided to take a taxi. Due to a flight delay, I managed to catch my flight. On arrival, I found my luggage broken and the handling agent was not interested in even seeing the luggage but he did write a report.',\n",

After booking my ticket and requesting a wheelchair at the airports - no matter how many times I have called, e-mailed and even personally asked at the counter, they just simply chose to either ignore or they are so disorganized that they simply forgot. I can not understand how it can be possible in such a competitive climate to be as inefficient and unreliable. There were no personnel from the airlines waiting for me in Istanbul on either journeys (to and back from Singapore to Kosice). I have problems walking and it is really necessary for me to have someone help me when transferring via airports. I gave Turkish Airlines a shot and I have to say, I don't think I will be flying them again.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | 15 Dec, Chicago - Istanbul, Turkish Airlines business class. Check-in was very quick at ORD airport with kind and very polite agent. Boarding was in order and a separate boarding line for Business class and Elite members. On board was greeted with a warm welcome. Pre takeoff had a glass of Champagne which was perfectly chilled and really enjoyed. Push back was on time. Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course. Had ordered special meal AVML (Asian vegetarian meal). I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from. The only complaint I have is, that they do not come and ask or refill the drink you are enjoying. I suggest they should improve this. Again I will be flying on TK business class end of March this year.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Montreal. Everyone was boarding at the same time (No grouping, no priority), and as the plane was full boarding took quite some time. Plane was new (3 years old) and had 2-4-2 layout. Seat itself was okay, comparable to other long-haul flights I've taken. Legroom was good, I'm 6 foot and I had no problems. Food and drink service was amazing, we were first handed packs of peanut followed by a drink service, then dinner. The food was really good, and was filling for one person. Drinks were provided throughout the flight. IFE was good, and there were plenty of films and series. One complaint is that there were some random episodes of some TV Series (like Season 4 Episode 5-6-7 of a series). Crew was helpful and unlike other Turkish Airlines flights I've taken, they were able to have an actual conversation in English. I bought in flight WiFi (for 14.99$US) and it worked well throughout the flight.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Napoli to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The worst experience ever. Two hours flight delayed missing connection flight to Perth. Stuck in the airport for more than 30hr. I took with my partner on the 17 January 2018 at 19:00 a Turkish airline flight from Napoli to Perth with connection flight in Istanbul and Kuala Lumpur. The flight left the city of Napoli 30 min late. Once we landed in Istanbul me and my partner quickly went to check the connection flight time which was also affected by 30 min delay. Once onboard of the flight TK60 of 18 Jan 2018 at 2:25 the plane was not full of passenger yet. At 2:35 the captain announced that we had to wait 15 min for more passenger to arrive that then turned into 45 minutes. We end up leaving at 3:45 and due to this late departure we also had to wait for seven planes to take off before us. On board me and my partner have been asking several times to the staff for the connection flight from Kuala Lumpur but all the cabin crews including the manager seems to donâ€™t know much about the situation and didnâ€™t really care. On late arrival in KL at 18:30 we miss our connecting flight with Malindo airline and ground staff told us we were on next morning flight and that hotel and transports have been arranged. The next day we went back to the airport at 5:30am just to find out that we were not on the flight at 8:45 am and the staff of Malindo knew nothing of our situation. We have been stuck here in the airport ever since to wait for a Turkish airline representative.',\n",

I cannot find words to describe their \"customer service\" and should anything go wrong during the trip you are left alone.

It took me 2.5 hours at the transfer desk and stories I cannot even describe to get a ticket to return back to London as there was no other flight to my destination until the day after. I had a business class ticket, however when I went to the gate I was told they had overbooked the business class cabin and I would have to be downgraded to economy.

Candlelight dinner was a clever idea, but wine choice was very poor, 2-3-2 seating in business is not good, especially the middle seat. Amenities pack was poor, Bentley and Furla. The downsides to me were the zoning of seats it was a free for all. Some staff were rude MIA to IST, asking if my wife was in the right seat? Stop economy passengers walking into business to use the restrooms, this was common to all flights. The in flight entertainment did not work in row 5, it was a full flight, so to be without for 12 hours was a nightmare, staff just shrugged shoulders. Case arrived broken in Munich - Delsey Hard Case, that was wrapped so did not see until unpacking. So would I use again, well 70% as price was keen.',\n",

The flights were on time, inflight catering was excellent, the leg space in economy has slightly improved, the English proficiency of the crew has greatly improved, and the inflight entertainment has vastly improved and is easy to use. The service of the crew was excellent. My mother in law who was traveling with us can only consume liquids and requested if she could could get some milk to drink. Instead the crew brought her soup from business class and then came back a little bit later with some more. Truly above and beyond service on their part. The only thing though is the USB ports did not fully work in all of the seats which was annoying, and I wish they did not do away with the delicious Turkish food which used to be served. But all in all Turkish Airlines is worth every penny, and I do not regret choosing them back in 2007 as my international airline of choice.\",\n",

As the carry on exceeded the 8 kilos permitted cabin weight, I paid the extra fee and checked in the carry on as well. However, when landed in Tehran, I realized that the carry on's tagging number was not even issued at the boarding desk and my carry on was lost. I filled in the application form at lost and found office in Tehran and have called the Turkish airlines at Munich airport several times so far, but after 10 days still haven't received any answer. As I do not even have a baggage tag number for my carry on, I cannot even claim for compensation. What I am wondering is, even if the check-in clerk forgets to hand over the baggage tag, why can't they try to check what was the number of the checked in carry-on as all the information are recorded and kept in the system. I am extremely disappointed as this has kind of ruined my holiday.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | It was my first time flying Turkish Airlines from Geneva to Jakarta via Istanbul. I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff donâ€™t even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it. The seat was acceptable, and the entertainment system good (some other airlines have more choices, but it was good enough for me), I liked the controlller than can be used as a screen, and the headsets. I could have taken Emirates for $500 more.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Medina to Lahore via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines service is one of the poorest. I and my wife were made to sit at the airport during a 14 hours stopover at IST on 4th December. To add insult to injury, 2 of 3 baggage pieces remain missing to date. Our transit time at IST was around 14 hrs. When approached the service counter at Istanbul they gave us only one snack (one slice of pizza for each passenger) voucher. I asked her where to stay for full day transit. She said anywhere at the airport and went back to her mobile phone chat. In between, she was chatting with a male colleague and didn't seem to have time to pay attention to customer. She worked more like a machine than a human in only giving vouchers with out speaking to customers. Upon complaint they tried to cover its inefficiency and poor service by saying that â€œNo request can be traced at their hotel desk on ISTâ€\\x9d. How will there be a record if TK staff misleads the customers away. Nobody (TK ticket sales office at Lahore airport) had informed us the time of ticketing to request a hotel in advance during transit at IST. TK said that we didn't request a hotel.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight. The service and cabin staff were excellent, even on the old A330!\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight. If they decided to add WiFi on all aircraft, it might really annoy the competition.\",\n",

TK seems to have kept their high quality in catering (Do & Co): full hot meals provided with drinks, very tasty meals. The cabin crews were hard working on both flights and the lady purser on TK1761 was a real star: very warm, friendly and extremely patient with the same unruly passengers who jumped up to the aisle every time the seat belt sign went on in heavy turbulence. Quite annoying but handled with care by the purser and the cabin crew on TK1761. Good quality and great value, will book again.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | Flew business class, TK35 Istanbul to Montreal on Dec 08 2017. I must emphasize the amazing lounge in Istanbul. No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isnâ€™t Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lotâ€™s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly. Not so on Turkish!',\n",

Was told to call back two weeks later which I did and then I was told to call back again. I did. Then I was told that I must get a refund at a Turkish Airlines sales office, there are only 2 in the entire US. I complained and was told to call back. Now I am told that I can get a \"refund\" after cancellation and \"no-show\" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket. Apparently, they are only granting full refunds if you depart from the US. This is an absolute sham and seems set up to make the system frustrating to navigate so they can mitigate their losses.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada. It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: â€œReissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didnâ€™t see was the fine print at the bottom: â€œTurkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.â€\\x9d. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered â€œI canâ€™t accept thisâ€\\x9d. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day. Turkish Airlines is different. This is truly a horrible company with mean spirited employees.\",\n",

I didn't mind getting hotel but they gave me lot of trouble just to give little information about the visa. I was wondering from one counter to another counter just to get right information. Staffs at the airport were the rudest people I ever met. Even the visa officers at the counter didn't give me correct information instead they yelled and behaved in a very rude way. I couldn't get hotel because I and my kids had American passport and they don't issue visa from the airport to the American. My question to the Turkish Airlines is that why they didn't mention that while I brought the ticket why they issued ticket to the American passport? I went to Turkish Airlines counter may be four time finally I got the correct answer. Staffs at the Turkish Airlines counter were also very very rude just as other staff at the airport.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Trip Verified | My first flights (Jakarta to Antalya via Istanbul). On the homebound flight from Antalya to Jakarta via Istanbul my TK 2425 (30 Nov 2017) was delayed without any announcement. On boarding I asked the ground crew if I would still be able to catch my Istanbul-Jakarta flight (TK56), and the ground crew replied that \"no problem\". The plane landed late and I missed my flight to Jakarta. Yes, Turkish airline did give me a hotel, yes, Turkish airline did give me a ticket rebooking, yes Turkish airline did give me breakfast-lunch-dinner. However, I did not receive my luggage and hence I did not have any change of clothes. Upon seeing the queue at the Turkish Airlines hotel transfer I was in a dilemma of either waiting another 2 hours before getting my luggage at 4am or go sleep at the hotel and not have my luggage. In my luggage was also my laptop charger and mobile charger which I would have needed to inform work, arrangements that I will be delayed by one day. But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed. I was appalled by the ground crew at Antalya airport who lied to my face, and the ground crew at the hotel transfer who did not sympathize that I needed my luggage and only offered strict options. I was very dissapointed that Turkish airline did not provide me a letter of delay to help me justify my situation at my home country, and no laundry service hence I was not in fresh clothes for more than 48hrs! It is easy providing hotels, food and ticket change but please keep in mind that all these passengers are humans and have lives and dependencies and have specific needs and requirements.',\n",

There was a good selection of movies in various different languages. The same applies to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Mumbai, but the cabin crew were a lot nicer.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Trip Verified | Being a loyal customer of this airline, I was once again dissapointed with Turkish Airlines completely messing up my flight. Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care. It's a shame, since their planes and prices are very nice, the headache in dealing with the problems afterwards is just too much to fly with them again.\",\n",

When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldnâ€™t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open. After check-in, Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour. At boarding time we were escorted to the gate and given immediate boarding. Before take-off given menus and was asked to complete my breakfast choices. After take-off breakfast was served. I had ordered scrambled eggs but when they reached me in row Four, they said they had all gone. They offered an omelette or waffles',\n",

We waited till boarding time and proceeded to board when gate was open. No announcement was made of gate changes. My daughter passed through the gate (204) and was about to board the plane when I was withheld due to the boarding gate having been changed. The fact that my daughter was let through to the plane shows a lack of security by the ground crew at the gate, which is not acceptable. Then we were informed to proceed to gate 306. At gate 306, we were instructed to proceed to gate 315 but the plane left by then. We complained to customer service and were asked to purchase another ticket!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to New York with Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively painless considering it was at a very early hour of the morning. Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant. On board, the aircraft looked newish with 2x2x2 configuration in business class. The FA's were pleasant, friendly and professional in the conduct of their duties although they did not intervene when the passenger behind me stood up while the aircraft was taxiing. We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue. The wifi worked well and the IFE had a decent selection although it could have used more recent movie releases. Flight departed and arrived on time and was a good experience overall.\",\n",

Mashhad to Istanbul delayed and as a result of this and due to very unhelpful airport staff (not Turkish Airlines) we missed our connecting flight and had to board the next flight, arriving in London 5 hours later than originally planned. Our bags delayed by about 5 days. All this to the side, Turkish Airlines processed our claim within 7 days, I had to only send a single email and full compensation was paid.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore via Istanbul. FRA-IST then 2.5h layover and IST-SIN. The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn\\'t arrive in Singapore. It\\'s missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline\\'s website claims \"Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents.\". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it\\'s 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It\\'s as bad a website as I\\'ve ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn\\'t state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like \"On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use â€œold versionâ€\\x9d or â€œnew versionâ€\\x9d I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of â€“ why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesnâ€™t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, thereâ€™s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Very good experience in total! Extremely good seats from Copenhagen to Istanbul. When entering the plane we saw that it was 2+2 seats with good space and an IFE even if it was only a 2.50 hr flight. Was served a simple meal which was enough. Had a layover of 3.15 hr in Istanbul and went to the lounge. From all reviews the lounge was highlighted as something positive. I would say the lounge needs a refresh. Worn seats, crowded, closed food places, etc.. Not at all what I had in my mind. You could of course drink unlimited liquor. Istanbul to Antananarivo was the best Business travel ever. Very responsive personnel and called you by name. The IFE had a good selection but the Denom headset was not noice cancelling! The boarding was chaotic. No organisation whatsoever.

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to London. My comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself. There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.\",\n",

Check in was very quick we checked in 3 large suitcases with our 80kgs combined allowance we also had two carry on trolley cases a rucksack and suit holder asked if we could check in the rucksack to save dragging it around with us even though we were on the check in limit, yes sir no problem. Spent time in the business class lounge to wait for boarding. Arrived at the boarding gate checked through boarded the plane first. Flight London to Istanbul was 4 hours approx, seat was very comfortable flight attendants very good and spoke perfect English. There was a chef who came round and took our order for our meal. The food was excellent. IFE was good but not great could do with upgrading but acceptable. We arrived in Istanbul on time and were bussed to the terminal business class passengers were off the plane first and had there own bus. we had about two hours. so spent time in the Turkish Airlines Lounge then headed to our gate to board our plane for Manila. this is the only fault I found with this trip. There was no business class priority boarding just everybody trying to to get through the check in and only one member of staff checking tickets and passports absolutely ridiculous it was mayhem finally got through the check in and were last to board a waiting bus (I would not have liked to be first on the bus) to take us to the aircraft. We were welcomed on board by the flight attendants and given a pre flight drink and our suit holder was hung up for us. The seats were comfortable and spacious and turned into a flatbed with the ottoman at the foot and for once I actually slept during the flight which is a rarity for me. The IFE was the same as mentioned before Our section of the business cabin had 28 seats which less than half were occupied. Flight attendants were very attentive spoke perfect English. The chef came round asked to fill out a menu card for our breakfast at the end of our flight and also took our order for our meal again it was a fantastic meal the best we have had in the air. We were a little late taking off from Istanbul for our 12 hour flight but still arrived at Manila 1 hour early. We were first off the plane through immigration got to the carousel to pick our luggage our 4 bags because of the priority tags were in the first 10 bags we were out of Manila airport 25 minutes after getting off the plane. Our return trip was just as good if not better as the boarding situation for the London flight at Istanbul was much better organised. Would I use this airline again, most definitely.',\n",

By 11 am the hotel told them to check out. She left hotel and took taxi back to the airport. Only business class was take care of. We spent another 5 hours in the airport waiting for some news. At 5 pm they opened check in for another flight. After all this long upsetting time the new flight got delayed again! For another 1,5 hours.

I opted for vegetarian meal as I cannot tolerate spicy food, only to receive Ratatouille made with chili sauce and a stuffed chilli for breakfast. I could not get the TV monitor out from the side of the seat, and my request for help was ignored. Same thing happened with my husband with his TV monitor. Return trip - very hot plane and our request for extra water with ice was ignored. Staff were sullen and unresponsive - both inflight and at Artatuk Airport. Needless to say, will not be using this airline again. Have written to complain, to date - no reply.',\n",

We were sent to the cashiering department and asked to pay $950 per person for a flight that was 1.5 hour long and listed online for $120 dollars per person.

The hard product is comfortable but lacks privacy due to 2x2x2 configuration of the business class cabin which means no direct aisle access for all seats. The FA's were pleasant and professional although their English was not very good. Food quality was average and below their historical standards. Toilets were kept reasonably clean and tidy throughout the journey. IFE had many choices but list of films needed an update with very few recent releases. Flight left on time and arrived a full hour ahead of schedule. The disembarkation via buses remains a total nuisance and mystery as there were plenty of vacant air bridges. Overall a decent experience but the business class product is inferior to the Gulf and Southeast Asian carriers.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively quick and efficient. Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route. This was despite vacant air bridges. Overall it was a good experience but TK has to reverse the downward trend in their catering quality and return to the high standards they used to have.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce. We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly?',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Cluj-Napoca to Singapore via Istanbul and it was one of the best flight experiences so far. You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight. All in all, very happy with the airline, their call center (which I used to reserve my seats) and would gladly fly with them again. .\",\n",

On top we had to pay for 3 visas to stay in Istanbul (total $90). We were told that we will get reimbursed for visas, so upon our return I started requesting reimbursement. We were granted our reimbursement, however to get your money you have to go to their \"closest sales office\" - well guess what, for me it is a 2 hour drive! They refused to mail a check for deposit, so now i am out $90 and had a terrible flight all because of no fault of mine.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul. My wife and I were traveling with twins in business class, and her family was also on the plane but traveling in economy class. As we got to the boarding gate, we wanted to get the rest of our family onto business class. There were seats available, but the first person we asked said it was impossible to change seats at such a late time. I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class. The reason this is so impressive is that he had to go against the inbuilt systems to delight a customer. I think the airline industry needs more staff like him and less people who just follow the process. I will be flying Turkish airlines again because of this.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | London to Mombasa via Istanbul, after being told and having my ticket verified by a lady agent at the international transit desk just before passport control that i qualify for a free transit hotel for a layover as my transit time was 18hours. I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldnâ€™t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.',\n",

The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapÃ©s, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley. Toilets were kept in reasonably good state throughout the flight. The wifi was good and operated without interruption. The flight left late but landed on schedule. Overall it was a decent experience but the decline in catering quality was very obvious.\",\n",

Even more impressed with the live television services, though limited channels. I would not have imagined watching a UEFA Champions League / World Cup qualifier game whilst travelling intercontinental. Food is good relative to other airlines. Was relieved that my check-in luggage made it through to Kuala Lumpur, after there was a 50 minutes delay from my departure at Heathrow. At Istanbul, I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate. Made it into the connection to Kuala Lumpur, but was resigned that my luggage wouldn't make it and may come in on the following flight. Thankfully, it reached KUL together with me. One reservation about the hardproduct is seat pitch, especially on the A330. I'm 6 foot 1, and really feel the tightness.

On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.\",\n",

I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FAâ€™s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (â€œDevonâ€\\x9d). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze â€“ I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles. Only 6 seats were occupied (out of 20) on this morning flight. IFE also good.',\n",

The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board. If they did, they would be quite perfect.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | For my vacation to Turkey I decided to fly with Turkish Airlines instead of a charter airline like SmartWings. We boarded an A321-200 in Prague, seats were really nice with really good pitch and each seat has personal IFE which is geat for a 2 hours flight. The headphones were not very good, but thats ok. Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again. The A321 was really nice and IFE for 2 hours flight is great, it is just the crew that could be little bit better.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Brussels via Istanbul. Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more. No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid. When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright. We just did not understand why on a night flight it took so long to get your meal after the take off. It would be nice to get it earlier and then get some more time to sleep.\",\n",

I felt that the entertainment screen is quite small, it is adequate but would be great if we could enjoy larger screen size. Food options were satisfying and presentation was nice thanks to Do&Co catering. It would be great if they offer flexibility to their pax to be able to opt to dine whenever they wish (not only in a designated meal service time). This is particularly for the red-eye flight like Sao Paulo-Istanbul which depart at 3am and a meal was served just after take off. Cabin crew polite and courteous especially Indonesian-bound flight. Lounge at Istanbul was great with many food selections but much fewer when you departing late at night. One most point that need to be improved is the boarding arrangement at the Departure Gate especially for Business Class Passengers ! There was indeed a special Line for business class pax but mostly were blocked by the long economy pax queue that we had to struggle to find the dedicated line for business class pax.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Flying Turkish Airlines is always a good if not great experience regardless of what class you are flying. But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city. Bottom line, best customer service I have ever had. Keep doing what you are doing Turkish Airlines!',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to \"write me up\" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service. I was disappointed by this attitude and treatment.',\n",

Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted! We were taken by bus to the domestic terminal and all in all 30 minutes delay. I have not had a delayed Turkish Airlines flight for months so not a big deal for me.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Brussels to Entebbe via Istanbul. Our train was delayed, but we arrived at the airport 80 minutes before our scheduled flight. The check-in area was very busy and confusing with several queues. We waited in the queue for 25 minutes to find out that we had been standing in the wrong queue, as there were two flights to Istanbul that day at similar times. We came to the check-in counter when the lady informed us that we are at the wrong counter and we are too late and check-in is already over. She then directed us to the Turkish Airline counter but he told us that he cannot help us. We pointed out that we only have two small carry-on bags and all we need is a boarding pass (and we still had 50 minutes to departure). He refused with a smirk adding that that's not his problem. We ended up spending thousands of Euros for our new tickets, paying for a hotel, and changing the schedule of our trip and all of it was unnecessary. We understand that there are strict airline policies and passengers need to arrive to check-in on time. All we needed was for someone to issue us tickets.\",\n",

The check in was efficient and fast, there was a special clearance lane for Turkish Airlines passengers (different to the normal fast track for other airlines and this lane fed straight into the lounge). The plane was a little late taking off and there seemed to be no hurry with the meal service, a pity as I would rather have slept straight away and just had breakfast. The food and wine on the plane was good. The bed was comfortable and I slept well.

Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue. Felt much more comfortable on the 10+ hour Istanbul to Boston leg with my back-pack stored above me rather than under the seat in front of me. Also got a great price by ordering the ticket 4+ months in advance, though did have to pay extra for flight insurance.',\n",

The lounge they use at Dublin is the worst experience. No recognition of business class passengers - we pay for this experience, but it is non existent. Narrowbody business class seating not overly comfortable, especially when in the recline position, especially the leg rest or lack of leg rest. Poor in flight service, feeling of being a burden to the cabin staff, despite only 50% occupation on business class cabin. IFE screen malfunction, poor response from crew and no offer of seat change. Not worth the extra fare for business class as there was a total lack of experience. I submitted feedback and received a response from them that did not address the basis of the feedback.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to London via Istanbul. First leg from Bangkok was an A330. Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR. The process of getting PED's was almost as cumbersome as getting them checked in but TK staff did their best to return devices as quickly as possible.\",\n",

I purchased an economy ticket and tried to use my miles (from another airline within Star Alliance) to upgrade one segment of the flight. Simple? Not at all. I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes. Then I upgraded the ticket using my miles, but was then told that the upgrade would change the code to an I. Code I does means that I get no miles for the flight even though I paid full price for the ticket. I tried to contact Turkish Airlines through their website and received no reply. I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me. Then they tried to charge me a reissuing fee for their mistake. Then I tried to upgrade again and couldn't online so I contacted them (this time by phone) and was told that their system was down and they couldn't do anything.\",\n",

And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either. Oh and they don't charge sports baggage fees as a single trip return, they charge for each destination where you stop / layover, both there and back, so you could pay up to 90 euros one way,and the same return.\",\n",

There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members. The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board. Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals. I have flown with them a few times and nothing has been on show or shown in the menu.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul. TK1980/TK0064. Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as â€œsalad and steakâ€\\x9d it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less. Overall a good flight, worth recommending if the price point is right.',\n",

Check-in slower than normal for priority lane on account of extra layer of checks for flights bound for North America. Boarding by zone numbers and quite orderly. On board, the hard product was a little weathered with scuff marks and torn trim. The flight left the gate 35 minutes late and there was no reason provided other than \"operational issues\". Once airborne, a 5-course lunch was served along with a wide range of drink choices. The food was quite tasty and well presented. The FA\\'s were warm, friendly and very attentive. A special mention goes out to the staff who looked after my side of the aisle with a permanent smile and cheery demeanour throughout the entire flight. The IFE had a good selection but was awkward to navigate at times. Tolilets needed attention and were not always clean / tidy. Flight landed 30 minutes late and for an unknown reason we disembarked via airside buses which is extremely rare for Montreal.

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | I was particularly looking forward to TK 1, my first trans-Atlantic business class experience. In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows. If Turkish Airlines can get control of the boarding experience, their business class service would be easily a 10.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': \"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Having had my original flight out of Montreal cancelled and rerouted through Toronto with a 24-hour delay, I was bracing for the worst. Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep. Toilets were kept clean throughout the journey. It was a pleasant experience on the balance and the cabin chief deserved special mention given how he handled my request to be moved to another seat.\",\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Turkish Airlines makes a real effort to give even their economy passengers a positive experience. Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience. My flight back to Turkey and the USA next week will be in business class, so I am looking forward to the award-winning premium service.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew. The French announcements from the cockpit were a nice touch. Flight departed late but arrived 40 minutes ahead of schedule.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | This almost 11 hour flight happened in a brand-new aircraft. On-board entertainment as well as the seats were just perfect. As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on. By the way, the short flight from Istanbul to Zurich (3 h) in an old aircraft was perfectly organized.',\n",

       "  'customer_review': 'âœ… Verified Review | Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I\\'ve witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the \"angled flat\" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you\\'ll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won\\'t come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I\\'m more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I\\'d fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation. A note of warning - unlike most Turkish long-haul aircraft which offer excellent wifi, this aircraft has no wifi, so you\\'d better enjoy reading.',\n",

I noticed they have improved their IFE with new functionalities. The food portions became a bit smaller on the European routes but bigger on intercontinental ones. Food quality was good. Generous choice of beverages but rounds could be more frequent. Both flights packed. Cabin crew nice on the first leg, way warmer on the longer segment. On the way to Singapore, due to traffic congestion at Istanbul airport, plane took off with a delay of one hour but landed in Singapore on-time. Toilets were kept clean and are now getting stocked with new nice amenities (flowers, high-quality hand lotions and hand cream) which on other airlines you would find on business class only. Seat pitch on the A330 is quite poor compared to the Boeing 777. As an Elite member, I could use on-board Wifi at no charge and the connection was stable and very good considering the altitude. Priority-tagged luggage was delivered in less than 15 minutes in Singapore. Gold lounge at Istanbul airport is superb.',\n",

The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it\\'s an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy.

Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see whatâ€™s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think itâ€™s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that thereâ€™s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didnâ€™t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because itâ€™s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they canâ€™t get it.

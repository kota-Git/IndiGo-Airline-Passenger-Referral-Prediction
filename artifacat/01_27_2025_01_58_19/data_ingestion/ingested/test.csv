American Airlines,1.0,S Meaken,25th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to New York via Los Angeles. Booked a seat, Oh no a ticket on the plane it was not a seat as I was told, even though you have to pay to get a better seat it's just still a ticket. Ordered Vegetarian for my daughter for return flights as she does not eat meat. On the way over they told her nothing was ordered and were the most rudest people to her about it, they offered her nothing to eat as an alternative and actually told her go and complain about it! So I called the office and let them know of their staffâ€™s rudeness and that on a 15 hour long haul flight she was starving! They ensured me that they had it arranged for the return flight and I also upgraded her seat to give her an exit row seeing she is tall to give her more leg room. Yes the meal this time was correct, the staff though were the same rude people, must be a trait for AA. But her seat was broken, - they offered her nowhere else to move told her once again go complain. I have since read so many bad reviews, that I wished I had read before making the booking. It was a special trip for my daughters birthday to NYC to see her sister. American Airlines Customer service is the worst she had ever encountered in her life she said, you should maybe put some money into training your staff if they are having a bad day, which seems to be every day do not take it out on your paying customers as they are the ones who will not return.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to New York via Los Angeles,October 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,2.0,W Jing,9th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Newark. The flight delayed for 7 hours because of waiting for aircraft. We had to fly with different airline to get to our destination on time to attend an important event. Furthermore, without notification, our seats on a return flight was automatically cancelled. As a result, we have to take a much later flight to go back home.

Qatar Airways,3.0,S Harding,26th May 2014,AUH-DOH-LHR return. 90 minutes delay at DOH waiting for late connections/congestion. Things will improve with the new airport opening 27th May 2014. The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. The system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory. Missed connections at DOH for myself and others and the horror of the Doha Airport transfer desk.

Jetblue Airways,2.0,M Gillot,13th July 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | JetBlue has become a horrible airline to fly with. On this four and a half flight there were several issues. I upgraded to more space seats for $170 because the airline strategically blocks off many of the seats so that you cannot sit with your spouse. There was no entertainment on this flight. The wifi did not work either. Apparently their entire systems were down according to the announcement. They would give you a $15 voucher IF you booked through them but would have to jump through hoops because the booking was done through Expedia. As soon as we took off the staff made an announcement that there were no sandwiches or salads available on this flight for sale. Thanks for letting us know after boarding. The plane itself was old and dirty. The seat was hard as a wood plank due to the foam material degrading. Also the cabin was freezing cold and had to spend $5 per blanket to keep warm because they would not increase cabin temperature. Worse flight I've taken in a while and that's saying something since I rarely complain.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Aruba to Boston,July 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Dennis Kloepper,6th July 2014,We recently took our family to Maui to celebrate our 48th anniversary. My husband is in his 70's as I am and he has Parkinson's disease. I have recently had a knee replacement so we rented a hotel for the park and fly program as did our daughter's family for a total of $475 so there would be no chance of us being late for our plane which was to leave at 10.35 am. We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus. To top this all off we are AA frequent flyers!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,4.0,Michael Collins,25th February 2014,My wife and I flew EK414 etd Dubai 0150 in January 2014. This is a direct flight Dubai to Sydney on the A380. The business seats on the Emirates A380 appear roomy until you actually sit in one when you realize that the arrangement of everything around you actually quite crowds you. The extension of the food and beverage tray leaves very little room to move. The bed is actually a flat bed but the shoulder room is too squashed even for the average sized person that I am. This made it difficult to get any reasonable sleep. The hostess insisted on keeping the shutters down for the full 14 hours of the flight as we travelled from night to day and then into the night. I think that this contributed to our very first experience of jet lag and we have done quite a bit of travelling. The business class bar is wasted space.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,no

Emirates,7.0,N Sutherland,5th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai with Emirates. Reasonable check in, in both Glasgow and Bangkok. All flights arrived pretty much on time, even if late in departing. Usual variable cabin crew with BKK routes so-so, but much more attentive crews on the Glasgow legs. Economy class food seems to be improving in recent years though I think the IFE choice of films is not as good as it was. No remote stand bussing in DXB which is an improvement. Good availability of flights and good prices which are the main reasons I choose Emirates, though they are now charging Â£20 per leg to preselect seats in advance of the 48hr online check-in window which I find ridiculous.",Boeing 777 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Glasgow to Bangkok via Dubai,February 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,9.0,S Sulkes,24th February 2015,12 hour flight TLV-JFK was excellent because of the crew. Upbeat polite couldn't do enough. Economy seating was fine and 3-3-3 configuration on 777 aircraft is very liveable for that duration. Dinner followed by as many sandwiches peanuts and pretzels as you can eat and as much as many beverages as you like all served with a smile both on request and on cabin pass throughs. Crew on this trip had seniority (I asked) and these were folks who understood the profession of customer service. Video on demand is top in class. A grade.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Faiz Eljunaid,6th September 2014,"We are a family of four. I travelled with Turkish Airlines Doha-Istanbul-Doha and booked seats online on row 6 on both flights. On check-in for the return flight TK-0782 on Sept. 2nd I was given seats on row 21! I talked to the check-in supervisor and she told me that the plane had been changed and the seat numbers are rearranged by the system and she can not do any thing about this. On boarding I was surprised to find that row 21 is a 4-seats row beside the exit with smaller tight and uncomfortable seats. There were some other passengers complaining about their seating as well. I talked to the flight dependant in-charge and he responded in an impolite way and giving instructions to return to our seats. I told him that I will report this online. He responded: ""Please do"" in a way that reflects ""I don't care""! It was a 4-hour flight and one of my terrible experiences in air travel.

Air New Zealand,4.0,T Huang,28th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Vancouver to Auckland with Air New Zealand. In summary, really cramped seats, movie selection was a nothing special, food was only average. The seats were so cramped that even I, an average build asian girl, felt squeezed. Which was not a great experience for a 14 hour flight. I would assume this is so because of the usual seat formation of 3-3-3 being converted into a 3-4-3 to maximize profits. Movie selection was a bit outdated, with movies from a couple of months ago. Food was almost tasteless to me, seems to be catering mostly to European tastes. Pricing was rather high for such a flight, considering that it was almost 20% more expensive to take this 14 hour flight compared to taking a flight from Vancouver to Singapore (which takes 18 hours). In conclusion, I'd believe taking this airline is not worth it.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to AKL,December 2016,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no
Alitalia,,Andrew Shrugs Hall,29th July 2014,Alitalia check in at Heathrow were superb but after that the whole experience was the worst we've ever experienced on a long haul flight. Staff in Rome airport were rude during our delayed connecting flight and when we eventually got onto the plane to Buenos Aires we all sat waiting in our seats for over an hour for the flight to commence no refreshments boiling hot and no explanation to what the delay was. Staff were indifferent to the passengers requests that's when they could be bothered to work. Finally the inflight entertainment to help us forget this nightmare was a disaster in as much the screen would randomly switch off during movies.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,Donna Bergquist,16th March 2019,"Not Verified | Pleasantly surprised. Flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Only one delay, which was expected, due to snowstorm in Boston. Delta communication regarding this delay was timely and accurate. I realized the evening I arrived home that I had left my Kindle in the seat pocket. The following day I opened a Lost Item Report with the airline. I did not have much hope that my Kindle would be found and returned. I received daily emails from Delta, and after 8 days the email stated that an item matching the one described by me was found. I followed the instructions for the item to be mailed to me. To my delight, I did receive my Kindle back and much quicker than stated in the emails! It is reassuring that an airline would take the time and effort to locate my Kindle and return it to me. This trip was my third in one month's time, the other 2 trips taken with a different major airline. Every one of those other trips resulted in at least a 2 1/2 hour delay for various reasons, some understandable and most not. Lack of communication from the other major airline, only one time was compensation offered, and each delay resulted in doubling the time it should have taken to travel to the destinations.

Aegean Airlines,8.0,K Bikos,12th June 2013,ATH to RHO on an A320-200. Boarding and take-off a bit late but nevertheless it arrived as expected to Rhodes airport. Cabin was clean and shinny and the crew very friendly and looking elegant in their (well designed) uniforms. Seats fairly comfortable and all leather dressed even in economy. One thing I don't like in Aegean aircraft cabins is the seat-plan which makes the cabin feel a bit crowded in fully booked flights. Snack and drink ok nothing special for a short flight but ok. Flight was nice and smooth landing was great. Overall a pleasant and comfortable flight.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Michael Schade,14th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Brussels to Singapore via Doha. Efficient check in at Bru airport, no priority security clearance for Qatar passengers. Qatar uses the BA lounge, which is rather basic. Boarding fast and organized. Seat on both flights identical, the great herringbone seats. Very comfy with lots of storage space. Service impeccable, food ex Brussels very average, slightly better ex Doha. Doha lounge massive, with good drinks, but average food. The place lacks soul. I had the chance to compare the B787 and A350 here, and the 350 wins with flying colors. Much quieter than the Boeing 787, the air is significantly less dry, the window shields more sophisticated, and even the toilet flush worked better. It feels more spacious and elegant than the 787.

Qatar Airways,3.0,L Trefler,8th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Paris to Goa via Doha on 2nd May. Departure/Arrival is from our local airport and food free baggage allowance. Poor service by crew on board and the meal service was below expectations, the portion size left me still hungry. I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past, but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This, in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays! The service takes a long time in coming and when it does, they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and don't come back to ask if you'd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay, the pastry, terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk, himself. The reason we have so far continued to fly with Qatar Airways is the convenience of flying direct to our end destination without necessitating an overnight hotel stay.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,CDG to GOI via DOH,2016-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,3.0,no

The food really isn't up to much but the comfort on a long flight makes it worth the upgrade cost. Both flights left on time and arrived early. Crew were attentive and professional.

Aeromexico,1.0,Mel Lavina,31st July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I travelled on July in Aeromexico from Mexico to Narita Tokyo - I had never had such a problems I found travelling in Aeromexico. For me it was the worst experience I had from an international airline. On July 4th from Tokyo to Mexico DF, the service was kind of self-service. I felt like the Aeromexico crew was acting as ""divas"" and we passengers, we were just the audience. They provided us some dinner then we had to wait almost one hour before the arrival to Tokyo to get another meal. Some people stand up to ask what happened with the meal, as almost all people were hungry. They said there was no problem, ""everything was under control"". Some snacks were provided at the back of the plane, however there was no information about this until you discovered them. On July 28th, the way back from Mexico to Tokyo was the longest flight in my life, as 2 or 3 hours after taking-off, they announced there was an electrical problem, not serious at all however we would need more fuel, so we were on the way to Guadalajara to refuel. This took two additional hours of a 12 hours flight! Also, the maintenance of one of the restroom was not good, as one of the toilet's lid couldn't stand on the tank, so for women we had to use it with the toilet lid standing on our back. I could not imagine how men did, to use this toilet. When I reported the problem to one person of the staff, the Aeromexico staff affirmed that restroom was working well, as she thought I was talking about a problem of flushing it. Then I showed her the toilet lid problem, she said: ""Oh, yeah"". Maybe for her it was not a problem! Additionally, one of the staff spilled some coke almost on me, the internal communication between staff on the plane, I heard one treating each other as ""cabron"", which shows again the non-professional staff working in Aeromexico. When they knew I could understand Spanish, they decided to move somewhere else to talk, and instead of being attentive to their passengers, they keep chitchatting during the flight. Aeromexico staff have no notion of in-flight service and service is at not all on the standards of a Skyteam airline.

Onboard, the aircraft interior looked worn, the air was stale and sticky. The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep.

We flew Qantas up to HK and had a 6 hour wait in HK. The first 3 hours of the flight is an eating delight. There were 2 fully decked out chefs on-board in Business class. The food presentation was just amazing. The food itself was very tasty and it just keep coming. Nothing was too much trouble. The table layout was like dining in a top restaurant and it even had an electronic candle that flickered. Breakfast was an equally excellent experience of service and taste. The seats are very roomy and quite comfortable for that long 11 hour flight and go fully flat. Ok the not so good. And it their lounge in HK. Its not their own lounge and its a shared arrangement. Its very down market and not very well appointed. To have a shower you had to book in and the next available time was 11.45pm 20 min after my flight was to leave.

Emirates,2.0,L Reece,15th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU$ 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed ( did my way into Europe on a wheelchair) and although feeling much better, I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully, as every time i filled everything and clicked â€œupgradeâ€ a message came out that â€œthe system was downâ€! (Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue ) Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes! I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down (so it was not my fault) they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same! On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email (asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane! While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us$ 864) I am so angry and disappointed but, if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money. In fact those seats have remained empty and Emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years.

Brisbane lounge although new is humble re reading material and food. Auckland is much better, Wellington domestic the best of the lot. We missed our domestic connection in AKL due to long queues in the airport, this was handled well by the airline.

Alitalia,1.0,T Chanikan,25th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Geneva to Catania via Geneva and I was unable to check-in online. The airline counter at Geneva was only able to check me in until Rome and informed me that I will have to check-in for Catania at Rome. I expressed my anxiousness as to whether the transit desk at Rome will be able to check me in time before the gate closes, to which the person at the counter informed me that I needn't go to the transit desk but go directly to the gate and ask for the boarding pass. At Rome, i ran to the gate, only to be hand waved into going to the transit desk. There was a long queue of passengers ahead of me, and just one person manning the transit desk. After an hour of waiting, with just 10 minutes for the gate to close i was handed a boarding pass that said I was on standby and was asked to join another queue that simply said 'standby list'. With two minutes left to the gate closing, another kind employee of alitalia informed me that I will have to go back to the transit desk and informed me without any explanations that I will not be able to travel on that flight. After standing in a queue for the third time the transit desk guy informed me that there's nothing he could do and asked me to go to the Alitalia counter at arrivals saying they would provide me accommodations and an alternative flight. After standing in that queue for a further 45mins, I was told that I will have to go to the Alitalia counter at departures since apparently this counter could do nothing to help me (why inform me to go there in the first place?). At the queue at the departures counter, after a final wait of a bit more than an hour, I was handed my accommodation voucher and 'dinner' voucher at 1am the next day. Awesome. I arrived at Rome at 8:30pm and had spent 4h30mins standing in lines to nowhere and running between counters, with not so much of an apology. Your plans don't matter. It doesn't matter if you are tired and starving. You are simply one amongst the 100 others that missed Alitalia's flights, because they can't be bothered to have more than one person at any given counter.

One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful.

Air Canada,7.0,Nahanni McKay,7th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We took Air Canada from Calgary to Vancouver during a huge snow storm. We were delayed on the tarmac for five hours for only a one hour flight. The captain said we only had twenty minutes left about six times. We eventually learn our flight was cancelled and head back to the gate. Only to learn that our flight was in fact not cancelled and we had to wait to get the plane de-iced again. We live in Canada so this is expected to have a major snow storm. The people on the plane were tired, cranky and we were all hungry. We were also not offered free food or drinks during our delay. Which by the 4th hour we all really just wanted a beer. But Air Canada gave the flight a e-coupon to everyone that went through that experience which really made an impression that Air Canada cares about their customers and their status.

United Airlines,1.0,Constance Marshall,10th September 2014,After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it. Airline food has never been great but it's reached a new low. United should be ashamed of their service. We won't fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Aeromexico,7.0,JosÃ© Maldonado,12th November 2015,"Durango to Monterrey via Mexico City. Nice flight, the only thing that I saw Is when I called to the call center requesting an upgrade 48 hours before the flight (supposedly in a platinum level you can call even 72 hours before the fight in order to request the upgrade) they told me that they had not available spaces for free upgrades. So I could pay for it or I had to wait to be in the flight date at the airline desk in order to ask for it. When I did it, the person at the desk (Durango airport) told me that she had not available seats so anyway I requested her to put me in the waiting list. I was the 3rd passenger that arrived at the airport for that flight (Durango has a small airport and the second passenger is my friend and he didn't requested an upgrade) - she answered yes no problem I will remember you because I will be at the gate collecting the boarding passes. At the boarding time I could see that the lady called anther person that arrived later than me (about three or four persons) and she gave them upgrades - I don't know why she didn't gave it to me even if I arrived before than them. I think you should allow to get an upgrade to any platinum level that calls 72 hours to get an upgrade because we are into the period of time requested by Aeromexico, obviously if there are free seats.

United Airlines,1.0,Suzan Parks,27th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Cozumel to Oklahoma City via Houston. This airline is horrible. The measly amount I spend on travel isnâ€™t a drop in the bucket to these people and it shows! They know that people have to fly and we donâ€™t have all that many options and they take advantage of that. We were trying to get home to OKC from Cozumel and on our way to the airport from our resort I receive a text that our flight was delayed one hour..ok, no big deal. Get to the airport and I proceed to get three more texts just adding more and more delay time. We end up sitting in the tiny Cozumel airport for 5 hours. Finally get on the plane and the flight attendant is condescending and rude. I asked for headphones and she said â€œno..Iâ€™ve already been up and down this aisle asking 3 timesâ€. Thatâ€™s untrue, she asked 1 time and I said no because I didnâ€™t realize Iâ€™d be able to watch the movie, I thought I would have to pay extra to watch. When I realized I was going to be able to watch, thatâ€™s when I asked for headphones. I did it politely and still she spoke to me as though I was a child. We get to Houston and the plane stopped, people thought we were at the gate and proceeded to stand (many people were desperately trying to catch connection..us included), come to find out we were not actually at gate (there wasnâ€™t one available because we were so late) flight attendant comes on speaker and begins to berate those standing up. I get it, itâ€™s a safety issue but a courteous please sit back down, weâ€™re not at a gate would have sufficed. Again, she was condescending, spoke to all of us as if we were idiots. So we ended up sitting on the runway for 20-30 minutes or so and we did indeed miss our connecting flight. We went to customer service (we had already asked to be put on standby for the last flight of the night for OKC) just to be told the later flight was overbooked and we had a slim chance of getting on..my husband had looked on the app and it showed they had three open seats. Told by customer service something along the lines of â€œthose are seats blocked off by travel agents for potential customersâ€? And to make matters worse, that all flights were full until 9:30 pm the next night! Putting us in Houston for over 24 hours. So apparently customers who have already paid arenâ€™t as important and customers who might possibly book in the future? Makes no sense! I tried to tell them we needed to get home as we have jobs and kids and I was completely out of blood pressure medication. At that point I just wanted to rent a car and drive the 8 hours home. Asked about reimbursement for having to rent a car, it was a no-go. So we crossed our fingers and went to wait and see if we got on on standby (oh I failed to mention, this flight was delayed as well). We got the last two standby seats thank god, however the plane was very old, very uncomfortable and something kept banging under my feet. Needless to say Iâ€™m glad it was just an hour home. Iâ€™ve never been so glad to have my feet on the ground. I will be using another airline from now on and will suggest all my friends and family do the same. I understand sometimes delays are inevitable (this wasnâ€™t weather related, we were never told what was going on) but the lack of customer service after the fact and the rudeness of the flight attendants is enough to turn me completely off of United.",,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Cozumel to Oklahoma City via Houston,March 2019,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world).

Cabin crew always showed up with a smile, and one can clearly saw that they were trying to provide upscale service. The big letdown was the food. I had better meals in economy with other carriers, and that was the first time I left my meal mostly untouched. Dessert was, however, pretty good, so that became my dinner. I had the exact same experience on my return flight from Buenos Aires, so this seemed consistent. What puzzled me was how AA let this minor thing ruined all other improvements they made.

Emirates,4.0,J Dickinson,10th May 2014,London Gatwick - Dubai EK016 1/5/2014. Dubai - Kuala Lumpur EK346 2/5/2014. I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,no

I have witnessed how they make their customers disassemble electronic-quipped bags in front of the boarding door, or made me stuff a cumbersome item into my backpack (to try make me pay for it) when later I was told itâ€™s perfectly fine for it to be in my travel bag.

Then we spent about an hour on the ground before departing for Salt Lake City. Inflight food ordering system showed limited availability of snacks and no special cocktails. I have not flown Virgin America for years so not sure how long ago they discontinued that gimmick. Cabin crew seemed on edge. Flight landed at Salt Lake City, refueled, waited, then departed for SFO and arrived more than 2 hours late - at 12:30 am. Cabin crew distributed what was left of beverages on second leg of flight.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,Shubham Bakshi,12th September 2018,"Not Verified | Delta has to be the most inefficient and useless flight in hurricane situation. I was flying from Boston to Greensboro, NC for a job interview on Friday when the hurricane is supposed to hit the region. My employer canceled the interview, but since they did not cancel the flight, I was told that this is voluntary change that I am making. Additionally, I had to fly before September 20th, since the ""bulletin"" board mentioned that is the law. 2 flaws in these statements: A bulletin board cannot determine that my flight needs to be on a certain date because that is when my employer wants to interview. I would love to fly before September 20th, but I cannot do that- that is impossible from my employer's perspective. When it is supposed to rain 20 inches and since you have not canceled the flight, does not mean that flight will not fly. Just because you dont cancel the flight does not mean that the hazard of the hurricane goes away. Extremely rude customer representatives who would argue with me about my own thought process, would not let me finish the sentence and would keep on going on and on about this supposed bulletin board that is their law.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Surinder Aassi,26th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Amritsar to Dubai via Doha. Flight from Amritsar to Doha on A321 which was well maintained and legroom was good. The boarding started an hour earlier but not done zone wise and took almost 30 minutes to board the plane. No greetings from crew when boarded. The A321 is full and it would be better, if they deploy a bigger aircraft. The flight attendants were just doing their job and not smiling. Refreshing towel pack handed out and menus were given. Drinks served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served out of Amritsar was not up to 5 star mark and very average dinner. Veg Biryani with one small teaspoon of lentils and tasted bland. Desert of Mango Kheer tasted better. The main course is small. No tea or coffee served after the meal and you have to ask for this. Inflight entertainment was good. But the touch screen option takes longer time to do the action assigned. The good thing about this flight is that it departed 10 minutes before time and reached 20 minutes ahead of its scheduled arrival time. On reaching Doha, bussed to the arrival hall which is just 5 minutes ride. As there is no other flight arrival quickly pass through security for transits and then straight to departure hall. Flight to Dubai on A321 was comfortable. Flight attendants were smiling, attentive and doing their job with passion.

Efficient boarding. Second United Airlines service of the day to IAH, so the flight was quite empty (ended up with all three seats in the middle section to myself). The 787 was still very new and presented a very clean and airy cabin, helped by the larger than normal windows and lack of passengers. Comfortable seat with an excellent headrest which folds to support your head, and stays in place. Extremely quiet in terms of cabin noise (engines). Food service was reasonable and wine and beer served for free (premium drinks charged US$7.99 to US$8.99). WiFi worked very well for the entire duration of the flight (US$20 for the duration). Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight. Houston - Sao Paulo: 100% full flight (the norm for Brazil - USA flights). Long delay at the gate with no explanation. Leather type seats which I am not a fan of as they seem to cause you to slip down when sleeping. Headrest folds but does not stay in place. 767 very noisy (probably more because of the fact that I just got off a 787). But a clean cabin and good service. Again a reasonable main meal, good service and flight attendants constantly passing through the cabin with water. Let down by breakfast, only a little sandwich (not great at 0900h after 10 hour in the air). Very good inflight entertainment on both flight with good video monitors and a good selection of movies and TV shows (with a great option of being able to watch the shows on your tablet).

I have flown for work for the past 10 years on different airlines including United and this has been the worst experience.

Initially I was questioned about the size of my carry-on which I travel with all the time. She right away said to check it and I tried to put it in the size checker and I explained that I had placed my laptop in the outside pocket which is why it looks â€œthickerâ€ so let me just put it inside the bag and itâ€™ll be fine and she just said â€œif you check it you canâ€™t check the laptopâ€ and I replied â€œno, the point is Iâ€™m not checking it bc it fitsâ€ and she said â€œitâ€™s doesnt fit so check it - I made an announcement earlier so you should knowâ€. Firstly, the bag fit, and so she just walked away without saying anything and then secondly since when is it ok to â€œscoldâ€ me like I â€œshould knowâ€? Really? Then I cut my finger on the size checker and I asked a flight attendant for a bandaid and she said she canâ€™t get one. I said Iâ€™m bleeding.

WIFI is almost impossible to use at Moscow, so without communications she was very upset to have missed her flight. The staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful telling her it was her fault that she missed the connection, however with hundreds of other people all missing connecting flights it would appear not. She had to queue for another hour just to talk to customer service. With no other options, we had to book her another ticket at considerable expense and then told that her return flight was invalid, due to her missing the connecting flight. So yet another expense booking her flight home. One of the busiest times of the year, you can imagine how much money we have spent on these flights.

Emirates,2.0,Myriam Acevedo,11th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the planeâ€™s door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room. Delta, United or American Airlines would have offered the same experience, so what makes Emirates the best economy airline in the world? This was scheduled to be a 14 + hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dubai, canâ€™t Emirates use the most comfortable, newest aircrafts for these long-haul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights? Emirates certainly does not think so. Employeeâ€™s presentation, another let down, no gorgeous counter or on-board flight attendants which left a lot to be desired, not all smiles here, far from the gorgeous look I was expecting. Cabin service was a let down as well, for a 14-hour flight, I would have expected more than just dinner (when dinner was served, I had the Szechuan chicken, it was tasteless). Breakfast, a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14-hour flight, we had to get up and ask for water several times. Overall my first experience flying with Emirates was nothing as expected, it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. I will say that Emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy, unfortunately, it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly Delta or American internationally, again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Kim Linson,1st August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | My flight was supposed to be such a short trip, that is why I chose to fly instead of drive from Seattle to Spokane. Both flights were majorly delayed on my trip and it defeated the purpose of flying. In addition to that, it seemed very prominent with the crew that this is a regular thing. When I go onto the plane, the overhead bins barely fit my carry on purse. I had to fly with my carry on underneath my feet. With all the delay and keeping us at the airport so long, you think they would at least hand out pretzels or water. Nope. Terrible schedule and service. I will never be flying Delta again. Should have flown Alaska. They had a Spokane to Seattle flight scheduled for later than mine - that arrived in Seatac before my Delta flight did.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Spokane,July 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

I decided to give it another try from Kona to Los Angeles and was really hoping for a good experience. It wasn't horrible but well below the standards of even Delta or Hawaiian.The aircraft is ancient and the only entertainment available is if you know in advance to download the United app. There is no advance notice of this, there is no WiFi at Kona airport anyway. If you haven't done this there is nothing. Unbelievably no one told the crew boarding had commenced and I walked into a dark cabin to find flight attendants sleeping in row 2. Embarrassing for all. Once they woke up the senior staff was actually fine with the minimum they are given to offer. Food was ok although oddly dessert consisted of a single piece of chocolate offered on the tray next to some crackers. No bread or salad was offered. This for a 5 hour flight in first class us a bit bizarre.

I then called American and got them to put me on the original flight that was delayed and move my connecting flights. My plan was to just sleep in Chicago and fly from Chicago to London and London to Nice the following day. After taking the original delayed flight I got a hotel in Chicago for 200$ because the flight out the next day was not until 5:05pm. 5 hour delay on the flight from Chicago to London - over 2 hours were on-board sitting at the gate. I missed the connection from London to Nice and they put me on another flight which was also delayed 1 hour. I finally arrived in Nice over 24 hours later than the ticket I purchased.

The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie! I also fly often to Toronto in planes with 2-5-2 configuration and that is more comfortable sadly the FAs and the good are still rubbish.

Onboard the service was pretty good with decent food especially since the flights were relatively short. Business class with the A320 is your luck of the draw, on one of the 3 flights in this aircraft type business class was simply an economy seat with the middle seat left empty as is the case with European airlines. This is unfair to passengers who are paying a lot of money only to end up in an economy seat, on the A330 it is a completely different experience with a massive seat, tons of privacy and space an altogether different experience.

Emirates,3.0,Thomas Pittschieler,10th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I was flying Emirates from Muscat to New York via Dubai, with a friend who has an Arabic last name. During boarding we were called aside at the boarding counter as his name had to undergo an additional security clearance. We were the first ones to commence the boarding procedure, but after 2 hours of waiting they still had not resolved the issue. They told us the visa was OK, and that it was some kind of issue in the Emirates systems. We were not told exactly what the issue was, all we could see was that the boarding desk in Dubai was arguing with the Emirates office in JFK for the boarding release. The debate affected three travelling parties. Despite the flight already being 45 minutes delayed the JFK office refused to support the Dubai ground staff in clearing the passengers, but instead opted to open a roughly half-hour general debate with the Dubai desk on how to use the system and on the trainings they needed. This debate was held on loud-speaker. Long story, short: In the end I was told to board the plane alone or lose my flight while my friend was offloaded to take a following flight. (Curiously enough 5 minutes after Emirates closed the flight my friend was cleared, but by then it was too late to get aboard). I ended up waiting for him half a day at JFK. I found the whole incident to be quite unprofessional, and I believe the airline ground staff (especially in JFK) should collaborate more in the interest of the customer rather than power playing games with each other. This is the third incident I had with Emirates (I was once told to choose another carrier if I didnâ€™t like flying with Emirates after they kept delaying my flights for 2 working days).",,Business,Economy Class,MCT to JFK via DXB,April 2016,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no

Emirates,1.0,Dan Ross,24th September 2014,EK432 Dubai to Brisbane via Singapore (Continuation after EK2 - see separate post). Economy B777-300ER. Disembarking from EK2 all transfer pax clear a security check before entering the terminal eliminating the need for it at the gate. Clear signage to the next gate. Not impressed with T3B terminal. Boarding was just turn up and go. No order. Once onboard the difference between the A380 and B777 is quiet marked. Seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. I had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by I was bumped. The person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. It was most uncomfortable not helped by the AV units under the seat taking up space. The food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. A roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. No sausage bacon or baked beans. The last dinner I had was a bit bland a beef casserole. Would have benefited from a wine reduction. The AV on this craft was the old ICE. Far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. Very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. We had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in India. We were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 BNE time. At no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in BNE. I had to spend my time in Singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. Very poor form.

For the positive side, the airplane staff was very good, The Frankfurt air port transfer process for a person requiring wheelchair is bad, when we were coming back from Bangalore to SJC on 24th Sept 2018 we almost missed the flight at the Frankfurt due to mismanagement of the wheel chair group. Too many hands were involved in transfer and the ball got dropped. We needed to take things on our end and walk with great difficulty.

Qatar Airways,10.0,S Collins,8th January 2016,"Manchester to Perth return via Doha, and we were very impressed with all aspects of our travel experience with Qatar Airways. All our flights (4 in all) were well organised and on time. The planes were clean and looked new. Cabin crew were very efficient and helpful. Food was very good for 'plane food' and in economy class. Leg room was very acceptable especially as my husband is over 6 feet tall. Entertainment offered was the same on all 4 flights, but was varied and there was plenty to choose from. The airport at Doha was beautiful and its' structure was much admired by my consultant structural engineer husband. On the return flight we had an 8 hour layover at Doha so decided to book the Airport Hotel for 5-8 hour slot. A little pricey but well worth having a rest and a swim for nearly an hour in a stunning pool on the 4th floor overlooking the concourse. I think the staff were somewhat surprised to find a middle aged couple so keen on a swim so early in the morning!

However, minimal efforts were provided to comfort the passengers. Cots and blankets were piled in one area, first come first serve. No compensation was provided (i.e. food vouchers, coupons for future flights, water). No one offered to dim the lights. No efforts were made to silence or turn off the televisions. I asked one of the attendants for something as little as ear foam plugs but none were provided. On top of all of that, there was a fire alarm test of the building that lasted approximately 20 minutes at 4am. Attendants refused to provide the customer's baggage to leave the airport to seek lodging elsewhere and/or procure other transportation to their destination. Customer satisfaction reached a new level of low. Flight attendants all departed from the airport after cots and blankets were distributed. It seemed like the attendants said, ""It's not my problem anymore"". It is understandable that decisions were made from the bosses in the top, however it is the attendant's responsibility to try to provide maximum comfort to the passengers whenever possible.

The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

After arriving at San Diego International Airport at 430am for my 7am departure our flight was delayed over and hour. This delay was not due to weather. We landed at JFK Airport and we waited well over a half hour to even get off to a gate to de-board. This caused me to miss my layover to Syracuse, NY. Although Delta did pay for the next flight out to Syracuse, NY via Delta airlines, this turned into a 4 hour layover. Now that we are finally ready to depart from JFK and finally on my way home after an exhausting day of unexpected travel, we are again delayed not due to weather but waiting an another plan to land so other customers can make this connecting flight. We were supposed to depart at 856 and it's been 40 minutes.

The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. The food is similar to others in the same category. You can even order cocktails on long haul flights and they even serve with a smile. My personal opinion is that elder stewardesses or stewards can give better service than younger ones.

American Airlines,1.0,A McCormick,18th August 2014,"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,Andrew Gibson,19th January 2015,MAN to EWR RT BusinessFirst. I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,D Stewart,26th August 2014,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no
Emirates,9.0,Matthew Hunter,21st January 2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front.

On the negative side, I would expect in the future to have in flight entertainment such as a personal TV screen and Wifi connectivity. Aegean Airlines during the summer connects a lot of international passengers to the Greek Islands and I think from next summer they should consider doing it.

Emirates,1.0,J van der See,14th October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn't bother waiting in the queue as they weren't giving out hotel or meal vouchers. I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates. On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now ""considered the matter closed"", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you're looking to fly Emirates - beware! They may show you great service (which is a bit hit and miss anyway), but when things go wrong, they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to BNE via DXB,August 2016,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,10.0,James Tinning,12th September 2013,Perth WA to London LHR on 8 August. I have never felt so well looked after onboard any airline. Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE. Again wonderful entertainment. The food was wonderful at all parts of the journey and various meals are provided with generous portions. The cabin crew were so professional and smart very friendly.

American Airlines,1.0,S Gil,13th October 2015,"Booked two flights online to Chicago at $300 more per ticket than several other airlines because we had a gift certificate we wanted to use. While trying to select our seats, the only seats showing available cost an extra $58 per seat. I called AA and the 'customer service' representative informed me that she could make the seat selection for me, but that would cost an extra $25 per seat. I explained that I was requesting assistance because their website wasn't allowing me to make my selection. She said the only way she could help me without an extra charge was to transfer me to their technical assistance department and, if that person there could not help me, he/she could transfer me back to 'customer service' and authorize a waiver. Then, they could make my seat selection without charging me extra. The person at the technical assistance desk informed me that there were seats available at the quoted price, but that I had to complete my purchase, and select my seats 30 minutes afterward. It actually took eight hours to receive a confirmation, and I still could not make a seat selection. Once again I called 'customer service' and the rep informed me that the only way I could select my seats was to pay an additional $25 dollars per reservation. Otherwise, I needed to wait until the day of departure in order to be assigned seats at the gate. They could not even guarantee that we would be seated together. In light of the ridiculous two-day process of trying to get assigned seating, I asked to speak to a supervisor but was refused any assistance, refused to give me her employee ID (finally gave in after five or six requests), and refused to put me in contact with her supervisor. This is the first and last time I will fly American Airlines. Their flights are over priced and, based on their pathetic lack of any regard for the customer, their staff is over paid. After seeing the other reviews, I have no idea how they are still in business. Apparently, one-star ratings are commonplace for this travesty of an airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,California to Chicago,October 2015,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no
Air Canada,2.0,T Reynolds,21st July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I recently flew Air Canada business class from NYC LGA to Toronto YYZ. Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a ""snack"" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in ""so quickly"" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would ""catch up"" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared. If she hadn't walked into that room, I would've sat there waiting for my name to pop up on some screen and wasted more time! I was considering Air Canada for future Asian and / or European trips but after experiencing this, I am not flying them ever again.

Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai.

United Airlines,1.0,Deborah Scott,26th July 2015,"As a child our family always flew United. However, it has gotten progressively worse through the years to the point that I would rather pay a more for a ticket than fly United ever again. Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo, the check in machine didn't work right. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but said she could not help us with gate-to-gate connection (e.g. passenger carts) as that was something ""you didn't do"" and simply didn't seem to care that we had a need. In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off, causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter, saw our plane sitting at the gate, but weren't allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us, ""Oh, we knew you were coming. We just couldn't wait for you."" To make matters worse United booked us on a flight to Anchorage for the next night. In the end we got flights on Alaska Airlines and got into Anchorage about 2:30am which allowed us time to sleep in our booked hotel room before making the trip to Seward by bus, getting us there in plenty of time to board our ship. Alaska Airlines personnel were superb in demeanor, helpfulness, and care, something that United personnel were seriously lacking. Our return trip from Vancouver, BC to Buffalo started out much differently than when we went. The staff in Vancouver were helpful and courteous. But once we got to Chicago, they were anything but! I think the personnel of United Airlines in the US could take a few lessons from those from our Vancouver neighbors. We have had other unacceptable experiences in the past with United Airlines but this one takes the cake and is really the one that put us over the edge.

United Airlines,3.0,M Tonelli,31st July 2015,"My experience took a full 2 days when it should have taken only 15 hours. My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals.

United Airlines,1.0,S Wahl,10th June 2014,The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft.

Food by Turkish Do&Co was as always delicious. Price paid was super. I do look forward to my next TK flight which will be in six days.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Rossini Maitre,13th April 2014,I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed. They had no consideration for people's choice or diet preferences. You may get lucky but you may also dearly regret flying with them.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Brian Fox,22nd July 2015,"On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home. I will never fly United again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dublin via Toronto,June 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Y Johnson,16th August 2018,"Not Verified | My recent flight from JFK New York to Sacramento via Atlanta was 24 hours from hell. Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it.

The return from KIX to AMS was good with a fast check in and efficient pass through customs (although no fast track was offered). The lounge is small but very comfortable with some odd seats looking out over the runway. Flight home was on a 777-300 which had better seating than on flight out. Again the staff were excellent funny and friendly. Could not ask for more. The food was well prepared tasty and very hot. The cabin was almost empty which meant could spread out. Got at least 6 hours of perfect sleep. The flight home from AMS to LHR was on KLM city hopper. Very small plane and it was packed.

They were not accepting a second bag even if you wanted to pay. I asked them what I could do and they said I could board the flight but only if I left one bag behind. Forcing passengers with more than one luggage to give up their seats on an overbooked flight so they could solve their over booked flight without any compensation. If you ever take Aeromexico don't assume you can just pay for an extra bag. You can take 2 bags but you may have to either leave one behind or get moved to another flight.

Emirates,5.0,H Calavo,23rd April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in DÃ¼sseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.",A380 / Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Dusseldorf to Shanghai via Dubai,April 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes

American Airlines,8.0,D Graubard,10th May 2015,AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions.

When asking for a drink before the food service they said only after food service - still 45 minutes away. In the mean time at least 20 times they walked passed my seat. The main issue we faced was with our baggage. In New York at check- in one bag was 24.5kg and the other was 18kg. They still forced me to unpack the lighter bag and move 1.5kg to the other bag. I found this utterly irritating especially since the tickets where bought together and our combined allowance was higher. The only answer I got was that its the policy. We took a few days break in Schiphol. There we had an even worse baggage experience at the check in. We used one of those self baggage check in machines because the normal desk had a huge queue. We checked our first bag without a problem but the 2nd bag was 24.2kg. The machine refused to accept the overweight bag and pointed us to KLM staff. Looking at the queue we removed 1kg of clothes and put it in our hand baggage. But what a hassle and that despite that we were far below our total baggage quota for 2 persons.

I purchase First Class tickets, typically in the region of $5-6000 USD for a return trip. I have to say that AA First Class is not a patch on other international carriers. My most recent trip, the hard product was okay, the seat was comfortable and that was about it. The AVOD system is old, slow, low resolution with a tiny screen. The choice of movies is very limited. Even bearing that in mind, this can be made up for in service. I found the flight crew to be indifferent, the service below average and the attitude seemed to be we were a constant inconvenience preventing them from being able to get back to the socializing at the front of the cabin. I am a very, very low maintenance flyer, but I found even the basics were missed. On the outbound leg, I wasn't even offered a drink at boarding! This is in International First Class. Food choices weren't available from the menu (I was in 2J) and I get the distinct impression that most people on the flight were on FF upgrades as opposed to paying pax. On the return flight, an AA employee (non flight crew) was sitting across from me - he was attentively taken care of, chatted to, given menus/drinks/turn down etc. The Airline is in trouble when it takes care of employees over premium passengers paying thousands of dollars for a seat. Aircraft is getting really old, this was a B777-200, and the interior was probably late 90's or early 2000's. Other than the large seats, everything was to a lower fit, finish and equipment level than an Alaska B737 in economy! There is not excuse for this, in fact, the AA A320 on the connecting flight to Seattle was way better with USB ports, power and a really nice big hi res AVOD system. Delta flies old airplanes too, but their interiors are bang up to date. There was not even a standard 110V power outlet - in First Class! It's hard to be a repeat customer, AA has been good in the past, but they are now firmly in the United Airlines category for me, they don't seem to be too bothered about earning my dollars.

Our choice was to fly with a free bag each and we were initially given the very worst seats on the aircraft the two right at the back by the toilets.

I was offered the choice of two other meals but did not want either of them and settled for another starter. Flying this airline is not what it was it used to be a great experience now the on board staff don't really care what happens.

Going in December the London to Istanbul leg was on par with the business class for other carriers I had flown with both in terms of the seats and the service.

The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration.

The staff took care of her luggage, took the bags at the gates and put them in the overhead bins near her seat. When my wife needed some toys for my daughter, they took the bag out and helped her take out what she needed and put the bags back. Because of the support from staff the journey was very comfortable and enjoyable.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to ATL,2016-05-01 00:00:00,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,yes

Air New Zealand,5.0,Anders Pedersen,16th January 2014,SYD-AKL-NAD-AKL in Jan 2014. All flights on 777-300 with herring pattern arranged â€œspace-seatsâ€ in business (and eco+?). All flights on time. Aircraft clean staff neat and all flights on time. Food good. Lounges very good in all three airports visited. Only the lounge staff could improve. On board the planes a similar attitude: FAs appear to be very local somehow managing to disrespect passengers by being by far too familiar and too self- confident doing too much talking for nothing and on the verge of being intrusive. All FAs (except a single one) were clearly ageing over the hill and that shows. Order details were forgotten during the lengthy chat sessions which at times were embarrassing or painful. On the outbound I had 13 hours transit in AKL and no hotel was provided as this was a regular schedule time gap! They also managed not to reload my bag to NAD and it remained in AKL. Arrived 28 hours later to Suva upon filling forms and lots of confusion and phone calls.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,2.0,no

Emirates,2.0,A Vitolins,4th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Sydney to Copenhagen via Dubai. Have been flying with Emirates before and overall experience is ok. On a last return trip flights itself were faultless - well almost - my original seat was slightly out of the shape and I had to change seats once. However my complementary Dubai Connect overnight stay was a mess - after landing in Dubai a little over 1pm I finally got into hotel room just before 6pm. I spent all time waiting in queues. Also nobody at hotel knew how and what time I'm going to be picked up in the next morning. Next morning the Hotel staff advised me to take a taxi to the airport and that the bill will be refunded by Emirates. They were wrong - Emirates customer service basically accused me of being cheat after I requested refund for the taxi. I took a taxi but apparently I had to wait for some mysterious bus Hotel staff didn't know about - I would never request the refund in the first place if I new it will turn out this way.

Air Canada,5.0,J De Boer,5th May 2014,Flew SYD-YVR business class on 777-200. The seat configuration is not great for couples my husband and I sat in the middle two seats and were divided by a partition and the angle of the seats meant that to speak to each other we both had to turn sideways and backwards. I could eyeball the person across the aisle more easily but the distance was such you couldn't have a quiet conversation thus still not satisfactory when traveling with someone. Not a lot of room to place personal items in easy reach during the flight. Service was excellent there was plenty of courteous and helpful staff. Food was nice 4 choices of main course I enjoyed my fish also the entree prawn salad. I have to agree with previous reviewer the head phones disposable foam ear pieces were very tricky to stretch over the phones easily torn and easily lost when taking the head phones off. Flat bed was good but I didn't sleep well sinuses didn't cope well with the aircon. Would use Air Canada again.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Qatar A380 business has to be my favorite aircraft, so quiet and comfortable. Boeing 787 to Copenhagen was full, I donâ€™t like this cabin compared to that of both the 380 and 350 - I feel you are more â€˜exposedâ€™ even though itâ€™s the same seat and the 787 is by far a noisier aircraft. One area where Qatar needs to improve is the food, it was abysmal on both sectors, the offering from Doha was disgusting.

American Airlines,1.0,M Andrews,25th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I can see by the reviews here that American Airlines could not care less about bad reviews. I wouldnâ€™t even give them one star if I had a choice. For an international flight, we purchased additional miles for $1300 so that we would have enough miles to fly â€œmain cabin extraâ€. (This is an extra cost over regular coach because you get extra leg room and other benefits). Being claustrophobic, I needed the seats that we originally chose. AA changed the plane that they were going to fly to Australia (a 15.5 hour flight from LA) and took it upon themselves to move us to much worse seats in the regular coach section. My husband is a Platinum flier for life with 3 million miles flown on AA. After speaking to several supervisors at the platinum desk and writing to customer service, AA refused to do anything about it. At the very least, they should have refunded the $1300 that we had to pay to purchase extra miles in order to get the upgraded section! Shame on you American Airlines. Itâ€™s no wonder that you no longer carry an elite status in the airline industry if this is how you treat your customers who have been loyal to you for many years!

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Richard Kranzel,13th February 2016,Arrived at Mcaron airport on day of flight. Flight was boarded then cancelled. Was put on next available flight which also was cancelled. Ended up being routed to Sacramento. Then it cost me more money to get from Sacramento to reno than the original ticket cost. Cost me $40.00 roundtrip just to pick up my bag at Reno airport. Total cost between airport food gas mileage etc around $380.00 Original ticket $222.98 . I'm a disabled veteran on a fixed income. I asked for a refund of the original ticket cost. Southwest took five business days to approve the refund no thanks to there customer service center. After five days I had to call the corporate office in Dallas and was lucky enough to get someone on the phone who could at the least push my claim through to approval status. I got every every excuse imaginable from there customer service reps but the one constant was that this was there policy on refunds and I would just have to wait. They took my money immediately out of my account when I bought the ticket so why is so hard for them to put it back. Seriously the IRS processes tax returns faster than Southwest will process a customer refund. As of this posting I still have not received my refund and with a holiday weekend here I guess I'll be lucky to see it by next week. Shame on you Southwest airlines.

I told her that was unacceptable and I was mad, at that point she hung up on me. I called back, was hung up on again! I called back extremely upset by this point and got a gentlemen who told the same thing the first lady told me and that the only way the airline would consider giving me a refund was to file a claim with the airline.

Boarding was prompt but could have stayed in the lounge as it had an excellent breakfast menu and great seating. On board was offered a glass of French which at 4.30 am is the only way to start the day. Seat was more than comfortable and the staff were first rate. Breakfast offering after take-off included a healthy option or the more traditional fare of bacon and eggs etc. The crew now use an electronic form on smart devices to take your order. Lunch was served 2 hours from landing and again an excellent choice. Landed on time and after 90 minutes it was off to London on EK 003. Again the crew were welcoming and drinks offered before take off and orders promptly taken when airborne. More food served before landing at London Heathrow and landing was right on time. On each flight passengers are offered a mattress to put on the seat and in some cases an extra pillow.

When going back home to Ft. Laud the ticket counter girl in LA was rude didn't tell us what gate to go to then the flight attendants were very rude - again as if they were annoyed to be there and the remote controls and TV screens were sticky and filthy.

Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that ""sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point"". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,R Dee,31st October 2014,I had a short 2-hr flight from Naples to Istanbul before transferring to JFK-NY. It was a full flight and they were far over their overhead storage capacity by about 8 carry-on suitcases. Often you'll be a few spaces short but I've seldom seen that many. I imagine the problem was caused because the airline check-in agent was not enforcing the 1 carry-on 1 personal item (which is to be pushed under seat or held on your lap) policy. This is negligence on the airlines part. However the flight attendants did the right thing by keeping on the carry-on luggage onboard and not putting it beneath the plane therefore allowing us to be on our way quickly. They offered excellent service with full meal alcoholic beverages and newspapers offered free on a 2-hr flight. The service on the flight from Istanbul to JFK was also quite good. However for whatever reason they did not allow you to pick your seat when you book (at least the system didn't when I tried) so as I result I got stuck in a middle seat which I always try to avoid.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

The real surprise was the 319 which has ""proper"" business class seats even on this short three-hour flight (i.e. four seats in a row rather than the usual six seats with the middle seat kept free). Good selection of food and drinks. Plenty of IFE (about 50 movies to choose from and on-demand even on the short-haul sector). Most staff didn't speak too much English but perfectly fine to get the job done. The only letdown was Moscow airport. Yes the terminal building has been refurbished to international standards but the many uniformed people barking at you in Russian and the organisational chaos are still a nuisance. No customer service culture there. I chose Aeroflot on price and got very good value for money.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,2.0,T Green,3rd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | My flight left Detroit late, but onboard we were told time may be made up in air. Several times I asked a staff member about making my connecting flight. I was told she would check. This didnâ€™t happen. When we landed I had 40 min before departure. I asked a staff member about which gate to go to. He told me I could check the screen. He also said if I ran (Iâ€™m 71) I could make it. He said the airport was easy to navigate. It was not. He said there were others going on that same flight and the Air France to Cape Town staff knew we were coming. He said theyâ€™d hold the flight, not to worry. After I deplaned I couldnâ€™t find the screen so I ran, through security, through shops, onto a tram, asking at other gates where my gate was and was told by 1 person they were too busy. I got someone to tell me the gate number and after running as fast as I could I got to the gate, the plane was there but I was told boarding was closed. 14 hours later I was on my way to Johannesburg, not Cape Town.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,A Bastien,4th May 2014,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international.

Hence instead of going through a dedicated security line for passengers connecting to domestic flights I found myself in the main airport arrivals area bringing all my checked baggage with me even though it was tagged to Victoria my final destination. I asked an AC staff member driving an electric cart whether there was somewhere to drop my checked baggage or whether I should head for the domestic check-in queues.

Meal service was done business class style - the entree and dessert are served on a tray and the main course followed. The seat was upholstered with leather and had a very good recline and pitch. I was very impressed by the cheerfulness and enthusiasm of the flight attendants on board. Despite the AKL-PPT-AKL turnaround route being a tiring long red-eye flight, they remained at their very best throughout the 5-hour flight attending to and anticipating passengersâ€™ needs. At Auckland Airport, Premium Economy passengers had a dedicated check-in lounge shared with business class.

Air New Zealand,7.0,Chris Fox,18th November 2013,Travelled PER-AKL on Air NZ aircraft was a B777-200. Must admit I was a little disappointed with the level of service which I found to be a bit inconsistent. The cabin manager and a couple of the staff in the business cabin were excellent but were let down by a couple of their colleagues who looked like they were just going through the motions. One of these was an older member of the team who just didn't seem to have the friendly disposition and level of service you would expect when travelling in a premium cabin. The positives were the food and wine which was excellent. The negatives were the bed and the IFE in my seat went unserviceable fortunately there was a vacant seat so I was able to move over to that! When it did work the bed was of a good quality and the IFE had a good screen and wide variety of choice. If they are going to do a personalised service they need to get the persons name right as after I had corrected the flight attendant with my name I was then referred to as someone else later in the flight.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,yes

The 11 hour 20 minute flight from Osaka to Amsterdam on a Boeing 777 was the most uncomfortable I've ever been. The problem wasn't the leg room which was similar to most economy cabins it was the width of the seat and the actual comfort of the seat - it's the first flight where I've experienced backache. When I transferred in Amsterdam to a KLM Fokker 70 to fly back to Leeds it was bliss the economy seats were like padded armchairs.

When almost there I glanced at a screen showing departures and saw that Gate 27 was now showing for my flight. I stopped an airport employee showed him my boarding pass and the screen and asked if he could find out where I should be. After a phone call he said I should retrace my steps and go to Gate 29 which I did. Once there an official announced that our departure time was now 9.15am instead of 7.15am and they would give us a voucher to get some refreshments. I returned to Gate 29. We boarded our flight at approximately 9.50am and departed at about 10.10am. All I was offered on that flight was tea coffee or water. The arrival time in Auckland had been 12.15pm and we arrived at about 4.00pm. The other complaint I have is that the hand control for the screen at my seat showed ERR and did not respond to any selection. I signalled to a young male steward I needed help and after showing him the problem no attempt was made to reset it and the attitude was extremely offhand.

They ended up scrambling our seats so we had to sit at opposite sides of the plane. When I asked the lady why our seats had be switched she replied in the rudest tone possible told me ""if I would have just read the fine print we wouldn't be having this conversation"" - if it wasn't an airport I would have not just taken my seat. Absolutely rude and uncalled for, did not want to explain what was going on. It is what it is though I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone and will pay the extra $50 to fly Alaska from now on!",Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Seattle,December 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,7.0,Claudio Rallo,19th April 2015,I flew AMS-LHR-YOW on April 2nd and return on April 12th. Both were BA/AC interline flights. The BA flights and the transits at London Heathrow from T5 to T2 and vice versa proceeded very smoothly. Now my comments on my experience with Air Canada on this trip: Air Canada uses the Boeing 767-300ER between YOW and LHR. Despite this plane showing its age it's always a very sturdy and reliable plane no wonder that many airlines are still using them regularly on long haul routes. On my outbound flight the captain gave accurate cockpit announcements and staff members on both flights were very attentive and professional. Food snacks and refreshments were plentifully provided throughout the flights. My only issue is with the seats which were uncomfortable and there was very little legroom. Otherwise the meals were decent by airplane food standards and Air Canada offers a great inflight entertainment service keeping you busy on a 7-hour flight. I travel to Canada at least a couple of times a year and previously I used KLM travelling to Ottawa with a stopover at YUL. The route I took with Air Canada this time works out better for me personally and overall I am quite well satisfied with this airline. Will use them again in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,,T Hughes,15th July 2014,KLM 1845 from Amsterdam to Vienna on of July. We had booked the flight over a month before the flight departure date. Upon online check-in one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear. We had to ring up customer support as the online check in gave no other seating options and asked to change this so that we could sit together. We were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. We were also told if we got to the airport early the check-in staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. We arrived at airport check-in more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. We were also told that we had to pay 30 Euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online (but we couldn't do it online or else we wouldn't have been able to change our seats at the airport!). We discussed our experience with the lady at the check-in desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. So we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 Euro per suitcase. We then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 Euro each to sit in an 'Economy Comfort' seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. Long story short: this two hour flight cost us $900 AUD up front to be seated nowhere near each other. When we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra $120 AUD. Would never ever fly again nor recommend to anybody else.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Air Canada,10.0,G Neale,30th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I had an excellent experience flying with Air Canada from Newark to Vancouver. Check In at the airport was well organized and I enjoyed spending several hours in the Air Canada lounge. The food and wine was excellent and I got a fair amount of work done and enjoyed doing some reading. The Boeng 787is a beautiful plane. The business class seating is generous and comfortable. I particularly like the large screen and the choices with AC's IFE. The staff were friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the food (chose the beef and enjoyed the smoked salmon), dessert and appreciated the choice in wines. I recognize one of the attendants from a flight to Mexico and we had several nice chats. Also, the Chief Flight Attendant took time to speak with the passengers in the cabin. I've decided to go for another trip to New York City.

One of the stewards didn't want to talk he just indicated questions by nodding. The flight was not completely full but the crew seemed to be strained - maybe due to problems with the entertainment system - so that they only seemed to care for the guest who couldn't use the entertainment. I am used to a much better service provided by Lufthansa - my last flight to NY in September this year for example was one of the best flights I ever experienced - the crew was very attentive the purser introduced herself to me and offered me another seat.

Jetblue Airways,2.0,M Beale,1st July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Never Again! I travel from NJ to Boston several times a year to visit family. Since I have 2 small children, ages 4 and 7, sometimes I fly because it is generally quick and easy. The Newark to Boston flight was slightly delayed and my tv did not work but was otherwise uneventful. The trip home from Boston to Newark was a nightmare. My family lives over an hour from the airport and on the drive I got a text from the airline stating the flight will be delayed an hour. We were having some bad weather so that was understandable. I just had to try to entertain my kids for a bit longer in the airport. We boarded the flight at the delayed time and sat on the aircraft for over half an hour just to be told by the pilot they did not get clearance from Newark and ""it may be another hour"" for take off. They let us deplane. After dragging my kids further around he airport to get snacks and games,I noticed that every single JetBlue flight in the terminal was extremely delayed. We returned to the gate to see a big cancelled on the flight board. No announcement made. We were then told to go to customer service to see about getting another flight. After sitting in an airport for hours, I now had to drag my kids to another spot to wait in a very long line. At the desk, the rep told me the flight was canceled because the delays caused the crew to ""time out"". Basically they up and left stranding a whole plane of people with nowhere to go. The rep offered me options on another flight which would land at a NY airport over 2 hours from my home or an 8 pm flight that she told me would most likely be delayed. Neither were reasonable options for my situation. I chose to take a flight at noon the next day since my kids were at their limits of patience. I asked for compensation since I would have to get a hotel for the night and was told no it was not their fault since they canceled for ""weather"". (Seems to me like the crew abandoning ship was why they canceled). Meanwhile other airlines were flying no problem. Now I had to drag my 2 exhausted kids through the airport to reclaim my bags and hope to secure accommodation for the night. I was told that most of the hotels at the airport were booked but the reservation agent at Logan found me a hotel 10 miles outside of the city. We had to wait for a shuttle during rush hour in the rain. A 15 minute ride turned into 40 minutes. What should have been a quick easy 45 minute flight turned into a 24 hour nightmare. It was needlessly stressful and exhausting.I felt like I was left stranded with 2 small kids. It had been a couple of years since I flew JetBlue and I used to love them. Not anymore. From the other reviews I read it seems like my experience is not uncommon. I will pay extra to use United next time, or Amtrak. I will not be using JetBlue anymore.

Had them changed and the new ones didn't work. Turns out the socket for the earphones in my seat was broken. So no inflight entertainment for me for the whole flight unless I was prepared for visuals only. Then got a cup of coffee in a filthy cup. Admirals Lounge in JFK is a joke. Pretzels cheese carrots apples some juice and coffee. That's it. You have to pay for anything else at airport prices. Then they looked for $10.50 for a glass of wine. I thought the girl behind the bar was joking. She wasn't. She reluctantly told me that one wine was complimentary and she begrudgingly served it.

United Airlines,7.0,V Blaxell,14th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Melbourne via Los Angeles with United - the worst things about this route are the terminals and the United Clubs. D terminal at IAD is little better than a Quonset hut with carpeting, and Terminal 7 at LAX is a smelly, dirty disgrace made even worse by blaring security announcements every few minutes. The United Clubs in both places are old, tatty, dirty and full of people having loud, self-important conversations on cellphones since UA does nothing to regulate this kind of conduct. The Boeing 772 service to LAX was fully loaded, boarding was orderly, except that the cabin crew did nothing to assist disabled passengers to get seated and sorted before the rest of us got on. It was the same with disembarkation at LAX, so the aisles were brought to a standstill by poor people with physical limits trying to get on and off with the rest of us. The 772 was old and showing it. Things did not work. My IFE system went on the fritz. An FA willingly reset it and then checked, and when it still did not recover, gave me a coupon which I later used online to add 5,000 points to my Mileage Plus account. The inflight wifi also did not work for me 90 percent of the time, but my neighbour could use it it, albeit with very slow up and down speeds. One has to apply online for a refund. The Boeing 787 LAX-MEL was still new and fully functional, and this time the food was edible, though the portions were minuscule, and with dinner service about 1 hour after lift off and breakfast about 1 hour before landing, the 12-13 hours without food in between seemed long, even to me who is not a big eater, though one can buy food from the food for purchase menu. The crew on this leg were short on customer service skills, barking out requests, never a ""please"" or ""thank you"" and not a single hydration round. They seemed pretty sour about something, but when I went to the rear galley to find an empty restroom, a few of them were sitting around and chatting in a very jovial way with each other. Toilets not maintained at all for the 15 hours. Even so, we were on time, things went efficiently, the IFE choices were good, and the IFE system on the B789 was very good.

United Airlines,1.0,T Matson,17th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Cleveland to Washington. This was the absolute worst trip of my life. This airline doesn't allow you to take a carry on larger than a backpack, so I had to check my small suitcase that any other airline would consider a carry on. My flight that was supposed to leave at 1:00pm was delayed 11 times and cancelled once. When I was finally able to fly out it was 10 pm. When I arrived in Washington I was told that they had left my luggage back in Cleveland and it would not arrive until 11 am the next morning. This was a problem because I had a meeting at 10 am the next morning. United said they would update me about my luggage, but they never did.

American Airlines,1.0,G Lieberman,12th June 2014,I just completed a multi city international round trip with American. 2 international flights and 3 domestic. So the international (from South America to Miami) was an overnight flight. The plane was old and the ceiling TVs stayed on all night. No sleep. All of my domestic flights were either delayed re-routed or cancelled. The first from Tampa to DFW was cancelled due to no oxygen. To top it off at my final destination back in South America one bag was delayed (hopefully not lost) as it was accidentally put on a LAN flight to Lima. 5 days later I am still waiting for it.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,no

The 777-300ER and 787 planes are modern and keep the noise levels low. Was slightly dissapointed by the fact that in 777-300ER Qatar Airways followed other airlines and switched from 3-3-3 layout to 3-4-3 layout obviously reducing the space and cutting the Economy class seat. However, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, the seats are modern with thinner padding but still comfortable. The IFE needs some improvement in the overall GUI and film choice. The food quality deteriorated over the last 3 years that I have flown with them. Portion's seem to be smaller and the food not as good as before.

They switched my flight to Alitalia and this is where my nightmare began. I flew from Heathrow and transferred in Rome to Cairo Egypt. Before I boarded my flight I went to the desk to make sure my suitcase had been transferred to the flight. The gate attendant looked on the computer and said yes your bag is on board. I then boarded the flight transferred in London and made it too my final destination Cairo. The flight from Rome to Cairo was very rocky and I couldn't wait too get off that plane. I then proceeded to baggage claim to pick up my suitcase. Every bag came out and mine was no where to be found. I started to panic because I was meeting friends in Cairo and we were on a 14 day trip to Egypt, Israel and Jordon. I went to look for baggage office and there was know one there except a lady giving out paper missing luggage reports. No computers nothing. I pleaded with her that this was an emergency and I needed to get my suitcase back immediately because I was on a 14 day international trip. She assured me my bag would be on the next flight and they would immediately send my bag to my hotel in Cairo. I felt relieved went to my hotel two days passed no bags no nothing. I tried calling the number on missing luggage report that she gave me know one answered. Tour guides,manager of hotel everyone tried calling to get my luggage back. Finally I realized they gave me a number that wasn't being answered at all. I had another flight and went back to Cairo to file a police report. I reported my luggage stolen because the airline gave me false contact info. I had to borrow clothes from my friends I was traveling with. Buy clothes from street markets when I could. I was stressed out but still hoping they would return my luggage well long story short. Alitalia airlines kept my luggage the whole 14 days I was traveling. My bag was finally returned to me when I got back to USA. It was twenty five days later. I had put a card on my luggage with my contact info it had my name home phone number, address and email address. They never contacted me at all instead they let my luggage sit in a luggage room the whole time with my info on it. What did I get from this airline. They said we're sorry you were inconvinced. To date I have received nothing no compensation for severely disrupting my dream vacation. This is the worst airline on the planet. I wouldn't trust them with anything. Don't give them your bags.

Alitalia,5.0,C Mariatti,12th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Rome. On the return flight from Los Angeles we traveled in Premium Economy having requested and obtained a flight upgrade. Having had the upgrade we thought we would enjoy all the privileges of this class of flight including the possibility of embarking 2 bags of 23 kg, but at the airport of LAX we learned that this was not included in the upgrade. Now, if the company offers me an upgrade (through participation in an auction) it should also specify which services the customer has access to and which are not. Needless to say, at the airport to our grievances they shrugged and the conclusion was that we were able to take two extra bags as members of the Ulisse Club. Frankly it was so many years that I did not travel Alitalia and in this circumstance I remembered why. Another flaw that I found is the bad grace of the stewardess and the bad conditions in which the toilets are left, which after so many hours and so many people who frequent them become unrealistic. Finally my seat, but it was bad luck, did not remain reclined but moved continuously upright. IT: Sul volo di ritorno da Los Angeles abbiamo viaggiato in Premium Economy avendo chiesto ed ottenuto un upgrade della classe di volo. Avendo avuto l'upgrade noi pensavamo di godere di tutti i privilegi di questa classe di volo tra cui la possibilitÃ  di imbarcare 2 bagagli da 23 Kg, invece all'aeroporto di LA abbiamo appreso che questo non era compreso nell'upgrade. Ora, se la compagnia mi offre un upgrade ( attraverso la partecipazione ad un'asta) dovrebbe anche specificare quali sono i servizi a cui il cliente ha accesso e quali no. Inutile dire che in aeroporto alle nostre rimostranze hanno fatto spallucce e la conclusione Ã¨ stata che siamo riuscite ad imbarcare due bagagli in piÃ¹ in quanto membri del Club Ulisse. Francamente erano tanti anni che non viaggiavo Alitalia ed in questa circostanza mi sono ricordata del perchÃ¨. Un'altra pecca che ho riscontrato Ã¨ la malagrazia delle hostess e le cattive condizioni in cui vengono lasciate le toilette, che dopo tante ore e tanta gente che le frequenta diventano improponibili.

American Airlines,1.0,J L Ray,10th May 2015,"Just returned from a two week trip to China using AA into Beijing returning from Shanghai. We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious.

Lufthansa,3.0,Vukmanovic Goran,3rd March 2014,"Flights LH720 and LH721 from FRA to PEK and back. Everything written regarding the Lufthansa business class seats is absolutely true. Outbound flight on new 747-8 with new business class seats which are flat beds. Unfortunately if you are satt near the window in flat bad position it is almost impossible to get out of the ""bed"" without disturbing your co-passenger. On top your feet are very squeezed in the tiny hole at the bottom of the bed. Food choice OK as well as beverages. IFE system I would rate as average. Flight on time. Inbound flight - nightmare instead of 747-8 it was old 747-4. As I checked in online nobody at the counter mentioned that the plane was changed and consequently my seat. Departure late for more than an hour. Old business class seats which are a disaster if you have the idea to sleep during the flight (not flat bed and very uncomfortable). Entertainment system was not working for more than two hours of the flight as needed to be reset. Food on the same level as outbound flight. No soap in the toilette. At the end arrived on time to catch my connecting flight.

After reading some of the horror stories previously I wasn't looking forward to the flights. The day got off to a bad start with a 2hr queue for checking in at Manchester airport, and then to find out that the seats that my wife had booked online (window seats) were then not available to us and we were put in the centre section - although one of us would be sitting by ourselves, this was rectified on board with another passenger who kindly swapped. The flight was on time and we made it with 20 minutes to spare thanks to the mass chaos at check in, the plane looked new and clean from the outside, but once inside the aircraft all that changed, and you stepped back in time to the 1990's. The cabin was dreary and their was also a stale smell in the air (like a pub carpet), and also the entertainment system may have well been non existent with the overhead TV's (no seatback entertainment here). The flight was good, the cabin crew were good - friendly and no attitude, the food was good, and also the refreshment service was no problem (free drinks). The seats may have been old, but they were spacious and plenty of legroom in front. Would I fly with AA again - if I got the same level of service then yes, if it was a dirty aircraft that desperately needs dragging into the modern age for a long haul flight then no.

American Airlines,6.0,Jerry Bolton,10th September 2015,"La Paz to London via Miami. The main reason for this review is that American Airlines now check your baggage through. After booking the flights, I had a warning from a friend that you not only had to go landside when transiting, but you had to collect your bags to check in again. I had minimal time in (Dallas on the way out) Miami and AA reservations confirmed that baggage could not be checked through. They now do so and I made the LHR flight with about 30 minutes to spare (unhelpful immigration staff). The flights were uneventful and unimpressive, but cheap and got there in reasonable time. The only real gripe is the entertainment system. The Boeing 777 flights provide a woefully short number of films, documentaries, comedies, dramas and any choice would get a 'you want to watch it from 20 minutes in or wait for the next one in 10 minutes?' Sound and picture quality are very poor. The Boeing 757 flight from La Paz was a throwback to the 80's - fold down screens in the aisle, where you will watch the only showing, unless you're sitting in a window seat and you can't see the screen anyway. Point I did like was that, for a cheap cost, you can buy a better seat well in advance. As said, my flights to Peru and back from Bolivia were a lot cheaper than alternatives so if that means the TV options are rubbish, so be it.",Boeing 757 / 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,La Paz to London via MIA,September 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,yes

Not once did we depart on-time. Newark was a disaster. We had our flight cancelled obtained a second flight but the customer service rep never suggested we try to get an earlier standby flight. Nobody called us from standby until I questioned the boarding attendant minutes prior to takeoff but managed to get onto the plane only to sit on the runway for over an hour because of a backup radio malfunction which ultimately caused the flight to be cancelled. After 7 hours we made it to Boston. Going home we arrived in Chicago and again on United's commuter connection we had another 2 hour wait while something on the plane was fixed. Service was poor especially in Newark where there were two hundred people waiting at customer service to rebook and two reps staffing the computers talking on a phone and letting a plane load of customers wait.

Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left. Another associate came in talked to the associate at the counter and walked away. Flight arrives late and then I have to wait 7 hours for another flight to Boston.

American Airlines,1.0,E Klimen,30th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | My university booked 45 people on a flight from New York JFK to Santiago, Chile, with a layover in Miami. When we arrived at the airport (luckily with plenty of time), the kiosks could not process our confirmation code and many of us got error codes. Customer service slowly and painfully manually checked us all in and took our luggage. When returning from Santiago, we arrived at the airport ready to encounter the same issue. This time, the kiosks once again did not work, but the customer assistance agent would not let us all enter the line to get manually checked in. Instead, they roped off the entrance to the EMPTY line and ""had to talk to the manager first."" We explained that there were 45 people under one reservation code and the kiosks would not check us in, but they were adamant about having each of us wait for the kiosk to give us an error code and then get in line for customer service. I explained that we would all miss our flight if all of us had to wait in line for a kiosk, error code, and then for customer assistance. After ""talking to the manager,"" the agent offered to check half of us in, not that this makes any sense because all 45 of us had a ticket number to board the same plane. Finally, after ignoring the agent and just entering the line, our bus driver came to argue with them as well to let the rest of the group through. The agents denied that 45 could possibly be under one confirmation code and have a group reservation (Why else would 45 people show up at the airport together?). Eventually, they let everyone through, did not find more agents to assist the line, and clearly had not communication amongst themselves. Luckily, everyone got through security in time for the flight, but I'm sure if some of us hadn't just ignored them all together, some would not have. The woman also printed my first boarding pass twice instead of printing my boarding pass for both legs of the trip, thank god the kiosk before security during my layover worked, or I would have missed my connecting flight since there were no attendees at the counter in Miami.",,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Santiago,March 2017,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Ken Waldroup,14th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Charlotte to Gander via Toronto. I am one of 6 in our group that have the same complaints. In Charlotte, Air Canada charged us an antler/horn fee of $150 instead of a $50 firearms fee when we checked our guns for a Moose hunting trip to Newfoundland. They tried to tell us since we had rifles that we had to pay an antler/horn fee because they were hunting equipment and they no longer fall in the firearm category. We even got a TSA agent to try help us talk sense into the girls at the bag check but they wouldn't listen. Then we were told our luggage would go direct to Gander but we had to check guns in Toronto thru customs. Every person that we talked to employed by Air Canada gave us a different story concerning our guns and our luggage. In Toronto instead of bringing the guns out to us for an ID check we found them in the baggage claim area that anyone could have picked them up. Then in Toronto customs we saw all our luggage stacked in the corner that we were told would go straight to Gander. Also Toronto customs only had 2 people working the 15 check stations and 40 people were lined up for connecting flights and we barely made ours. We checked our luggage and guns again but when we got to Gander all 9 bags including our guns were lost. We missed a full day of a $4300 hunt waiting on luggage and guns. They didn't make it to the airport until the next evening. Then on the return trip home to Charlotte we were charged the correct firearm fee but we watched a girl throw our gun case on the carousel in Charlotte. Hard enough it hit and bounced almost off and another passenger caught it and placed it back on the carousel. These are very expensive guns and scopes. Also she did not bring the guns to us and check our ID to release them to us as she was supposed to. Anyone could have taken them again. We tried to file a complaint at the airport and talked to her supervisor and he said he would reprimand her as that was uncalled for but that we would have to file an online complaint. Also a brand new luggage bag came back with the handle ripped off. And the flight from Toronto to Charlotte had a problem with the fan that pressurizes the cabin so it was so hot on the plane you couldn't breath. It did get better as we flew but the pilot had to fly at a low altitude according to the flight attendants because of the cabin pressure issue.

Air Canada,6.0,T Eldem,8th July 2014,LHR to YUL on Boeing 777. Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

American Airlines,8.0,Bielli David,24th February 2014,"LAX-LHR return in Biz. AA put their new 777-300ER on this route and I have to say that they are nearly on the top of the market with this product. Lounge at LAX - not so great I am EP the highest but have to admit the lounge is lacking lots of food options. There were nearly none except few sandwiches. Compared to BA First class in Terminal 3 which is not their best the AA just does not stack up. The aircraft itself is great. Biz has walk-up bar which if the flight attendants are not too lazy has constant food. And this is where it becomes tricky. Flight attendants on AA are hit and miss. I flew them 5 times in the past few months. The same route. Sometimes you get great serving people who really care and would do anything for you and then you get a lady like I did who when I walked up to the bar in the middle of the flight and asked for a glass of water - since there was none anywhere had to close her game on her iPad annoyingly lifted her eyes and proceeded to look. When she found the bottle she slammed it on the bar and said "" You will be able to pour it yourself - I hope"". Seat itself is great. I recommend row 5 window - it has an extra space to store your stuff. Plenty of room to stock things up. Food - really great for biz class they elevated their game with wines as well. I can't fault them for anything in terms of hard product. The choices of movies - great. I am comparing to my recent trip on BA which had about 1/3 of movies. That really surprised me.

Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full.

The women at the gate literally argued that there were no delays with people who had waited hours with no update. Leaving over 100 people scattering to change their connecting flights.

Once it finally boarded and took off the crew never acknowledged the delay in any way just wished us a nice flight! Toward the end of the flight they announced gates for those who had not missed their connections. Never acknowledged that some of us had gave no instructions whatsoever. When I found a service desk the guy printed out my new boarding pass (for a flight the next morning) and threw it at me only when I asked did he blurt out something about going through passport control then to the hotel desk. By then it was late at night three PP control guys serving a huge crowd people starting to get angry and shout. I was afraid I would get through PP control then not get any help and be stuck outside the airport so instead I headed for the wonderful Turkish Airlines VIP lounge. There they refused to give me one of the sleeping rooms but did offer a ""five star hotel"" and a shuttle if I left the airport. By then it was so late that I would barely have time to get to the hotel before it would be time to return to the airport for my early flight so I hung out in the lounge all night. In all this time there was never the slightest apology for the delay or even a smile.

Air Canada,1.0,M Coram,29th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Brussels to Toronto via Montreal. Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for. After complaining to the flight director who was charming but useless and mouthing platitudes that she would write it up in her report, I braced myself for the arrival of the pasta dish that no one else wanted and that I was going to be saddled with, unless I wanted to be hungry for the next seven hours. It arrives, the foil is removed and it is dry at the edges. I to eat the bun and lettuce with six small slices of red pepper. The dessert is artificially creamy with peach bits that has some pleasant taste but which hardly provides fulfilling sustainment. An hour before landing we are served a savoury pastry in a cardboard box. Mine is a Chicken Fajita. I look at the writing on the box and it says it is made in the UK with ingredients as silicone dioxide to prevent anti-caking and colour - it also says this Fajita is made with chicken from Brazil. I found out that if you try to use the business class toilets up front, you will be castigated and sent to the ones at the back of the aircraft.

Air Canada,1.0,Patrick McHugh,5th November 2014,Today I was on a connecting flight with Air Canada from Boston to Vancouver through Toronto. The flight to Toronto was delayed and I asked whether I would be able to make the connection which I was assured I would. On landing in Toronto I made it to my connecting gate 20 minutes before takeoff and they had already removed me from the flight. Colleagues who arrived at the gate behind me were not removed from the flight. The explanation from customer service was that they were in business class and I was flying economy. Needless to say the flight I was on and made the connection to was now full as was the next flight making me late for a meeting this evening.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Lufthansa,6.0,M Gruenig,27th July 2014,LH 418 6 July 2014. Overall pleasant flight on the 747-8. Anybody with any financial means should avoid economy. The problem is not with the airline but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting wall sidings). As usual the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA.

American Airlines,2.0,Laura Rodriguez,13th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I normally do not review, however beyond disappointed in the service received!!! Flying out of Cleveland, OH to Corpus Christi, TX, my connecting flight had an hour and 20 minute layover in Dallas, TX. Not only was my flight delayed 3 times, which would have left me missing my connecting flight by 30 minutes, my connection was delayed and I missed that by 10 minutes thanks to waiting for my plain to taxi. American Airlines was nice enough to put me up in a hotel for the evening (even if I had no clothes, toiletries, etc since everything was checked, I at least had a bed) my connecting flight showed a printed time of 0820, American showed the flight on their screens as 0850 on time (would have been nice to know since I could have afforded the extra sleep). On the shuttle over to the airport finding out from flight attendants that American Airlines is up for contract reviews so all of their flights have been ""coincidently"" late/delayed for malfunctions. Low and behold my flight home has been delayed twice now, first to the AC once again not being to the pilots liking, and now because he'd like to check the brakes again (I'm all about safety so by no means am I upset over the last issue). However what spurred the outrage was when I decided to speak with Customer Service. I politely and softly asked if we would possibly be leaving in the late morning/early afternoon so I could make arrangements for both meetings and travel back home, only to be rudely yelled at the attendant at the gate quite loudly stating that the brakes were an important part of the plane. Now I can understand if there had been multiple guest that asked rude questions how her ""customer service"" skills could have been strained, however no one had spoken with her and her immediate answer was defensive, hostile and rude to a simple, polite question, American Airlines maybe while you are ""negotiating contracts"" you take your guest who faithfully fly with you into consideration and retrain your staff in customer service skills to be slightly more understanding and just polite to the innocent bystanders that just want to get home to their families. Not only will this be my last flight with American Airlines, but I will not be referring then to family and friends. To those considering American Airlines.

Southwest Airlines,4.0,JoAnn Olson,4th July 2012,I flew from San Antonio to San Diego flight #2523 on 6/29/12. I was not familiar with their boarding system. I did not know what the number pole at the boarding area was for. I wish they had informed passengers that we need to stay in number order. The guy doing the boarding stopped me and made me wait while everyone in my group boarded. I thought that was very rude. I also did not know they put the menu in the back of the seat. When I ask the attendant what they have to drink she was very rude and told me to look at the menu. Their fare is cheap. The seats and aisle are very cramped. My flight was 30 minutes late. They take you from A to B - that is about it. My experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I always thought highly of Southwest but not anymore.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,4.0,no

The boarding was chaotic and took a long time, as it appeared more passengers had to change seats. The seat I was put in was the most cramped one on the plane. Once aboard the plane I told the purser about the situation, she refused to believe me and went out of her way to deny I even paid for an EconomyComfort seat.

Emirates,8.0,Chia Ty,23rd June 2014,21/6/14 EK354 DXB-SIN. Boarding not by zones this time and some confusion occurred at the gate. Middle aged aircraft by EK's standards 4.4 years old well maintained interior but my seat pocket had a bit of uncleared rubbish. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Due to this passengers kept pressing call buttons to ask for drinks. Snack service 1h15m after take off and drinks another 30m later. Breakfast was 3h before landing. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies same as DXB-CDG. This time the sandwich was rock hard and the cookies weren't as good they were soft and weren't baked enough. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach (Same as DXB-CDG) and fried noodles with siewmai. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff but was more bland this time creamed spinach bad this time. There were also fewer potato wedges and they were soggy. Fruits were fresh. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was good on this flight. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around twice after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. Landing was smoothest of 4 legs. After landing during disembarkation I requested to a cabin crew to allow me up to business and first class to have a look. She asked the chief stewardess and got a nod. She then enthusiastically showed me around the upper deck and I was amazed at how luxurious it was. I thanked her profusely after that. Good service from her.

At first by thirty mins, then an hour, then two and a half hours. They said they couldnâ€™t find the crew, or get hold of them. Ok seems weird but Iâ€™m sure it happens.

Lufthansa,8.0,Stefan Oelze,17th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,4.0,5.0,2.0,,2.0,3.0,yes

Then some ""newly hired flight attendant"" activates the slide - see the photo. Evidently once the slide has been deployed out the side of the plane, you can't just poke it back in and fly away. Also, who would have guessed that there isn't a backup plane available. So now we have to wait until 8pm for another plane to fly from Dallas to pick us up. Does it take 6 hours to fly from Dallas to Seattle? I think not. We are notified that we will miss all our connecting flights. The next seats available to Des Moines aren't until Tuesday or Wednesday. Well that isn't going too well with our employers, so we negotiate through a supervisor with ""finance"" to get reimbursement should we fly to another city and take ground transport home.

Emirates,4.0,Ramon Iglesias,26th August 2014,Traveled SIN-DXB-BCN and MXP-DXB-SIN on Economy. On the flight outbound nothing special besides the connection in Dubai the filthy and overcrowded toilets in DXB which is still not up to the standard of Changi in Singapore or HKIA and the wifi that I could never get going (and I wasn't the only one). On the flight DXB-BCN on the 380 they ran out of cold beers and had to serve warm beers declined the suggestion and opted for red wine which was also warm so I just asked for a glass of water hoping this one would be fresh. There seemed to be friction between the FA's as I was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didn't look very professional. On the way back from MXP we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. Nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded. Managed to get to my gate (after a long walk) and boarded the flight. Nothing special the meal trays seem a lot skinnier than you get on Singapore Airlines or Qatar. FA's doing their job and that's it nothing like Thai Singapore or Cathay they are young but not very service oriented. And last but not least they lost my bag. I am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but don't expect a whole new dimension it is just an OK airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated self-attributed reputation with below average delivery.

I purchased a ticket through STA travel more than a month in advance from Sydney to Santa Fe round ticket, including my Advantage Number, which I have had for several years. For some reason, even if for some flights I was located at the back of the aircraft, I was placed in all flights to board on group 8 (the group after the very low priority group, even though I had a 3-leg flight). This was a problem on the way back from Dallas to Los Angeles, when they run out of overhead compartments and tried to make me check my carry on all the way to Sydney (they did not offer valet bag checking). I tried explaining that I had a 6 hours layover in LA and then a very long flight to Sydney, and that I needed my carry on (get very cold on places, and was going to arrive to winter in Sydney), and that I did not understand how the system, knowing that I had a long flight ahead would place me in the last boarding group. After a very unpleasant moment with very unfriendly personnel at the Dallas airport, I was able to bring my carry on in some extra spaces available. Additionally, even I had purchased the ticket earlier, the system would not let me pick seats in one of the flights, so I had to travel in the mid seat, next to the bathroom. They should really try to improve customer service, and respect people paying full ticket fare in advance.

Because our flight to Istanbul was delayed, we missed my second flight to Manila.

They told us that we should wait in the airport till they book our tickets. So, we waited for 3 hours without any service and during this time the staff couldn't do it. Only when we found manager he told us that we can go to hotel service and get our tickets tomorrow, and by that time it will be booked. It seems that staff from Turkish Airlines who told us we should wait our tickets didn't know about such option. Next day we got our boarding passes to Bangkok, and staff told us that we should get our tickets from Bangkok to Manila on Turkish Airlines transfer desk in Bangkok. They didn't tell us anything about second flight - no time, no airline. We asked about this flight from Bangkok to Manila two times - the guy on registration desk and the girl on supervisor desk. We also asked about our luggage and they told us that it will be sent to Manila with us. When we arrived to Bangkok, we didn't find any transfer desk of Turkish Airlines). It took a long time to found someone from Turkish Airlines with help of airport service, and at that time it turned out that flight, booked by Turkish Airlines for us, passed some time ago.

American Airlines,3.0,Beth Kutcher,25th July 2015,"American is usually okay for me but they aggravated me this time around. I'm assuming the airlines set the flight times. We had a 2 hour layover which is usually enough time but due to the size and unecessary complexity I already reviewed the airport separately) of Miami airport, it was not enough time and we had to run to make final boarding call. I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo.

First leg of the outbound was delayed on the tarmac due to flow control into Delta's Minneapolis hub, where I was to transfer. Apparently this is not uncommon, so one wonders if the airline should adjust its schedule accordingly -- perhaps by disallowing short layovers -- which is the reason for an imperfect score. I arrived at MSP about 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. The Delta app said my gate was a 12-minute walk. However, I'd gate-checked my bag, so I was still in jeopardy of missing the connection. When I stepped off the plane I was met in the jetway by a Delta staffer who solved all my problems by escorting me to a car on the tarmac, where we grabbed my bag from the baggage handler, and shot off through a tunnel under the C and G concourses, directly to my connection.

Southwest Airlines,8.0,Lee Ho Seok,6th March 2013,CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected.

Travelling alone so I requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. Suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous. Other airlines like SQ are more flexible on such requests. No food served for babies even if you ask. Lastly, difficult to get help when asking assistance with my baby's milk. I had to carry my baby and go all the way to the pantry to get someone to assist me.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ARN to MNL,July 2016,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,no

My daughter flew to go to school oversees on a flight operated by American Airlines. The baggage claim ticket stated AA, but when she arrived at her destination, they would not help even though her luggage was lost on the AA leg of the flight. They would accept no responsibility, instead blaming the last leg of the flight which was with Iberia. Iberia will not respond at all about reimbursing expenses and AA will not offer any assistance. My daughter was in a foreign country without her luggage for 9 days. I called AA 3 times and they could not care less.

The customer service is absolutely horrible, staff is rude. I say make them sleep on an airport floor for a night, and then tell me they're sorry for the inconvenience. Every gate attendant I dealt with has been rude and not wanting to find flights for us, and acted as though I asked them to do something that was impossible. I would never recommend flying with Delta to my worst enemy. An announcement came over they were offering $500 vouchers for people to give up their seats, when we were offered nothing for them making us miss our flights.

The whole idea of ordering a Non-Vegetarian meal is to not get a Vegetarian Meal and not whatever the catering division decides so give me. It wasn't even Hindu or Asian in flavor! Why does Lufthansa bother to offer a specific Hindu Non-Veg Meal if in reality does not provide such a meal? The flight attendants were wonderful on board and did what they could. But they could only offer me yet another Non-Meat Pasta Meal because the other one offered was a Fish Meal which I do not eat at all. The food was the same as in regular economy class only served on china. The snacks for a long haul international flight was the same packet of pretzels offered with the pre-dinner drink and nothing more! Not that many years ago Lufthansa offered sandwiches, cake and fresh fruit and other nice things for snack on in long haul flights even in economy class!

Turkish Airlines,1.0,B Fowler,17th September 2014,"My husband and I took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between London and Antalya via Istanbul. We chose Turkish Airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than Easyjet etc. Check in at LHR was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient. The flight was delayed. In fact all four flights were delayed. We were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight (my husband is 6'6"") but were able to move once the flight was underway. As we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it. When I asked why (no explanation was volunteered) I was told the plane had changed. On boarding I was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband. Needless to say I moved once the flight was underway. No apologies from staff. On arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases. After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful.

However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell.

Now that I've taken two flights on this new aircraft and spoken to flight attendants it is clear that American has chosen the wrong aircraft for this route. Firstly, although new, the setup is so flawed and poorly thought out on many levels. The entertainment system is problematic with constant reboots needed and a very clumsy operating system. The whole experience is like renting a car from a budget company and getting a new car which is clearly made as cheaply as possible. The most serious issue is that due to fuel requirements this aircraft very often has to move passengers away from the front of the aircraft when loads are light. A flight attendant confessed to me that it happens with regularity including evacuation of the entire first class cabin. This is not a safety issue but an issue of very poorly thought out choice of aircraft for route.

No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant.

American Airlines,1.0,B Horton,8th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Boston. If you choose to fly American, expect delays and cancellations. Expect to hear excuses like overbooking, maintenance, or insufficient staff availability. Expect to be greeted by rude customer service agents when you try to make other arrangements. Expect a hard fight to receive any form of compensation for the inconveniences that they inflict on you. Expect to talk to numerous agents on the phone and at the airport, wasting hours of your time, until you eventually (if you have the patience to see it through) find that one person who will take five seconds of their time to help you. Expect some staff members to simply ignore you when you ask them questions. Expect that you will not make it to your destination at the time printed on your ticket. Even if you do make it onto a plane eventually (likely not the one you originally booked) expect it to be very cramped and uncomfortable. I have flown American Airlines numerous times over the past few years. Every time is a struggle. At Boston Logan Airport and Philadelphia Airport especially, the staff simply refuse to help when something goes wrong. They will instead resort to silence or walk away when you try to ask a question. At American Airlines, your problems are not their concern. Getting you to your destination on time is not their concern. Your comfort is not their concern. Their only concern is your money, which they will hold onto even when they fail to provide the services you paid them for.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Boston,February 2018,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,7.0,Neil Hopkins,7th September 2015,"The 2nd leg of 2 to Las Vegas with American Airlines. After travelling from Manchester and now feeling rather tired and weary, we couldn't wait just to get on the plane and get away. When we seen the plane at the gate it was a lot smaller than our first flight so we expected to be squashed up like sardines for 6hrs as the flight was fully booked. Again the flight boarded on time and we were greeted by the cabin crew, found our seats and to our surprise there was even more leg room than the first flight. The cabin was also fresh, clean and bright. Departure was delayed by an hour due to a technical fault with something to do with the fuel. Once up and away the inflight service commenced and free drinks were served which I wasn't expecting for an internal flight. The entertainment was in overhead TV's but I didn't expect seat back entertainment on a smaller plane. I didn't even expect TV's on the plane. We arrived in Vegas only 30 minutes late so that wasn't too bad after our 1 hour delay.

Seated in centre seats in a 1-2-1 arrangement. Cabin crew introduced themselves and brought champagne before take off. This flight has a dine on demand service. The crew took my order for lunch and drinks prior to take off. They asked when I wanted it - I said probably later as we had just had breakfast at the airport. They asked me to give them a 15 minute notice on when I wanted the food. Champagne and nuts served after take off. Lunch was soup, followed by an arabic meze. Main course was a spicy chicken dish and finally some ice cream. I declined the cheese course. Great choice of wines, Seating extremely comfortable and versatile. I managed some good quality sleep in the recline mode. The better cabin air atmosphere on the 787 was noticeable. Good selection of inflight entertainment although it took a little while to get used to the remote handset. Interactive flight display but no tail or belly cam. I used the wifi which was seemed to be free for only 15 minutes - easy to log on - and I managed to zap out a couple of emails. On time arrival. The crew allowed all the business class passengers to leave the plane first. Priority lanes at Doha directed us to an arrival lounge where we stopped for comfort break (you could also get refreshments here) then visa on arrival and immigration were at the exit from this lounge.

With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is ""no"". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is ""no"". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is ""no"". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours.

As a result I reached Stockholm on December 28 - after waiting in Sheremetyevo for more than 2 days and nights without any information food or lodging. The electronic screens displayed misleading information about many flights that were delayed or cancelled. I found out that my flight was about to depart merely by chance from my fellow travellers. After registration it was impossible to find any representative of Aeroflot in the international terminal D - they were just afraid to get out to the angry crowd and when they finally ventured they could not answer any questions and would not give their supervisors names.

Air Canada,2.0,Gordon Nettleton,3rd May 2014,"This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the ""pods"" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities. Use them.",,,Business Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,no

When booking online, by mistake I booked the return flight not one month later, but one year later. When I noticed the error I immediately contacted LH, but due to office closure hours etc. was only able to actually speak to someone more than 24 hrs after booking and was then told that I could only correct the return flight by paying an additional EUR65 change fee per Person (and additional cost as the corrected return date would only be available at an even higher tariff) â€“ the ticket price per person for this less than 1hr flight would have reached astronomical heights of more than EUR 400 per Person.

Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements.

The staff on the flight from Seattle to Dubai were rude and non-cooperative. I requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infant's meal. At the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggage's were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people. I had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. The tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. With a one year old how many hours can I handle the tray? On requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. All of them responded in a very arrogant manner. The passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. I had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. The screen in-front of my seat was not working. I just wanted it to be switched off. The crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. Apparently he came after 5 hrs.

Emirates,1.0,E Oscar,29th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. Iâ€™ve used Emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. I recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in Dubai with Emirates. The airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. It is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. There are always long queues for security checks. The terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it: Emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in Dubai. In my latest flight from Bangkok to Istanbul, the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai delayed 45 minutes, which means that I will definitely miss my flight in Dubai to Istanbul. Despite this fact, ground staff in Bangkok reassured me that I would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at Dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to Istanbul. When I arrived at Dubai airport 45 minutes delayed, the ground personal informed me that my seat to Istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. She told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm UAE time. With no further assistance she left. I had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. The response I received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. My latter complaints were totally ignored. Other issues with this airline: Their seat layout 3-4-3 seat, which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. Yes it is cheaper compared to other airlines and maybe should be listed in budget airline category.",,Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai,April 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Aeromexico,2.0,Fernando Suarez,20th January 2016,"TorreÃ³n to Mexico City, and the Captain said no word during the flight. Flight was delayed two hours because of traffic at Mexico airport. To my knowledge every day same airplanes land and take off, what traffic? After landing in Mexico, the plane was parked in front of the terminal (T2) for 35 minutes waiting for a gate! After that time the plane finally moved but it facing away from terminal, no airbridge to gate and a bus came for us. Ironically I saw at least three gates available at T2. Who knows what happened - no words from the captain. Finally, bags did not came out of the plane according to Sky Priority level, they do whatever they want and throw them in the order they want - where is the benefit? I know part of those issues is Mexico City airport's fault, but come on Aeromexico, you own that airport - especially T2 and you do nothing?",ERJ190,Business,First Class,TRC to MEX,January 2016,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,no

Alitalia,1.0,Dimitrios Zaxhos,31st July 2014,I flew with my wife from Thessaloniki to Rome and back. Both flights were delayed. Plane could be cleaner. As it is an international flight almost 2 hours the only thing you get is a drink and a small bag of biscuits. The coffee is awful. The staff could be more polite. The worst impression was on the return flight. We had only one suitcase which weighed 25 kg. Staff told us that we had to take 2 kg out because only 23kg was allowed. When we told her that we were 2 people but had only one suitcase much less than allowed (23x2 = 46kg) she insisted that we should take 2 kg out of the suitcase. So we had to open our suitcase at the airport. We will never choose this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,L Mcmahon,26th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I had an absolutely terrible experience with this airline. Originally my flight was delayed and at the gate we were being told that we were going to be able to board soon. The pilot would come on and keep pushing the boarding time back. Finally after spending over almost 5 hours waiting to board we were told that our flight was rescheduled and we wouldn't be able to leave until that evening. I was hours away from home and extremely upset. The customer service representative that I spoke to was extremely rude and claimed that there were no sooner flights with any other airline. I asked her to check and she kept saying that there was nothing. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she actually told me ""no I had to listen to her first"" before I could be transferred. When I eventually got in contact with a supervisor (45 minutes later) I requested to file a complaint in regards to how I was being treated. The supervisor refused to give me anyone's names, employee ID numbers, or any type of reference to my complaint and claimed it'd be noted on their file. After over two hours on the phone trying to get the issue resolved/being told they checked numerous times and no sooner flight was available I went online and found a sooner flight within 5 minutes! They claimed that they didn't see that flight and I was rescheduled for it. The whole ordeal was mentally and physically exhausting as I spent the whole day at the airport and ended up missing a day and a half of my trip to Budapest!

United Airlines,1.0,Ronald Bryant,14th September 2014,After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Lufthansa,9.0,Arthur Mosher,4th March 2015,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Served food half an hour into the flight then left for 7 hours without anybody asking us if we needed a drink - received a smaller snack 40 mins before landing which made you feel you had to rush as they where already standing waiting for the rubbish before you had finished.

I called AA and straightened it all out but when my luggage wasn't delivered to my home I had to call again and they said they had no record of the prior call and that they might not be able to get luggage delivered to me until next day.

Boarding on the two outbound and the two return segments went smoothly. Ground staff, and cabin staff were friendly, smiling, and even uttered words like ""please"" and ""thank you,"" which the AA employees forgot sometime back in the 1990s. Their uniforms were neat, clean and pressed. The boarding process, even in ""Zone 2,"" was organized and efficient, again in contrast to the priority boarding / rugby scrum I usually encounter at AA gates in Miami. DL pulls off boarding, somehow, with only one agent, which probably cuts labor costs and frees up more money for amenities like charging stations all over their Atlanta terminals.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,Simon Brind,19th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We booked a flight with KLM for our child using the Chaperone service, may I advise anyone not to do this. It cost us an extra Â£92 on top of the flight which was already more expensive than other airlines. The flight was due to land at Leeds at just after 10pm. However the flight took off and then due to a technical issue had to return to Amsterdam. This is ok but no-one informed us of this, then after waiting we heard the flight the cancelled. Again no one called to say our son was safe, the chaperone we heard took our son to the KLM lounge and left him there with the lounge staff, neither the chaperone or the lounge staff thought to use the big folder around the child's neck to call the parents. Therefore we were running around Leeds trying to find out what was going on. We had called family in Amsterdam whom had return to the airport to see what was going on there also but no-one knew. Eventually at 01.30 we tracked him down to the KLM lounge. KLM never offered any apology or a hotel as thy are supposed to. Why didn't the chaperone or lounge staff call us. To me this is nothing more than neglect. KLM took 2 weeks to answer my email of complaint and then took 2 more to come back with an offer of the flight payment up to Â£250 plus Â£92 for the service and Â£100 family day if we paid for it first and sent them the receipt. The way they have been with us I am not sure they would do this so wouldn't spend that extra money on the off chance. I believe this is totally unacceptable as we are entitled by eu law for the flight money back so they for company like this to offer a Â£100 voucher for child neglect just goes to show how much emphasis they put on childrens well being.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8.0,Alan Sargeant,22nd July 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Sochi to St Petersburg via Simferopol. Fast check in in Sochi and the flight left and arrived in Simferopol on time. This was a short internal flight so there was no inflight entertainment (was not expected). We were provided with a drink and a light snack - perfectly adequate on a short 80 minute flight. My seat was comfortable and I had adequate legroom. The plane was clean. Cabin staff on both flights had adequate English and were polite and friendly. Very slow check in (40 minutes plus) at Simferopol to St Petersburg and was not given any assistance or expedited check in (I was using a walking stick) so was in considerable pain when I actually got to the check in counter and so asked and was provided with a wheel chair to get from the check in counter to the plane. It was a longer evening flight again without any ife and a substantial snack and drink was provided early in the flight. The plane was clean and everything worked.

American Airlines,1.0,Basil Willett,11th August 2016,"The flight from Orlando to Philadelphia, AA1666 was delayed for over 1 hour, the pilot announced that he would try to catch up as he knew that there were people on board who had a connection to catch and would the passengers allow these people to leave the plane first. He made up about half an hour and the passengers ignored his request, taking us over 15 miutes to exit from row 30, giving us about 10 minutes to run from 16B to 269A. As an 83 year old man with an 81 year old lady, it is a wonder that we did not have a heart attack as the temp was 95 degrees. We reached A24 in time to meet a family of 4 who were walking back and informed us that they had shut the gate and would not wait. This was for flight AA734. They said they had been told to go to ""customer service"", a very long walk back. Here we were dealt with by the worlds worst and slowest typist. She proceeded to produce boarding passes for 2 of us and the 4 other passengers. She printed out 8 boarding passes, stared at each one and then threw them in the trash. She then produced 2 more, 1 at each side of the plane, I gave them back and she eventually gave me 2 for row 30. The other party asked for 4 seats together, not near a toilet, so they were eventually given 4 seats next to the toilets for the next day. This operation took her well over an hour, she then told us to go outside where a mini bus would take us to a ""hotel"". The 11 seater mini bus arrived with 7 passengers already on board and asked us to climb in, I sat on the edge of a seat with my foot in the door well and my lady companion sat on the spare wheel. We were then taken 25 miles to the ""Hotel"" which turned out to be a motel. By this time we were all very hungry as we had not eaten for about 10 hours only to be told that there would be no food until breakfast the next day. At this point I asked if I could make a phone call as there would be a taxi waiting for me in Manchester. Surprise, surprise the young man in reception informed me that they did not have a phone, I said they must be the only ""hotel"" in the world without a phone. He said they did not have an outside line. and there was no mobile network. As the taxi arrived in Manchester and waited 2 hours and returned home empty I have had to pay Â£125 instead of the Â£55 which I should have paid on the correct day. The next morning we were told that the only trip back to the airport was at 10.30 am so the 13 passengers again crammed into the 11 seater mini bus and we were taken back to the airport to catch our flight at 8.55 pm, after a half hour trip back we then had to wait in the airport we had to wait for aprox. 10 hours. I have travelled the world since I was 18 years old, have been delayed for 24 hours on three accasions but have never felt the need to complain before, but this experience was the most chaotic of my life so far.

I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane.

Air Canada,1.0,V Geetham,10th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney. I booked the ticket for my mother to travel Wellington, New Zealand from Vancouver, Canada. I booked in mid-February to travel in April beginning. My mother is old and has limited English. So i want her to travel hassle free for her vacation. The reason I choose air Canada 1) Price wise i can save about 150$ compared to the next cheap flight 2) I don't want to transit at Auckland because she needs to take a bus between international arrival and local departure at Auckland. 3) Air Canada's transit at Sydney only 3 hours and she can clear the bags at Wellington. My mother is Canadian and she doesn't require an ETA or transit visa to Australia if she has less than 8 hours transit. Exactly two days before the travel, we have received an email from Air Canada with a subject of itinerary change. No information inside the email except the itinerary. As per the new itinerary, transit at Sydney become 10 hours from just 3.5 hours. Same day evening we called the Air Canada to seek the reason. The person came to the phone didn't tell the reason. He just says the transit changed. Then we request for accommodation but he refused. Finally, we request the food voucher as a compensation for their possible mistake. He said they can provide that at the airport. ultimately its a useless conversation for us.( Nothing provided at the airport at the end.) Then only we realized my mother required an ETA or transit visa to Australia. Transit visa is free but it could take up to 5 days to get it. So we apply for ETA and luckily we received almost immediately. As per there website, this could take up to 12 hours sometime. We were not happy about Air Canada's behavior. So on the same day, we file a complaint with Air Canada and asked them to reply immediately since the next day my mother was flying. It is now almost 5 days and my mother in New Zealand for 3 days. But no reply from Air Canada until now. Money wise we are not losing anything but this was making us nervous. Unnecessary stress. Especially my mother. 150$ is lots of money. But I think next time I won't worry about even 500$.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Wellington via Sydney,April 2018,,,,,,2.0,no

Most recently, an AA flight canceled due to a crew member not showing up. I was placed on another flight the following day that had additional layovers because that was ""all that was available."" I was not in my home city so the AA agents gave me a voucher for $150 for cab fair/hotel but when I tried to use it, I was told I needed to pay out of pocket and contact AA Customer relations to get reimbursed. There is no phone number for AA Customer Relations (apparently they do not have phones), only email. I never got an email response and was never reimbursed. And, as if that is not frustrating enough, because I was added late to the alternate flight, I was the last to board, we somehow ran out of overhead space (on two separate flights) and they had to check my small (18"" round) carry-on. I pleaded with the flight attendant to let me keep it because it had valuable/fragile gifts in it but she insisted and it broke. I will never fly AA again.

On the first leg, I was seated in the very last row, and there was no window where I was sitting. The plane was very full, so I was not moved. The crew were nice and gave me extra snacks and drinks and apologized for the bad seat. The seats were rather uncomfortable, but they were tolerable for the flight time. Best part about the first leg was the IFE. Delta has free streaming from your device, so I was occupied during my entire flight. At JFK, we had a very short connection, of only 51 minutes, but the previous flight arrived 20 minutes early and the international flight left 20 minutes late, so we had plenty of time. Delta terminal at JFK, terminal 4, is nothing special, and lacks food options. The last leg, going to Pisa, was very good. The 757-200 is very good to fly transatlantic routes, and it had a new interior with mood lighting, IFE, and extremely comfortable seats. The touchscreen were very fast and responsive, with plenty of movies and other options. Dinner and drinks came out right away, and the options, the classic chicken or pasta, of which I chose chicken, was very good. Plenty of food and drinks to keep me satisfied throughout the 7 hour flight. I slept for 4 hours, which is a lot for me, I usually don't sleep on planes, but the seats were extremely comfortable. All the seats had USB and AC power, so I kept all my devices charged and ready for taking pictures. Flight arrived 20 minutes early, and all my baggage arrived, so I was very satisfied with this flight, much better experience than what can be found on American or United. Will definitely fly Delta and this route again.","CRJ900, Boeing 757-200",Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to PSA via JFK,June 2016,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,3.0,A Locher,28th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Houston to St Petersburg via Amsterdam. The flight was scheduled to leave Houston at 15:35 and the day of the flight an email was sent out stating there would be a delay until 17:00, this was fine. The delay was ""due to operational constraints"", which I understood as issues with the plane's usual functions. At the rescheduled time of departure, one would expect that the issue would be resolved. This was not the case. The pilot was able to explain to us that one of the engines was having mechanical issues and an engineer would assess the situation. After an additional hour or so of delay it was decided that the plane was not in suitable condition to fly. I'm grateful for the discretion here. The passengers were asked to leave the plane and given no direction afterward. They offered hotel accommodation for out of town visitors as reparation. After exiting the secure area of the terminal the crowd of passengers could not find anyone to help us. I personally heard four contradictory statements on who to contact to reschedule the flight. After calling the number provided to me by an unruly ground worker for KLM, I was put on hold for a Delta helpline and the call was lost. The second time I called I contacted a helpful worker who rescheduled the flight for the following day. Overall I was looking forward to this experience and it was nice until we were asked to leave the plane. After we left it was slightly chaotic and I was disappointed.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to St Petersburg via Amsterdam,January 2017,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,no

Lufthansa,1.0,Marie Dang,10th September 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Milan to Frankfurt. There was no group or seat boarding they just board everyone at one time! At the gate when you are waiting to be scanned the lady stopped every person to weigh their luggage and see if it fits into their sample size bin. We took our laptop and camera out of our carryon and the weight works but she said we can bring it because it won't fit into the sample bin and she made us check it in. Ridiculous and this causes boarding longer delay because she stops everyone. At check in they didn't even seat my husband and I together even though the seat next to me is empty.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Frankfurt,September 2017,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,8.0,A Thenayan,26th January 2015,RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier). I didn't go to the lounge in the DXB layover since it was from 12.00 am to about 7:00 am and I took a room in the airport hotel. The DXB-RUH flight was normal but the IFE was more outdated. I would say it was pretty good but there were a few flaws with the A380.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Sherry Carpenter,13th July 2015,"My son and I took a trip to New York leaving out of Shreveport and connecting in Houston. Not one time did the flights leave on time. Then on the return trip home, the flight attendant at the entrance of the plane was letting people on in groups. She sent my 9 year old son with a group in front of me. When I tried to tell her he was my son and didn't know where to go, she begrudgingly told me to ""go on then"", then went on to say ""it isn't like he's going anywhere anyway"". I told her I didn't like her attitude at all, and instead of being a professional, she continued to try to start an argument with me. Talk about lousy customer service.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,J Choo,24th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta. I experienced a Europe-US flight with Delta last year on A KLM ticket which was a good one. I would definitely consider flying with Delta again if the ticket price is competitive.",Bombardier CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo,February 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Our flight 1042 from Chicago on Dec 26 was delayed 1.5 hrs because one of the lavatories was found non-operational. However the crew learned about it after all passengers had boarded the plane. Boarding started on time on the way back from Montego Bay however after a third of all passengers had boarded the crew found out that 3 seats were non-operational. The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago. Could the problem with 3 seats identified before starting the boarding? I think Southwest has some opportunities for improving operations.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,7.0,David Bergstrom,15th December 2015,"Flew Delta Air Lines in First AUS-ATL-BOS. Flight to ATL on a newer B737-900 with Sky Interior. Nice Seats, a little less legroom, as Delta's domestic FC only has 37"" of pitch. Seat pretty comfortable, inflight entertainment is really good, on demand. No food service as this flight is 86 miles short of qualifying for breakfast, just drinks. Flight attendants were fine, yet hardly seen as once again, no real service. Hiked it to Terminal F to experience the Delta Sky Club there. This is a much better club, with some pretty good food offerings. ATL-BOS leg on a Intl configured B757, seat looks nice, is somewhat narrow, seat does not offer a full leg rest unless you recline into the full bed position., so a decent seat with a short leg rest, in the seated position. Lunch was a Turkey Pastrami sandwich, with bagged chips and a store bought wrapped cookie. Come on Delta, this is First Class, which, I pay for, as always, not an FF upgrade, prepackaged food for lunch. The food service is where Delta fails in comparison to American, my other preferred carrier. Delta's food tastes fine, yet presentation is totally lacking. Iâ€™m Elite with Delta, American and Virgin America, Deltaâ€™s gate employees tend to be very nice, but on board offering are not up to par.",,Business,First Class,AUS to BOS via ATL,December 2015,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting.

Paid for Economy Comfort for this leg and got the first row bulkhead seats which has tremendous legroom. In flight service is good and friendly but the hard products really needs to be improved. Second leg AMS-LHR in a very old and small Fokker 70. KLM should already retire this type of aircraft but they did maintain the plane well it was clean and in good condition. Only the noise of the jet engine really bothering us as we sit all the way in the back (Fokker planes has the engines near the tail of the aircraft) luckily the flight to London is only 45 minutes. A cake and drink service is provided during this flight. Third leg London Heathrow to Amsterdam in a Skyteam livery Boeing 737-900 good legroom and service is similar as the AMS-LHR where we get a cake and a drink.

Having pushed back from the gate we were told that a fuel pump had failed so rather than return to the gate and let us wait for the repairs in the lounge they parked us on a stand away from the terminal (Cheaper that way). Two hours later we finally left Birmingham. We noticed a 'Check Pilot' leave the flight deck to sit behind us for the flight to Newark. As we approached Newark the 'Check Pilot' re-entered the flight deck. He must have made either the Captain or First Officer nervous because we came in way too high and had to abort the landing, so around we went again by which time we had no chance of catching our flight to Orlando. The Captain informed us that the aborted landing was due to 'wind'. Yeh right, don't insult your passengers intelligence! On the ground we went to the United desk to get seats on the next flight down to Orlando. Desk clerk informed us that although we had four 'first class' seats booked and paid for, there were only three first class seats available, therefore one of the party would have to take a seat in 'coach'. OK these thing happen but we would obviously get a refund of the difference (about $250). That was in March 2015 - we made the claim in April 2015 on our return to the UK. Our travel agent received an offer from United of $100 and chose to make up the difference because of the trade we give him. We are still waiting for the refund from United! I travelled regularly between Birmingham UK and Jacksonville FL when the company was Continental with no problems. Since United have taken over, the airline is a disgrace.

I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn.

Emirates,7.0,S Neuhauser,4th December 2014,Vienna-Dubai-Manila and return in Business all on B777. Emirates is decent 4-star airline. The night flight out of Vienna was as one would expect - quick dinner service (good meal but nothing special) friendly staff (always addressed me with my name) but seats are far too narrow for business class because Emirates squeezes a middle seat into the centre row. On arrival in Dubai we were bussed to the gate (out of 4 arrivals/take-offs 3 were from bus gates and the bus ride takes quite a while). The business lounge was a disappointment. It is fairly large as it stretches across almost the whole first floor of the terminal but it is rather narrow and dull it overlooks the shopping concourse below (noise) there are showers but they are tiny. Strangely I had to ask for a non- alcoholic beverage at the bar as only juice and water are freely supplied but all hard drinks are self-serve. The onward flight to Manila was on a noticeably older 777 in a two-class configuration. The staff performance on this flight was outstanding. On the return flight one of only two washrooms for C-class broke which lead to queues. The plane was spotless and new but cabin crew performance was below par. Coats and jackets were handed back some 30 to 40 minutes before landing some pax had to keep them over their knees as the adjoining seat was occupied. Drinks and snacks were taken away all of a sudden without warning due to landing (still some 30 minutes away). Generally I would recommend them although I still prefer Qatar or Turkish when travelling into Asia.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

The number of passengers using the toilets warrants that someone clean the toilets, including the floor, at regular intervals during a 13 hour flight.

American Airlines,7.0,B Michaels,9th January 2014,Flew Business Class from Santiago Chile to Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777. I fly First and Business Class on airlines around the world and I don't have a problem at all with these Biz Class seats and amenities. Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special. AA service levels are average at best and can't come close to what is offered with the international airlines. The Admirals Club in Santiago was crowded and food selection poor.

That meant that the last flights had to be cancelled. They knew that from the start.

In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines.

Alitalia,1.0,J Manning,20th October 2014,October 10th from Rome to Toronto. We did not choose to fly this airline as we had bought tickets from British Airways however due to flight delays British Airways arranged for us to fly on Alitalia for the first leg of our trip. We were told incorrect information regarding seat availability and flight details from the Alitalia representative upon check-in and boarding the plane was a largely unorganized process which took well over one hour to complete. The plane was older (tube televisions down the center of the plane instead of seat-back screens) the cleanliness of the seats was sub-par and the sink in the toilet was clogged for the duration of the trip. For the first half of the flight the service on board was mediocre but acceptable however once dinner was served the service became non-existent. For 4 to 5 hours (on a 9 hour flight) the flight attendants hung out at the back of the plane and were deliberately ignoring the call button. If any passengers wanted a drink they were required to walk to the back of the plane and pour it themselves all while the flight attendants sat around talking and completely ignoring anything outside of their conversation. This expectation of self service is very inconvenient when someone with anything but an aisle seat would like a glass of water. I also wondered what passengers who require mobility assistance do in this situation? Flight attendants ignoring their passengers for half of an international flight is completely unacceptable. I will not be flying Alitalia in future.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,6.0,R Simon,31st December 2015,"VIE-AMS and three other short flights in Economy on Boeing 737-800, with three out of four flights delayed. Although I left ample transfer time of 90 minutes to catch my connection flights in AMS, the inbound delays resulted in mad run through the terminal to catch my connection both times, as Schipol has very long distances between gates. On the way out I had just carry-on luggage and made my connection at the last minute. On the way back I managed to reach my connection, but my check luggage did not, which was not really surprising. It was delivered the next day. Used Web check-in which working fine and KLM allows to pre-select seats during the reservation process at no extra cost. Checked luggage is charged extra, but prices are reasonable (EUR 10 per flight). FAÂ´s friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable for the length of the flights. Drinks served including beer and wine, with additional drinks on request. A cheese sandwich with no alternatives served on the inbound flights to AMS and biscuits/crisps on outbound legs. Forget the food, but the drink service was okay. Not a bad inflight product for European standards. However, room for improvement operational wise (delays and lost luggage). I had pretty much stopped flying KLM 10 years ago when service quality decreased and their previously good frequent flyer program became rubbish. While Flying Blue is still bad, KLM inflight service has improved.

The plane in ONT was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance causing nearly everyone to miss their connecting flight out of DAL. We had to wait in line (I waited 1.5 hours) at ONT to get on a new connecting flight out of DAL. The seats on the plane out of ONT were tiny old creaky and uncomfortable and staff were disinterested and unfriendly. There was no ""inflight entertainment"" to speak of. The worst came however when we arrived at DAL. Immediately upon disembarking we were informed that ""there are no hotel rooms left in Dallas"". The customer service reps feebly tried to console people with Nature Valley granola bars and cheaply-made cots but everyone was in a mostly miserable mood. I and many others ended up trying to sleep on chairs through the night. Very few people got any sleep. Terrible experience all around.

After a frustrating 2 hour delay, many passengers who had to use the restroom but were told to remain in their seats it was really annoying and frustrating.

American Airlines,1.0,L Chee,15th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I have never experience such a frustrating flight ever before. This is the first time I fly with American Airlines and will be the last time. My husband and I flew from Charlotte, NC to Santa Ana, CA and there was just delay after delay. I really didn't mind the delay at all because I knew that there was nothing that they could have done, what is done is done. But were there not any protocol to check the plane before letting passenger board the airplane? We sat there for a hour before they told us that everyone have to leave the airplane because they couldn't fix it and they need to give us a new airplane. So our flight was supposed to depart at 6:30 a.m. but we did not depart until 8:30 a.m. We got back on the plane and sit there for another hour because there was some ""computer glitches."" Obviously, we missed our connecting flight. Once we landed in Dallas to try to catch our connecting flight that we already missed, the staff handed us some new boarding pass to our new connecting flight which was a thumb up. But wait, that wasn't it. They gave us the wrong boarding pass, because while my husband and I waited for our plane to get boarded, we heard over the intercom, ""Last call for (our names) to Santa Ana."" My husband and I look at each other and was confuse on why do another flight have our names instead of the flight we were supposed to get on by the boarding pass the staff hand out to us. Well, we couldn't complain because it was an earlier flight or we will have to wait for another hour, but we were really concern about our baggages. When we arrived to Santa Ana, we did got our baggages, so that was maybe one thing that AA did right. On our flight back home, everything was going well. The flight were on time, no delays, we didn't have any problem. But once we arrive to Phoenix for our connecting flight, there were some problems. When I handed that staff my boarding pass, I couldn't board, because I ""did not check in."" If I did not check in, how did I arrived to Phoenix from California? And how did I have my boarding pass in my hand? My mother in law and husband is checked in and able to board, but I wasn't able to when we obviously all checked in together. Obviously AA is horrible with delay, so they obviously bump me off the flight and give my seat to someone else that flight was delay. My husband was not having it, after throwing a little scene, they offered to give me a $500 voucher and a hotel room. Of course, I was not having it, time could not be bought. But thankfully another passenger volunteer to stay so I could take their seat. But it's ridiculous how my seat was given to someone else and they overbooked the flight. AA really need to work on their flight, not always being delay and screwing people over. Do not recommend this airline to anyone.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,S Silver,22nd December 2014,"My family my husband and I and our two children ages 11 and 14 are well seasoned travelers. We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be. I do know that I will never fly Southwest again.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,no

Flight left with 2 hours delay, due to snow and de-icing procedures at Amsterdam, which was beyond the control of KLM. The new business class at KLM is a major improvement compared to the old style, yet the 2 aside seating still requires that your you have to crawl over your fellow passenger when seated in a window seat. The seat itself is spacious and transforms to a comfy bed. Unfortunately not much stowage space around the seat. IFE system is decent. We had a wonderful purser in business class, very friendly. The 'Indische rijsttafel' was without a doubt the best food I have had on a plane. We avoided flying KLM for several years as they were far behind vis Ã  vis other airlines on their business class product but we did not have much of a choice on the Curacao travel, and I have to state that I was pleasantly surprised to experience that they have catched up.

American Airlines,2.0,E Hatton,9th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Jose to Nashville via DFW. The customer service of this airline has consistently been pretty terrible and rude. I was placed on standby for a flight and went to the gate desk a little early and told to come back after the current flight departed. Understandable, no problem (with the exception of the slight attitude the gate attendant had with my mere presence). I came back when my flight was supposed to be serviced, and again told the flight just needed to pull out of the gate and she could help me, again with annoyance that I was back. I stand back a couple feet to make it clear that I am ready when she is, and then proceed to listen to the gate attendant talk about vacation, travel, all other chitchat etc., for 30 minutes - ignoring that Iâ€™m clearly waiting for her. I approach and tell her Iâ€™d like my seat assignment, and she breaks from her social hour, and throws a boarding pass at me that was already printed! Why was she waiting to just hand it off? This employee had no interest in doing a key component of her job, in just being generally pleasant like a normal human being, and instead wanted to just loaf and chat with colleagues as her main job - all else an annoyance. Most American flights Iâ€™ve had were delayed, and I only reluctantly booked again because I have a lot of travel this month and wanted to stretch a budget.

Aircraft were average, typical Boeing 777 but I could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors, so seating was ok. I was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. Cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines, the performance was just average. The inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke, once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. On all 4 sectors only one meal was served, not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. Emirates competitor on flights to Dubai does a lot more with less crew. Duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again.

Most times I end up on Lufthansa, British Airways or SAS, who all have wider seats, bigger screens and power supply in their premium economy class (I avoid the US airlines for all it's worth). The additional leg space and seat width makes the difference for me. For the first time I chose to try KLM premium economy for my Houston to Amsterdam trip. What a disappointment! The seats were the same as in economy class, i.e. exactly the same width. The only difference was a few inches extra of leg space. If you choose an emergency seat, which costs less than the premium economy on KLM, you basically get a better product. The screens looked like they came from a different era, pixelated and tiring to look at. Also, there was no power supply at all.

Air Canada,1.0,Peter Clements,13th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Halifax to London Heathrow via Toronto. We booked a flight to London for my wife. We made sure it was the direct flight as well to make it easier for her. Also booked it early to make sure we got what we wanted. Near the departure date, we got an e mail to say that her itinerary was changed to via Toronto. I phoned the airline and they told me the flight had been taken off and said book another day or accept what you have. It was a take it or leave it situation. Of course we had to take it. So she endured a long and difficult day as she is less able and the connection was rushed and it was tough. Imagine her annoyance when she finally got to Heathrow to find the direct flight we previously booked arriving at much the same time! They also managed to lose her baggage! Contact with Air Canada customer service was difficult. No response to the web mail submission. Telephone calls just produced advice to resubmit the complaint - which I did and still no response. In the end I had to badger them on social media to get any contact. It took a week to get anything from them. Their response was that some time after taking our flight off, it was put back again and people who had that flight cancelled were not given the opportunity to return to that flight. So those who were wise enough to book early lost out, while those who booked late got what we were denied. They said that as a goodwill gesture they would offer us 15% discount on our next flight. Useless as we don't intend flying again this year. Hardly good will as it was their poor customer service that caused all this.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YHZ to LHR via YYZ,November 2016,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

The flight was ok it was with A380, the food was average, staff attentiveness was ok. My problem started in Dubai when I was about to take my connection flight to Philippines. I bought some duty-free items at Gatwick airport and more in Dubai Airport to take home. I wasnâ€™t told it was Emirates policy that they assess every passengerâ€™s hand luggage including items bought at the airport before you board the plane. The 7kg allowance prior to departure in London was more due to my duty-free shopping. I was told by the ground floor supervisor/manager that I have to reduce the weight of my hand luggage or pay $200 for extra weight or return my duty-free shopping but I refused to do so. If I donâ€™t pay $200 or reduce the weight I would not be allowed to board the plane.

During my last trip to Athens for the outbound flight they put two flights together - as a result I was not able to change flights online. Hence I had to call them up in order to change flights they inform that I had to pay an extra 65 euros if I wanted to fly in a particular flight and 20 euro if I wanted to fly with another flight.

The A319 is nothing special there, but great for an hour and a half flight. Service was great during the flights. The flight attendants were very accommodating for us, as we were flying with children. But, unlike some airlines Iâ€™ve flown with (ie. Qatar Airways) the staff didnâ€™t really go out of their way to make it comfortable for the kids. As for meals, I would rate them in the top 3 of airlines Iâ€™ve flown with.

Check-in on both flights was prompt and professional and seats which had been pre-booked were offered. The boarding was organised and although both flights were full this was straight forward and stress free. The seats are tight in economy but no more than other airlines. The price was very reasonable at Â£146 return and again was the main factor for choosing AZ. The flight offered a drinks service which was all complimentary but no food. Once again this is comparable to BA so no major grumble here. Overall I would recommend AZ on the short-haul product.

Air Canada,6.0,T Eldem,16th September 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Brussels to Montreal on Air Canada. Our trip originated in Prague with the first leg operated by Brussels Airlines so upon landing in Brussels we proceeded to the lounge. AC uses Brussels Airlines lounge which was very crowded and had very limited food and drink options. We proceeded to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and were met with a long queue for passport verification. When I went up to the counter to inquire if there were a separate line for business class passengers the agent simply responded by saying there was only one line and pointed to the back of it. We had somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 passengers ahead of us and there were only two ground agents performing the checks. After 20 minutes in the line I went up again and asked why they did not have a dedicated line for premium passengers like they do at every other European airport. In a rather sarcastic tone the agent simply said â€œthis is how we do it in Brusselsâ€. We finally got through the line at which time I spotted the AC Concierge and immediately questioned him about the process only to be told that they do have a dedicated line for premium passengers. At this point I was getting quite agitated and asked him why it was not in effect that day. To that he simply said he did not know. We then went into the priority boarding line which was a joke as there had to be 100 people in the line. Finally the agents announced start of boarding but instead called for those in zones 3 and 4 ahead of the priority passengers. At this point the boarding became a free for all and resembled those you would see in third world airports. On board the service was great but the hard product was showing its age. Food was quite tasty but they had no red wine as they simply had not loaded enough on the inbound trip from Montreal. IFE has a reasonable selection and before landing we were served another meal which was also very tasty.

Emirates,2.0,S Arjan,4th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Gatwick to Kolkata via Dubai, with a stopover of around 1 hr 30 mins in Dubai. Mobile boarding pass for both legs issued at the time of on line check in. Only reaching Gatwick at the time of depositing my check-in luggage I was told due to bad weather at Dubai, the incoming flight was delayed, consequently the flight from Gatwick will be delayed by 1 hour, meaning I will not be able to travel on my scheduled flight from Dubai to Kolkata - but have been rebooked on the next flight departing Dubai more than 12 hours later. There were at least 1 flight from Gatwick, and 2 flights from Heathrow that departed earlier than the 13:35 flight I was travelling, and if I was put on any of these flight I could have comfortably connected to my original DXB-Kolkata flight. Despite 1 hour delay in LGW-DXB flight, there was still 30 mins before my original DXB-CCU flight was due to depart, and I offered to travel on my original flight with my hand luggage only â€“ the checked in luggage can arrive in a later flight, and I can return to the Kolkata airport to collect my checked in luggage. I was only told everything is being done as per Airlines policies. (One of the ground staff started choreographing what fog looks like and why it is difficult for a pilot to fly through fog). Flight EK016 arrived in DXB around 1:25am, but I had to ask 4 different airline staff before gaining an understanding that I need to contact the transfer desk. It took me 17 mins in the queue at the transfer desk before I could reach the front, by which time the connecting Kolkata flight (departinf 02:00 hrs) was gone. I even proposed that I be allowed to travel to any other city e.g. Mumbai or Delhi, and be given a ticket on any domestic airlines from Mumbai/Delhi to Kolkata (or cash instead), but was told this was not possible. My only option is to travel by the later flight departing around 12 hrs later. So I had to hang around for the next 12 hours at the Dubai airport. My London to Gatwick flight was protected by EU Regulations, but the connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata was not, despite travelling on the same ticket so I could not claim compensation under EU Regulations. I understand the airlines has not anything legally wrong, but otherwise did not find any redeeming feature in Airlines handling of the issue, let alone appreciation of the inconvenience caused.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to CCU via DXB,November 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Emirates,2.0,Florian Roth,14th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who donÂ´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.",A380 / Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Hyderabad via Duabi,December 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,no

Air Canada,2.0,Tim Brust,30th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Charlotte. Flight was OK, but Air Canada's competence and caring stops there. I had a checked bag which they never sent to baggage claim. Since it was the last flight of the day (about 1 pm)--all Air Canada employees left the airport. I found that out after running from baggage carousel to baggage carousel and back and forth to the Air Canada desk and calling Air Canada customer service for two hours. They said they would contact the employees the next day and let me know what was up. Long story short--it took them 6 days to get my suitcase to me. I arrived on a Saturday but they didn't ship it out until Monday afternoon--and only because the flight was late and they were still there when the Fed Ex guy came. But it wasn't until Tuesday I knew it had beens ent--customer service knew nothing and I think just made things up. hey told me that the delivery guy didn't show up--and that the bag was going through a 48 hour security check--neither of which was true. And to top it all off--they didn't secure the shipping label properly--so the tag came off and was lost in transit. Did Air Canada customer service help? No--they had no tracking number--no information on the bag (which their website claimed was still missing) and no interest in contacting Fed Ex on my behalf. I had to track it down. I got my bag just in time to end my vacation and fly back home. I spent two to 3 hours everyday call Air Canada Charlotte, Air Canada customer service and Federal Express telling and retelling my story and tracking my bag down. Not a great vacation--and I had to wear the same couple of shirts and pairs of shorts I bought to tide me over for what I thought would be a couple of days without my clothes.

Alitalia,8.0,Matteo Tonelli,15th September 2015,We flew Alitalia from Chicago O'Hare to Pisa via Rome. Check-in was fast and boarding was quick as well. When we got on it was a pleasant feeling. The cabin had real Italian colors. The seats were a little narrow but not too bad. We had personal IFE which was great. We left on time and drinks and food came fast. The meal was good but too little. We had a nice sleep during the flight and arrived to Rome refreshed. The immigration was fast and the next leg was operated by Etihad Regional. They gave snacks and drinks for this short flight. Hopefully Alitalia will improve even more!,A330-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to PSA via FCO,September 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Filsone Tony,8th August 2014,United Airlines business or first class to Aruba is very bad. Misleading advertising service and claimed equipment is false. No inflight entertainment as advertised. No video or music in First Class. Seats tray and pockets all dirty with food and garbage from last passenger. This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it.

American Airlines,5.0,Catalin-Alexandru Epure,9th January 2016,"I booked flights with British Airways, and I was put on the way back from Orange County to London to travel with their partner, American airlines, via Dallas. The first segment was OK and landed in time in a new Boieng 737-800. There was WiFi on board, although very very expensive. The problems started in Dallas, where after boarding, we had to wait in an old Boeing 777-200 for 1.5 hours, for the luggage to be unloaded and redistributed so that the weight of the aircraft to be ideal. After take-off, the IFE started to work, but you couldn't just play the movie you wanted, you could either jump in the middle of it, or wait about 15 minutes until it will start again. As it wasn't enough, this system went out of power doing the middle of the movie, the crew had no idea and after 30 minutes it came back to life. Of course, I had to watch a movie 3 times from the beginning as you couldn't fast forward or anything. The food was generally bad, as was the wine they gave us. Just a small blanket and a pillow, no other things for the night. The crew didn't give much of an interest. I guess the old entertainment system was just because it was a night flight (scheduled departure 22:10) and not many people use it. That is why I rate it as an average experience.

Small aircraft not much of a problem as it was a short trip. It all started once we reached Chicago. After landing we waited in the aircraft for more than an hour. I reached my gate and asked the United staff about my plane. They clearly said that it was on time. So I go eat and come back and my flight is cancelled! I asked the same staff member again and she says I have to contact customer service. They tell me that there is another flight in 2 hours and they will transfer me. Told there are only middle seats in the middle row left! Th4 flight was delayed by an hour again and I was sure I would miss my connecting flight. Onboard the seat was very narrow no leg room and me being a vegetarian my special meal did not get transferred onto this flight. The staff were rude no smiles and hated being even asked for water. The entertainment was the worst I have seen! 4 channels 4 fixed movies one on each and they all start at the same time. Absolutely no value for money. As we finally after 8 hours land in London I had just 25 mins to go from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4 to catch my next flight so ran throughout no option and was one of the last people to catch the plane.

I scheduled this flight and called back 10 min later to see if I could catch a flight from the US to my connection but was told it would cost twice as much as the total of my trip, even though online I could verify it was cheaper and was offered a flight the next day which I would have to pay a ""difference in cost"" - which would also cost me more than the total of my current trip. I asked why I was not offered this flight when I had initially called and I was given the run around. If I cancelled my trip I would not get any money back and would only get a credit. I had also upgraded to premier class over the phone with one of their agents and was told I would be charged a total of $125 but my card was charged $215. When I complained to customer relations they denied it, stating they only show a charge of $125 and I would have to send in my bank statement. I sent in my bank statement and have not heard a word from them in almost 2 months.

In-flight refreshments were excellent, I was upgraded for the second flight so they were even better but even in economy there is a good selection of drinks. Staff are always friendly and efficient in my experience and these flights did not disappoint. My only suggestion would be that KLM/Air France follow the rest of the market and offer the Economy Plus ""comfort"" benefit to 1 passenger accompanying the Platinum cardholder, its really the only thing that I don't like about these airlines.

They were very rude and said I had to go to the Emirates connections counter. They informed me that there were 2 Emirates flights to Melbourne leaving an hour apart and I had gone to the wrong gate. I also discovered that Dubai airport had a new policy (6 months) of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. I said to the Emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to Melbourne so I wouldn't miss my flight. Another Emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to Melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. Emirates would not change my ticket as well as Qantas who sold the original ticket (Airline partnership situation) so I had to buy a new ticket for that leg Â£440. So in summary Emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 Emirates Melbourne flights leaving Dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers.

Air Canada,1.0,K Murtle,29th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Montreal to Vancouver. We arrived at the airport with lots of time to spare prior to our flight. One of the check in ladies helped us get our bags sorted and accepted. We paid to check our bags in for Vancouver on that flight checking in a small suitcase and a larger one. She printed us boarding passes and bag tags and explained that our seat allocations would be made at the gate. We arrived at the gate with lots of time to spare and waited. The staff there announced that they thought there was insufficient space on the plane to take all of the passengers carry on luggage and started to request that passengers voluntarily check their carry on luggage in. They also started to circulate around the passengers and tried to â€˜talkâ€™ anyone with largish carry on bags or multiple luggage items to check them in. They then announced that the flight seats had been oversold and that they wanted â€˜volunteersâ€™ to take a later flight. Then we were told that they would call out names for final seat allocations. I heard a name that started with the same letter as ours and approached the counter to personally enquire if it was in fact for our seat allocation. The Air Canada staff were all looking distressed and under pressure at this stage. I was told that it wasnâ€™t my name but the lady took our â€˜boarding passesâ€™ and said that our tickets were only standby tickets. I noticed that the copy which she kept, with no seat allocation printed on it actually had â€˜sbâ€™ in very small letters where the seat number would normally be printed which meant nothing to me up until that very moment. She said she would check and call out my name in due course with seat allocations. After another 10 or 15 minutes and a number of other customers being issued boarding passes, she called my name and started speaking. I explained I was an international traveller and had to get back to Vancouver on that flight. I told her I had bought and paid for my tickets weeks earlier and as far as I was concerned, I was contractually entitled to travel on that flight. We did get onto the flight, probably because I had been so insistent. When we arrived at Vancouver, after the 5 hour flight plus a lengthy wait at the carousel, our smaller case finally came onto the conveyor. I checked with the lost baggage staff, again having to wait for some time in a queue. They were good and advised that my other bag had been routed on a flight to Toronto and would arrive later that night. They would then deliver it to my Vancouver address the next morning. It arrived at about 1430 hours the next day and it looked as though it had been dragged through muddy water. It was filthy. And the luggage tag on it was tagged â€˜standbyâ€™ as well.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ayse Zarakol,2nd January 2016,"I've just had the worst experience of my traveling life, and it is not over. We (a couple and 5 year old) were due to fly out from Istanbul to London Gatwick on Wednesday with Turkish Airlines. Due to what would be a manageable snow storm elsewhere, we were first kept in the airport with a four hour delay. The area we were kept in was very crowded and not equipped to handle thousands of passengers they were bussing to the planes. Then we were kept in the plane for seven hours. Finally we were let off the plane. Once we got back to the airport we had to pass through customs and saw that they had made no allowances for the mess they themselves had created. Nobody seemed to know where we should go or what we should do. Then it was more waiting in various lines to get rebooked. Next day our flight was cancelled again. More lines and hours of waiting to rebook. Turkish Airlines has this ""amazing"" system where one cannot get rebooked at a check-in counter and instead has to go to a special desk called ""ticket sales"" to get rebooked. There are at most 10 of these desks throughout the airport, which were trying to process thousands of passengers yesterday. So after Turkish Airlines cancels your flight, they make you wait in line for hours for the privilege of getting rebooked. The fact that I am an Elite passenger (Star Alliance Gold) made no difference whatsoever. We are still stranded here - no seats available until Wednesday they say. And they make no compensation for hotels or food. Turkish Airlines should be ashamed of itself.

I was in premium economy and when you recline the seat back, the seat itself also moves forward. This initially seemed like a nice reclined position. However with no foot rest, this position created severe strain on my low back, and gave me a backache. I thought it was a fluke. However the same thing happened on the return flight.

American Airlines,3.0,Linh Bui,3rd September 2015,"I was flying out of Maui and it took several American Airlines agents to figure out how to issue the boarding passes for my family and check our luggage from Maui to Ottawa. We waited from 7.15pm until 8.50pm for them. We were originally scheduled to fly with United as part of a code share with Air Canada. At the airport, when we checked in with UA, they informed us of the changes and sent us to AA counter as our trip from Maui to Los Angeles was now with American Airlines. The agents sent us back to UA. The agent at UA was very helpful, printed the itinerary for us and told us that all the information was in order. In the end, the AA manager made some phone call to figure out how to issue our boarding pass and check in our luggage. They could have done that within the first 20 minutes instead of wasting our 1.5 hours in that hot airport. We did not receive any apology. When they issued our boarding passes, our family of four were split into 3 groups, when there were 3 empty rows (9 seats) at the back of the plane. When I walked to the back of the plane and asked the stewardess about putting me and my husband back there, they said no.

Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me.

But in this case, price and schedule left me no choice, so AA it was. While they continue to try to find ways to cram more people on their planes, and seating is definitely tight, in this case, since it was a red eye, I fortunately managed to sleep through the flight despite being not very comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived a little early and I mostly slept through it, so I guess that's a win! The A321 had inflight entertainment provided via ones own device and wifi. I did not attempt to use it. One thing about AA and MIA is there is a very long walk from the terminal to where the baggage claim is and it took maybe 15 more minutes after this walk before luggage arrived. In this case, the price of the flight was good, I got to my destination safely on time, and I slept through the flight.

We paid for our baby to have his own seat which the computer couldnâ€™t figure out. The airline doesnâ€™t employ enough staff to have anyone to help with the computer kiosks, so we had to wait in a long, slow line to speak to a person. 45 minutes later, we dealt with an agent who was extremely rude and unhelpful. She said it was too late to check bags, so my husband had to leave the airport with our checked bags while I did my best with a long security line. I asked if I could be moved through quicker. One agent said yes and another said no. I wasnâ€™t able to get rushed through, even though I informed security that I would likely miss my flight. I had to sprint through the airport to my gate with a crying baby, only to find that the gate had been closed. The attendant said she would â€œcheck to seeâ€ if we could still get on, but I saw her from the window chatting with other people while the plane started rolling away from the gate.

United Airlines,1.0,Mary Ann Jenkins,9th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Yesterday I traveled from Barcelona to Newark and was supposed to fly onto Austin. Once we landed in Newark, I saw that our Austin flight was cancelled. I am here to complain about the level of service that they gave to try to get rebooked. Once someone's flight is cancelled, there should be appropriate staff to handle the volume. Every representative was rude, as if it is my fault my flight was cancelled. We were all treated like a nuisance. After going through customs, I was halfway directed to the customer service line. It was downstairs, so I tried to use the escalator across the way to go down with my huge international bag. An agent screamed at us that we could use the escalator right in front of us, to not use that one and clog it up. Well we told her the escalator is broken and we can't use it. She didn't care. For some reason we could not use use the escalator that everyone else 50m away was using. I am 7 months pregnant and carried my huge bag down those stairs. I unfortunately pulled a muscle in my stomach, I should have used it anyway but I didn't. She still did not care. We then found the line. 100s of people were in it with two agents to help. We waited for over 4 hours. I got sick from not eating or drinking and being pregnant, but if I got out of line, I would have to start over. 30 minutes later the two agents tell us ""well we are off now, you guys have to call. Bye."" They left us. A man yelled ""I've been on hold with them for an hour and a half already!"" Most of us in tears from being there so long. I was there 4.5 hours, I don't know how long the people in the front were there. Unfortunately my phone was stolen in Spain, so I had no way to call. Simply stuck with no way to rebook.

American Airlines,5.0,B Merton,11th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | We were scheduled to fly from Miami to Orlando on May 6 2019, the flight was to depart at 3.30. Everything was fine we were just minutes from boarding, the previous flight had just deplaned and then a storm hit. The announcement was made that we were going to be delayed for an hour so we returned to the club. We arrived at the club and then received a text that the flight had been cancelled. We all have smart phones and can look at the radar and know that the storm had passed and the air had cleared up. I believe the flight was cancelled because of a mechanical issue and not weather related but to blame the weather keeps American from having to find hotel rooms for all the passengers effected. I went to the desk at the club to receive some help with getting us rebooked. The American airlines staff that I dealt with were less than professional or helpful. She actually told me to rent a car and drive to Orlando. (Well if I wanted to do that I wouldn't have contracted with American Airlines would I). She did get us on the stand by list for the 5:30pm flight. We arrived at the gate and were number 15 and 16 on the list, the gate agent was very nice and said he would do what he could to get us on the flight. The plane boarded and he called us to the gate and was able to get us on the plane. He said he couldn't get us in first class we were thankful to be on the flight. After a few minutes and first class being empty with the exception of a couple of seats our names were called and we were moved up to first class. American did finally rebook us for the next day on 2 different flights, we are just thankful we went stanby and were able to get home a bit late the same day.",Boeing 737-8,Couple Leisure,First Class,Miami to Orlando,2019-05-01 00:00:00,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,3.0,no

United Airlines,8.0,S Mead,6th July 2016,"Washington IAD to San Francisco and then 4 days later from San Francisco to Paris CDG with United. Both long flights, I was in economy, both times with priority boarding and in a window or aisle seat, which is important to me. I get priority with my Chase United credit card, I bought a package that included Premiere Access to check in with priority boarding for the flight to Paris, and I was glad I did, because I thereby avoided the mob of people at SFO waiting for access to the check in machines. Both of my seats were quite comfortable, I did not feel cramped. I am just under 6 feet tall and quite thin. I bought access to back of the seat entertainment on the IAD to SFO flight in advance at a slight discount, it was free on the Paris flight. I did not buy any food on the domestic US flight, but United has started handing out tiny little bags of savory snacks on their US flights, which is quite new. The food on the Paris flight was not a gourmet treat by any means, but it was OK. There was free wine or beer on that flight too, another new thing. Both of the flights departed and arrived on time, and delivered my luggage at my destination. Flight attendants were pleasant. So not a luxurious experience but an efficient one that did what I paid them to do. I think people tend to write reviews when they are infuriated by a terrible experience or delighted by a superlative one.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,D Schmeisser,25th September 2016,"Six segments with Delta Air Lines (one KLM codeshare in Europe), five were on time or early and the last was unavoidably delayed due to fog. Overall a good experience. I found the A330 business class seat to be extremely comfortable. Great for reading, screen time and for napping. AVOD was satisfying, movies included some classics, some new releases and a nice selection of non-US films with subtitles. Good mellow-music channel too. The ground and inflight staff were competent, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, which is my usual experience with Delta personnel. I am not a foodie, but I was not impressed with the catering. Perhaps too high expectations, given all the hype about celebrity chefs and the fancy menu. The first courses (starters, soups, salads) were great, the entrees were barely OK. Likewise the desserts.

The kids received toys from the stewardess (on both flights) and were happy the entire time. Connecting in Istanbul was OK, very crowded and gate logistics not very efficient, but understandable due to the small terminal from where we were shuttled to the plane with a bus. We did not check our bags and the staff were vocal on giving priority to overhead compartment for larger bags which suited us perfectly, this is something other airlines should think of.

Upgrading to Economy Comfort usually helps, in terms of better seat pitch, however for short-haul flights like AMS-TXL this is not a deal breaker anyway.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,M Hilton,26th January 2015,What can I say about long haul KLM? A true tale of extremes: Pros: Value for money (only Â£560 return ABZ-SIN via AMS). Lounge at AMS (free food drinks wifi and showers via Petroleum Card). Food and Beverage onboard was to a surprisingly good standard for economy airline food and freely available. Staff were attentive and helpful. Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world! IFE was so dated and a limited poor selection of music films and TV. Cabin decor is dull. All in all not too bad but the cons niggled away at me.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,5.0,yes

But Qatar Airways staff made it pretty stress free to accommodate us on the next flight which was luckily in 1 hour and which meant we would not miss the only Qatar Airways flight to Mumbai from Doha that day. Added bonus was we got to experience Qatar's A380 which would otherwise have been a B777-300 flight had we made our original connection.

United Airlines,1.0,Hendrix Andrew,11th January 2015,I used United in the past for domestic flights in the US and it was average I thought it would be fine to use them to travel abroad. Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price. Other airlines give full service for about the same price!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

As it was a late night departure I skipped dinner went to sleep right away. I got a good rest on the fully flat pods and woke up in time for breakfast. The service was good and the meal was of reasonable quality. Washrooms was another piece of proof of the aircraft's age but they were kept relatively clean.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,5.0,C Herviler,8th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Quito and Guayaquil to Amsterdam with KLM in economy. Check-in was fine on both flights. Very average service and aircraft. I don't like the narrow seats in the 3-4-3 configuration of the B777-200ER aircraft. Hot towels have disappeared which is a shame. Taste of the meals was okay but lukewarm. Toilets were clean and entertainment was good (not that many movies). Service was below average. Service button calls were often neglected by the crew. Once I asked for a snack/drinks in between meal services. Instead of bringing me a snack they requested me to go to the service galley in the back of the aircraft. On the way back to Amsterdam KLM ran out of meal choices (only one available instead of two). After flying numerous times with Singapore Airlines in the past years I notice a big difference in hard product and service between these two airlines.

Southwest Airlines,2.0,Sidyelyeva Galyna,24th February 2015,Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore.

Emirates,4.0,P Nunn,22nd May 2015,LGW-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. LGW-DXB B777. I had forgotten how bad the Emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one I used felt in need of a refit. The good selection of movies and TV can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets I gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no

First leg was very short so we didn't expect much as usual, however, the second leg was the longest we've felt on the plane. For an 11 hour long flight, we were served the first meal after 2 hours. I always order a special meal, but I regretted my choice as it was bland and tasteless. The second meal came an hour before landing and it was in a small box, not a full meal. For an 11 hour flight. They did serve drinks a couple of times in between the two meals, but we didn't want water the entire flight. The attitude of the crew was alright.

Lufthansa,7.0,Cheryl Lum,26th November 2018,"Not Verified | San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either",,,,,,,,,,,,
Air New Zealand,8.0,John Wood,18th November 2013,We flew NZ1 LHR-LAX and NZ2 LAX-LHR 777-300. Both flights were typical of ANZ quality and what we've come to expect over the years good food IFE and cabin crew. For the return trip we upgraded to exit row seats 34J & K and found them to be a good investment in terms of the extra cost althoughas others have commented it was a little chilly so use the blankets. Chatting with a member of the crew I was disappointed to learn that the new P.E. seats as fitted in the 777-300 are not to be used in the 787 aircraft because the company that makes them have made it uneconomical for ANZ. I think this is a shame having travelled in them before we found them far better than any other P.E. offering.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,10.0,J Katnic,16th December 2013,I had to make a last minute trip (same day round-trip) to SFO from LAX on 12/12/2013. I have not flown in economy in years except for Southwest but chose Delta as their price was much lower than Southwest (first class not worth it for this short of flight in my opinion): I booked this trip 10 days in advance. While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Benjamin Lawrence,18th December 2014,Flew NRT-DOH-JNB return. The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely. But would try to avoid the 787.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

American Airlines,9.0,D Graubard,6th February 2015,AA86 on Jan 22: ORD-LHR 767-300. Used Flagship Lounge before boarding - always great service there and one of the ladies always remembers me with a hello and chat. Boarding was quick - seat 6G and Business Class was full. Coach was around 70% full. Greeted by attendant on boarding and once at my seat attendant came and took my jacket and offered water/champagne/OJ. Took off on time and post-take off drinks were served with nuts. Dinner was halibut that was excellent and the F/A's were very attentive. Bose headsets always great and Samsung tablet had sufficient shows to watch. Slept 4 1/2 hours and asked for breakfast - was brought right away. Circled a couple times and landed at Terminal 3 - off the plane quickly and transferred to T5 for flight to Brussels.

United Airlines,1.0,Adrienne Holmes,24th March 2019,"Not Verified | This has been the worst experience ever! First our flight was delayed which couldâ€™ve been ok however when we landed in Houston we literally had 45 minutes to catch our flight. After going through customs then getting in a line one of the reps told us to get out of line to get in another, once in that line the rep there told us we were suppose to stay in the line we just got out of. Once weâ€™ve made it to our gate which was C40 we were told that they already booked us for another flight even though our flight havenâ€™t left yet. So we had to speed walk all the way back to the other end of the airport to gate E. Iâ€™m typing this as I am walking to the gate, hopefully we wonâ€™t miss this one.

While AZ and VA were wonderful friendly flight attendants decent food (even the stuff for purchase was good) modern planes flights all on time the United flights in contrast felt like traveling in Russia in he 80s. The FAs were angry at everybody and it seems passengers just disturb their peace and are just a huge inconvenience in general. The planes are filthy and old. All my United flights were delayed between 30-60 min and the complete lack of communication in the gate was disturbing. Gate agents were equally grumpy.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

The tickets are much more expensive than their competitors (Southwest, etc) and there is less room for seating and less room for carry-ons to be stowed above. The overhead storage space is so limited that I had to check a carry-on I brought, which may cause fragile items to be damaged. When asked about why I would have to check this, the female attendant spoke with an extremely annoyed and sarcastic tone telling me â€œwell thatâ€™s too bad, you can take a seat and book another flightâ€. This is awful practice, and is a mystery to me why a person like this is getting paid to represent a company. I will never fly with American Airlines again, and I suggest anyone considering flying with them abandon that idea.

In the airport we were faced with a huge line to check in and it was moving incredibly slow. We only had to check in our baggage as we had already checked in in the system. There was no baggage-drop line. After we had queued for more than an hour and we finally reached the counter, the staffer demonstrated the worst service I've ever experienced. It turned out that our two suitcases each exceeded the permitted weight limit on 23 kg with 200 grams. It is normally not a problem, as I in two seconds relocate some of the content from my check-in suitcase to my hand baggage but they refused to let us do so, unless we went to the very back of the line. This would mean that we would miss our flight. Instead we had to pay MXN 1800 each (ie in total MXN 3200) for the overweight. It is a significant off-market and burdensome condition not to be allowed to repack the suitcases in order to comply with the allowed weight limit.

On the return trip home, I was on time, but their plane was not. By the time I arrived (once again in Atlanta) there were only seven minutes to catch a connecting flight. I sprinted through the airport to arrive 3 minutes short. The answer from the sarcastic Delta representative - they may be able to place me on standby for a flight leaving in a few hours, but I should probably start checking out hotels. Nice! I am disappointed with their poor logistical planning and lack of professionalism. To top matters off, my suitcase was damaged.

Aeromexico,7.0,G Castillo,20th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Before taking this trip, I read so many horrible reviews of Aeromexico. We flew from Toronto to Guatemala City, with a layover in Mexico City. One thing I will say is that these flights never leave on time. I think every single one of our flights were late. But, we still managed to arrive at our destinations within 10-20 minutes of the original arrival time (sometimes earlier). Though, I think it would be ideal to keep in mind that if you have to make a layover, try and plan for at least a 1-2 hour layover. This will give you some wiggle room with an airline that is notorious for delays and save you the headache and stress. The food was mediocre, but I find most airplane food is. I have flown several times internationally to Asia, and have never liked the food. On our flights it was a croissant sandwich and a snack - standard and nothing wrong with it. I didn't have any negative experiences with the flight attendants on these flights. No one was rude or unhelpful. Seats were as comfortable as I expected them to be. A few of our flight segments were overbooked, which seems to be general practice for most airlines, which is what seemed to lead to the delays we were experiencing.

Asked to go to the transit desk found more than 500 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood for 4.5 hours with no refreshments. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At 10.30 am staff started directing passengers to different gates depending on their destination. We sat until 5.30 pm with no information as to which flight we were likely to catch. Although they handed out food vouchers at 2.30pm they ran out so not everyone got vouchers. At 5.30pm we were finally given boarding cards for the 9.45 pm connecting flight to Trivandrum. Although we waited 16 hours in the airport Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. Finally arrived at our destination at 3.45 am on 24th Feb.

United Airlines,1.0,Lyndsi Weiss,16th November 2016,"United Airlines from Albany with a connecting flight in Newark to Montego Bay in Jamaica. We got to the airport early, boarded our plane on time (United Express Plane), first flight of the morning, and had to deplane due to a hydraulic pump failure. So all 11 of us went back into the airport and we're told it was a quick fix. About a half hour later we got back on the same plane, took off and we were in the air for 10 minutes, and then told we had to go back to Albany due to the same pump failing again. Why was this not tested in the morning before the first flight goes out? Why would we get back on the same plane with mechanical issues? So after getting off the plane for a second time we went back to speak with the gate staff who were less than helpful. None of them knew what was going on, no updates were provide and none of them spoke English clearly. We ended up mapping our own way from Albany to Philadelphia, Philadelphia to Miami, spending the night in Miami, and getting to Jamaica the next day by noon. All of these inconveniences will be paid for by United, and they even sent us each $50 vouchers, which we will not be using because we plan to never fly with United again. The story doesn't end here, our flight from Jamaica to Newark boarded late, no big deal we got there. As soon as we landed we were notified that our final flight from Newark to Albany had been delayed over 2 hours with no explanation. So, we sat in the airport for another 5 hours, not receiving updates as the gate staff still did not speak English, and were sarcastic and rude, as if our questions were stupid. Finally we boarded the express plane (that smelled like it had never been cleaned before) at 10:30, just making it out of Newark for the night and landed in Albany a little before midnight. We lost a day and a half of our vacation, spent hundreds of extra unplanned dollars and even considered just going home all because of United Airlines. We will not be using our vouchers they gave us because we will not be flying with them ever again. We will be flying with Southwest from now on like we used to.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Tom Payne,22nd November 2015,"Chicago to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. This was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance. I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people. I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers. I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul. But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it. The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will. It is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service.",,Business,Business Class,ORD to DUS via IST,November 2015,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

Lufthansa,8.0,Hannes Schauer,1st May 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Singapore. Check-In Took place in NUE very quick and efficient. Ground Staff with no smile but not rude or unfriendly. Flight Departure in NUE was 30 minutes late due to weather. Communication by the crew was ok. The flight only was 25 minutes and no service at all. Frankfurt to Singapore is an A380 flight. Boarding was very quick. We had seats in the upper deck Economy cabin. This is compared to the usual Economy Cabin very nice. The seats are 2-4-2. And the cabin is very calm with only 70 Pax or so. There is 1 responsible FA for the cabin. At this flight it was a very gentle and friendly staff who took care of passenger and had a very great attention. The dinner was very delicious and several drink services before and after the food was served. Before our landing in SIN they serve typical Economy breakfast. Since the arrival in SIN is 5pm local time I canâ€™t really understand why they not serve just an quick snack instead of a breakfast. The entertainment program of LH is good. A big advantage of the A380 are the camera views of the aircraft. Due to the great FA on this trip we have been really exited about LH.,ERJ 190 / A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,March 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Air New Zealand,6.0,M Pearce,6th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Perth to Wellington via Auckland, premium economy to Auckland, economy to Wellington leaving Perth on Feb 1st. Perth-Auckland sector on leased EVA Air 777 due to unscheduled engine maintenance and 787â€™s. Seat comfortable and premium economy pretty empty. Stuck on the ground in Perth due to plane having no satellite connection to Auckland so having to get new flight path sent manually to Perth airport, printed and brought onto plane. Approx 90 minutes stuck on ground waiting for this. Cabin staff pretty old and not particularly friendly, wasnâ€™t offered a water during the delay. Flight itself was fine, dinner was delicious. Despite pretty empty premium economy call bell not answered 90% of the time, I know itâ€™s not business class but would have expected better service, maybe they knew I was only there through an accepted upgrade bid. Cabin crew generally pretty quite passive aggressive, didnâ€™t seem to enjoy their job anymore. Maybe time to move on. Arrived in Auckland with 35 minutes before my flight to Wellington departed, on mentioning this to purser got a curt response that there would be another flight in an hour anyway so what was the big deal. Ground staff in Auckland refreshingly friendly and helpful on putting me on next flight to Wellington. This short flight was pretty unremarkable, no complaints with it. Overall a comfortable journey but attitude of staff on Perth to Auckland very unsatisfactory.","Boeing 777-300, Boeing 737",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Perth to Wellington via Auckland,February 2019,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no

My daughter and I moved to empty seats opposite each other, the stewardess asked and said we had to pay more for those empty seats and made us move back (even tho a minute earlier I watched the gate agent give a free upgrade to a gal boarding). The stewardess was unpleasant, not only ordered us back to our assigned seats but also made several others move, even just across the aisle. What was also interesting is I asked her name and she pulled her smock/jacket over where I could see her badge, reached down and tucked the badge completely out of reach. I moved one seat back so my daughter and I could each have separate rows and she made me move back â€œsomeone is sitting in that seatâ€ which of course was a lie as no one boarded.

The positives are a great entertainment system, good prices if the flight is booked at the right time but that's about it. Nowadays the meals have been scaled down and they must be using a cheap supplier as they have gone downhill on the culinary front - none of the meals that I have had over the past couple of years have been very nice, especially when you compare the economy cabin food of Singapore and Malaysia Airlines both of whom were excellent. I also find that it depends on the crew if you get attention on your flight - on this flight both legs the crews were not at all interested in the passengers, no water runs were made, you had to ring continuously for drinks and then you were served by a surly crew.",A380 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to BHX via DXB,September 2015,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,D Grewton,20th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Most recently I was flying from Rome to Kansas City, via Turkish Airlines and United. Connecting through Chicago, my flights switched to United from Turkish Airlines. Turkish Airlines was able to ensure my bags made it from Rome to Istanbul to Chicago all in one piece despite multiple delays and a very long layover. United lost my bag in the 1 hours flight from Chicago to Kansas City. At the baggage claim the gentlemen said it was still in Chicago and would be delivered the next day. It was not. Unfortunately, they were still unable to recover my luggage as of 3 days after landing, forcing me essentially try to make excuses for not having the promised items at the meeting with my clients. I filed additional claims for my luggage twice, neither of which were even responded to. 4 days later, I called again, and was told my luggage was simply lost. I unchecked rechecked the bag in Chicago after arriving from an international flight, and they somehow lost the bag. Trying to get United to cover the costs of what was lost is proving to be even more nightmarish. The quality of service is astounding awful. I have had delayed bags before with United, but now having them simply lose my bag on such a short flight, and then fight me at every step when trying to claim the bag is shockingly despicable. If I would have known my Turkish Airlines flight was using United for the last leg, I would have never bought the ticket, as United is generally a terrible airline anyways for constant delays, uncomfortable seats, and delaying my baggage constantly. But this has trumped all other experiences regarding terrible care and costing me literal thousands of dollars for their negligence.",,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Kansas City,2017-05-01 00:00:00,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,7.0,D Bracegirdle,29th September 2015,"In general Air Canada do a good job with their transatlantic flights and represent pretty good value for money (currently undercutting Air Transat on many flights). The planes offer standard legroom, a good level of cleanliness, attentive service and a really good infotainment system. They seem to have a consistent problem in my experience of boarding in a timely manner (nearly all my flights have left a little late). The food is generally good, and the drink service on my last flight was regular, generous and friendly. The downsides - the last 2 times I have flown with them they messed up my meal orders. The time before last they did not have a gluten free option as I had requested. The last time they gave me a gluten free meal with chicken in it. I am a fusspot gluten free/veggie (which had been noted on the agent website's booking form), luckily my wife had the vegetarian meal which happened to be gluten free. Their official response - they can only cater for one dietary requirement. Sad to see this in the 21st century, so if you don't fit into a particular box, bring your own food along to avoid disappointment. Fair do's to Air Canada though, they do keep offering money off when they mess up, but I would prefer a meal I can eat with no fuss or bother. My only other minor dislike is having the headphone socket on the armrest of the seat where it is really easy to knock it out or damage the socket.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to London,July 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,6.0,John Doig,22nd June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Toronto. I had not flown before in the new Premium Economy of Air Canada, although I had done so on several occasions with AC Rouge leisure subsidiary including on this route, before it was â€˜transferredâ€™ back to main-line AC. Check-in at DUB was problem free and expeditious as PE passengers can use the Premium lines. When this service was operated by AC Rouge PE passengers were directed to use DUB Fast Track security. This perk not offered on main-line AC. Boarding was as expected, PE being the second group to board after Business class. The flight appeared full, all seats were occupied in the PE section. The seats were a little more comfortable than those on Premium Rouge with perhaps a little more leg room. As this service departed DUB early afternoon, lunch was serviced not long after departure. There were 2 choices for the main course and the meal was serviced on china ware. No so the drinks with plastic glasses, (apart form a wine glass on the meal tray!) and coffee/tea from paper cups. This is a downgrade from Rouge PE where real glasses and china mugs for coffee/tea are used. The second meal or snack was exactly the same as offered in Premium Rouge. A significant difference was the lack of a dedicated FA to PE. FAs in PE are shared with Economy, with Economy being a much larger cabin, at times there was no FA to be seen in PE. With Rouge PE there is dedicated FA at all times. Another difference is that the FAs on main-line are more mature, and for the most part more experienced. The flight arrived on time and dis-embarkation was as expected, PE exited followed Business class passengers. Based this experience, I found the AC PE service inferior to that of the nearest comparison, international Premium Rouge.",A330,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,DUB to YYZ,2018-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes

Air Canada,7.0,C Kim,23rd March 2015,Just flew from Seoul to Vancouver and then onwards to Los Angeles less than 24 hours ago. Flight was fine except that I'm not too sure if the four star rating is justified - I'd say its more like 3.5. Tried the 787 for the first time and I have to say that the lighting system is brilliant as it eases the level of brightness on the eyes whenever the light is turned on by going from dark to bright gradually. Another added bonus to flying with Air Canada is that it makes US entry easy since customs and immigration is cleared in Canada thus not having to deal with the debacle that is met at US airports. As for the in flight experience the food wasn't half bad but the seating and entertainment can see some improvements. The seats were not ergonomically designed and no matter what position I would turn my body I just couldn't manage to sleep due to the discomfort and entertainment although extensive did not have a decent selection of films to choose from.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,yes

The flight itself was fine - not notably good or bad compared to many other airlines I have been on. My bag was delayed on the connection which was annoying but acceptable for a day, but less ideal when it became a second day with no explanation or contact from Turkish Airlines. But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again.

Aegean Airlines,4.0,Dimitrios Zikos,14th January 2010,I have travelled many times with Aegean Airlines from Berlin to Athens Athens to Larnaca but also in domestic flights in Greece. In general I would say that it is a very good company as long as everything goes well and you DONT need anything from the customer support. In that case you have to wait for hours (sometimes days) for someone to pick up the phone quite often to tell you that she/he is not competent to respond to your question and as such your call will be forwarded. Surprisingly 9 out of 10 times nobody will pick up the forwarded call. Another malicious trick they are doing is saying that you should wait for the responsible person to call you. Something that may happen after a week or so if you get lucky. They also have the bad habit of not informing the passengers for delays or other unexpected event that may jeopardise the trip. I missed a flight once (one of the very few that departed that day) because the advice of the Athens airport information desk (Aegean did not pick up the phone or the line was busy from 9 in the morning till midnight) to to my question if the flight will be delayed-cancelled or not was to go at the airport four o'clock in the morning and hope that the flight will take place otherwise ask the Aegean people there. I didn't risk it. As a result I was waiting 4 months to get the taxes from the ticket back. There are also hidden charges as using the internet to book tickets involves a fee the same applies though if you book the tickets by phone.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,yes

Service on the plane was below any standard. Lady who was serving us obviously had a bad day and she was extremely rude. She was shouting at people. not enough food so never got what I wanted to.

American Airlines,2.0,Lydia Bowman,16th October 2016,"Norfolk to Orlando. My husband and I booked American through Cheap Flights.com and I have never regretted a reservation like I have this one. First, on our flight to Florida, we had to cancel and rebook our flight on the day of FIVE times. We were never notified that our original flight was cancelled, and even once we signed up for alerts, no one ever called me to rebook flights. We finally got a flight out as we were dropping off friends at the airport and checked with the American ticketer, for a flight an hour from that time. Thankfully, our family was able to bring our packed luggage but we had to undo cancellations for our hotel, find a completely different car rental, and did not arrive in Florida until 1 AM. That, however, pales in comparison to today. We got up at 3 for our 5.15 flight, only to find at the airport that flight had been ""cancelled"" and we were moved to a 6.35 flight, with unassigned seats and are currently waiting assignment. This is so unacceptable and unprofessional, I am at a loss for words. The individuals who work here are wonderful, but the company is terrible.

American Airlines,1.0,Chris Bland,13th November 2015,"Dallas to Quito via Miami. What was supposed to be a routine departure from Dallas at 5am with an arrival at Quito at 2pm (via quick stopover in Miami) turned into a 24 hour shocking debacle all due to the unprofessional couldn't give a hoot attitude of ground staff. We cleared security at 4.15 and checked on the board that we were still for Gate C22 . The board confirmed Gate C22 and we proceeded directly there. At 4.40 an announcement was made that the gate had changed to A39 - two terminals away. By the time we got there (with quite a few others) they had closed the boarding! They blamed it on us for not checking the board 60 minutes before departure. On telling them we checked 45 minutes before departure they said they had no control over the board and that we should have googled ""something"" to check on the Gate! Her attitude was belligerent, demeaning and in my opinion she should not have that job. We were put on a later flight that missed our connection. On arrival in Miami, we asked for hotel accommodation, or at least meal/beverage tickets for our 8 hour delay but were told they only did that for ""mechanical "" delays and not for people that missed their flights, again putting the blame on us. The attitude and belligerence of this staff member was on a par with her Dallas counterpart. She told us our baggage had proceeded on the flight we missed - so much for security - and she promised it would be on our flight to Quito that evening. I did not trust her advice and later asked another staff member. He said they could not tell where the baggage was but that it would be on our evening flight (so one of them was lying). Anyway, we finally got to Quito to spend another 90 minutes waiting and then complaining that our luggage had not arrived. The queue at the lost baggage desk was unbelievable ~ all with similar stories. They promised we would get the luggage today - but it is still in Miami!

When we first boarded, the pilot was standing in the aisle and introduced himself to my son. We told them it was our very first flight ever and he could see that my son was in tears. After introducing himself he told my son that he will safely get us there and will make sure itâ€™s a wonderful flight so he will love flying, so do not worry about a thing, and even showed my son the cockpit area, it made his day, week, year. They also gave him a little airplane sticker pin. We hit a little bit of turbulence on the way however the pilot told us every single time prior to possibly hitting it and even explained why and that it was perfectly safe and how long the turbulence might last. It made us all so comfortable. I have flown at least 20 flights just since then and have yet to have a bad experience with Southwest.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Melih Yaramanoglu,31st October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Washington. Turkish Airlines is still good. The catering on board is suffering from bean counter recommendations. Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly. One crew member kept bringing me tea (without my asking) while I worked for about six hours. She always had a pleasant smile throughout the trip.

Was at the airport (Dubai) 3 hours early. No problem going through security. I will just skip to the problem. Poor communication. We were delayed 7 hours yes 7 hours and no one to tell us anything. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before we were told the plane was being taken out of service. Sat at the gate for another 3 hours and still no word. We finally heard from passengers that had been inquiring that we needed to be at gate B32 from B18 and the plane will depart in an hour. Really. No one from the airlines said a word.

All our flights were on time and our connections were made which was good but I felt the service was just lacking, especially when compared to other international carriers.

Both flights 80-90% full on economy. They charge for checked luggage, but they do allow check in hand luggage, so that the cabin does not become too cramped, which we did. Food was more than satisfactory - on the return flight I had requested a seafood meal which was superb (in combination with a very nice local white wine).

The video screen is now High Definition and is like using a smartphone app. One thing you do immediately notice in the cabin is the size of the windows the cabin had a nice open feeling and the dimming feature meant that you could set the lighting to almost any setting that was comfortable.

The advantages are only more space and more attention from the cabin crews on what you need during the flight (such as more foods/beverages, add blanket). The meal was OK. I had pre-ordered a meal, but the cabin crew did not notice it. Thus I had to ask and wait my meal. The seat was good and comfortable. I could recline it much more to the back. For the value of money, upgarde to premium economy for long route (more than 10 hours flight) is worth. The flight entertainment was not spectacular and contains old movies.

I proceeded to call there 800 number as they instructed to find other arrangements. The agent sent me to Daytona Beach which is an hour and 30 mins away from Melbourne. I drove to the airport only to find out that the agent had booked me on a flight out of Dayton OH. Due to her lack of incompetence, I had driven to an airport that wasn't even flying to my destination. How do you make that mistake knowing I live in Fl and booked me a flight from OH. I called the 800 number again as Delta had a flight leaving from Daytona Beach to Atlanta and they could get me as close as Boston which my destination was Portland ME. Delta suggested that I contact AA and have them transfer my ticket to them. When I got a live agent on the phone they unfortunately could not do that for me as they were not transfering any flights for customers to other airlines. I had to end up paying for another ticket through Delta because of AA incompetents. I am thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied with how AA handled the situation. They only refunded me for the cancelled flight I originally bought from them and would not refund me for the inconvenience they caused me nor would they give me miles for there agents mistake. They told me that they are not responsible for me making the option of flying and buying another ticket through another airline. That they can only address to higher management about the agent that made the error. I will never fly with AA again.

Emirates,2.0,W Doralt,11th May 2014,We were disappointed by the standard of the flight from Male to Dubai. The plane was old old entertainment system (not very responsive and outdated quality also the Arabic subtitles in large size could not be switched off) and all interior a bit worn off. One would not expect it with this airline. Food was mediocre at best and the preferred choice was gone before our row was served. Drinks (non alcoholic and alcoholic) were all fine though. Toilets: Two toilets out of soap relatively soon after the start of the flight. Not great also in terms of cleanliness. Floor: Worn off but mainly disturbing because staff did not collect / pic up plastic debris fallen on the floor during the flight. Main ground for disappointment was the broken tray (46G) preventing you from eating (nothing could be put on the tray without falling / sliding off). Staff apologised but in the end though they were friendly that does not take away the inconvenience and as the flight was full (at least in econ.) a change of seat was no option.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Time for the connection was 1 hour 20 minutes. Unfortunately TK0051 departed delayed and landed more than 1 hour later than the previously scheduled arrival time. The TK0051 flight landed in Istanbul at about 19.10 h when the scheduled landing time was 18.00 h. Although I rushed to the gate where I arrived at 19.26 it was impossible for me to get the connecting flight which departed at 19.20 sharp. There were at least 6 more passengers in my same situation. Nobody was waiting for us at Istanbul airport to give us assistance no help was offered. We went to the ""customer care counter"" where a Turkish airlines worker simply gave us instructions to go to the transfer desk. After a very long queue a Turkish Airlines employee explained to us that there was no available flight to Madrid that day. We had to get flight TK1857 departing at 7.50 am next day. Turkish Airlines would provide us with a hotel dinner and breakfast.

American Airlines,3.0,Gloria Morales,4th January 2016,"On December 27th, my husband and I had tickets to fly out of Newark airport into Charlotte, then San Juan PR. When we arrived at the airport there was confusion amongst everyone. We waited for what seemed to be over 2 hours to see an agent. The agents left the economy class to serve priority customers. All three agents served priority. No one was at the counter for economy class. Several customers and I tried to speak with the supervisor, but she refused to speak to us. One gentleman was nice enough to take care of us. We found out that our flight was cancelled. My husband and I had to return home, which cost us $55.00, then catch the next available flight the next evening leaving JFK. This cost us another 65.00. We arrived San Juan at 2am on the 29th. We lost 1 full day, plus one night of our vacation time. On Jan 2, we were assigned to return home. We had two carry on bags because we were not planning on taking the connecting flight. When we were on line to aboard the plane, the young girl said, you will have to check your bags, with no explanation. I said, we can't because we are not taking the connecting flight. She never looked at me. She just repeated, ""you Have to check your bags, you will get them at the gate on the other side!"" When we went onboard there were many empty bins. I asked the steward, why did the young girl at the gate make us check our bags if there are several empty bins. He apologized and said, she should have checked with us first. I have to say I didn't feel safe or supported with most of the staff working for American Airlines. My husband and I felt we were treated very poorly. We've been traveling regularly.

Qatar Airways,6.0,J Clifford,23rd December 2013,Have just completed 2 very much anticipated legs with Qatar Airways Paris to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. We were so disappointed which is hardly what I expected to be saying here Used Air France La Premiere lounge in Paris although nice had limited food offerings but comfortable. Boarding welcome and crew great but meal uninteresting and veal tough. Only served with rice. It did do the trick though as required no dessert. Cabin was not cleaned prior to landing. Our arrival in Doha was delayed which meant the long anticipated use of the Premium Lounge was not met as by the time we were bussed to terminal we were told we had to board in 10 minutes. No seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. Back on the bus and our flight to Melbourne. Greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. For first time Qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. When food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at Doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. Very little cabin presence throughout flight. Pyjamas offered and most passenger used them but only saw one bed made up by crew.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Amnon Freund,5th October 2015,"We flew Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt with a layover in Istanbul. First the service on the flight was terrible, I accidentally spilled hot coffee on my wife, the stewardess noticed it but couldnt care less (although it was burning hot, and my wife yelled), when I asked her for a napkin to clean the spilled coffee, she handed me 1 napkin without even asking if there is anything else she could do to help. That was only the beginning, due to late departure from Tel Aviv, we arrived late to Istnbul just to see our connecting flight push out of the gate (15 minutes earlier to take off time), we went to the Turkish Airlines desk, who told us we need to go to the transfer desk. When we got to the transfer desk, the clerk told us that we have been rebooked to a flight at 04:10, which meat that we had 9 hours wait. when I asked if they will give us a hotel room till the flight, we were informed that only if the delay is over 10 hours do they supply a hotel room. I asked to speak to a manager on duty to explain that the wait is 9 hours at night, we went to speak to a staff member but after letting us wait for 10 minutes he informed us that he is not a manager, and if we want to speak to one we need to go through immigration to the Turkish Airlines desk they will help us. We did so only to realize that there was nothing there. We needed to go back through immigration and went again to the desk to try to understand what we are expected to do in the 9 hours wait. The clerk informed us that we will be able to go to the Millennium lounge but only from 22:00 and until then we can get a complimentary meal from any restaurant in the terminal - which turned out to be false, only Burger king accepted the voucher for a lousy restricted basic meal. I can understand delays and re-booking, but I expect the airline will take responsibility for the delay and supply passengers a reasonable solution for their malfunction.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,TLV to FRA via IST,September 2015,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2.0,no

We booked our flights with American Airlines and the flight was operated by Iberia. The experience was terrible with both companies was terrible. On the flight over our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Madrid, we were put on an extra flight that took us to Santiago and then to Palma, Mallorca. We arrived to Mallorca 12 hours delayed - that was out of the airlines control. When we went to check in for our flight back home we were told that none of us (5 passengers) were on the flight list! We stood at the check in counter for an hour and a half while the costumer service agent tried to fix the problem and give us a new booking. Apparently while our flight over was altered due to the delay and missed connection someone deleted us from the flight list on our return flights, so that we appeared on the flight list but could not have boarding passes printed. The agent was able to fix all of our flights but one, she could not figure out how to reissue the ticket for my cousin from Madrid to New York so we had to leave him behind at the airport in Madrid. Iberia staff members including supervisors told us that their ability to fix this issue was limited because it was technically an American Airlines booking, however they could not get a representative from American Airlines to be of assistance (and neither could I on my 3 international phone calls for over an hour to America Airlines) Technically my cousins ticket was canceled so all that he could do was go and buy a ticket for the following day",,,,,,,,,,,,

After security we went to our original gate, where we realized it was changed to 11. When we arrived at our new gate boarding already began. As we were walking in, my wife made a humorous comment about the gate change. It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in, ""you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes"". Upon boarding, we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken. We had paid extra money to receive the ""extra legroom seats"" and we were seated in row 1. It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments. I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags, this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight. It was here where one of the flight attendants came up to me and said ""sir you cannot have your bags in front of you"". I kindly told her that there was no space in any compartments near me, she said you need to go to the back of the plane and ""find space"". Have paid extra for the ""even more space"" seat and paying to sit in row 1, I was flabbergasted when we asked the flight attendant for a blanket for my pregnant wife and she responded with ""that's $5 dollars, how will you pay?"". It was about 30 minutes into the flight when the flight attendant came through with water and asked what drinks we would like. I requested for a Ginger ale and the flight attendant wrote it down. It was 42 minutes to be exact before I received my wife's drink. I asked the flight attendant twice about the drink.

United Airlines,1.0,Michael Rooney,8th October 2014,Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done.

They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Natalie Potter,4th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I took a returning flight from SJO to FLL yesterday with my 68yr old father who has Parkinson's. When I got off the plane there was no assistance. It was a complete disaster trying to get through baggage, declorations, and customs. I booked my flight to SJO with Spirit Air, who clearly at booking gives option for Wheelchair Assistance. Everything on the Spirit flight went smoothly. Not the case at all with Southwest. It couldn't have gone any worse. When I contacted Southwest customer service, I was completely dismissed and was told it was the airports problem. I was also told I should have not used the app and booked online so I could drop down a box some place and choose Wheelchair assistance. Doesn't sound so handicap friendly. Regardless I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight so I could get this handled and was left on my own with my father who can walk far with consistent tremors and dementia.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,Lubov Rom,19th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Paris via Seattle with Delta Air Lines. Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more. Obviously there's no respect for customers. Flying with low cost companies is better than Delta!","Boeing 777, A320",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Tel Aviv via Seattle / Paris,April 2018,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,no

A journey I upgraded from economy to business first using a global premier upgrade a free perk obtained as a IK level frequent flyer. I feel that the level of service on United has improved drastically and the efforts of front line personnel should be recognised. The flight attendants on UA5 from Heathrow to Houston were superb. They provided very professional prompt and friendly service. A comfortable seat in a new Boeing 787. In fact throughout all including my return journey from Rio via Houston and Chicago all check in and flight personnel were considerate and attentive. All flights arrived on schedule or early. I would also add that as a United flyer since 1995 my baggage has never been lost! From what I can see the only service problems this company ever had are being corrected.

During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention.

American Airlines,1.0,Christophe Vacher,24th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I had enough with American Airlines. It's now #2 on the list of worst airlines I ever used (#1 is Wamos, a Spanish airline). Their personnel on the ground (and in the air) is actually pretty helpful and their machines fairly simple to use, at least from my experience. But it's once you're onboard that you realize your mistake. I paid $1030 for a flight from LA to Reading and back, the same price I would pay for a trip to Europe, which is twice the distance. You'd think for that price you can get a minimum quality, even on economy. Wrong. For a start, you pay $30 for your first check-in luggage, and it grows exponentially! Totally outrageous. What this does, it makes everybody bringing carry-ons, overcharging the cabin with carry-on luggage, making it hard to find space above your seat for your luggage, so you have to put it in a totally different area (what a hassle to get it when you exit the plane!). No food for the whole flight (Yes, AA, I don't call food a couple of pretzels and a soda). If you want food, you have to pay for it. And what kind of food! Then, there is the entertainment: just as it seems to become a trend on the worst airlines, American Airlines forces you to use your own devices to be able to watch their programs. In their penny pinching minds, they automatically assume that everyone has a smart phone, or a tablet, or a computer. If you don't have any device on you, or your device is not compatible with their system (more on that later), you're out of luck. But the incredible part is, they don't even provide any electric plug or USB for you to plug in your devices! So, if all you have to watch movies onboard is your smartphone (which is already pitiful), and you need your phone battery fully charged for when you arrive at your final destination and need to call your friends, taxis, hotels, etc., again, you're out of luck. Now, let's talk about device compatibility with their onboard movie/TV system, which uses Flash Player. I did have a fully updated version of Flash Player on my computer, but their system kept saying it was not updated. After several attempts, since they were offering to download their own updated version of Flash Player, I decided to uninstall my version and replace it with theirs. Guess what? It still would not work. Their system would not recognize its own version of Flash Player on my machine! Unbelievable. I uninstalled and re-installed the app again, tried everything to get it to connect. Nothing worked. I spent the whole trip with no entertainment. Also, the cabin remained pitch black the whole time (you could barely see where you walked) which was very hard on your eyes when people constantly turned on their individual light or their computer screen. When we got to the luggage claim area at the airport, no indication anywhere of which carousel it was. When we finally found it, the previous plane had not even started their download, which made us wait for an extra hour. To top it off, I was carrying fragile items in a separate box. American Airlines made me pay an extra $200 (one way) because it was oversize. But the best part: they didn't put it with the oversize luggage (that are usually handled with a bit more care), they put it with the regular ones. Nothing was broken, but the whole experience really made me furious. The irony in all this is: AA is one of the only airline companies to wear the name: American. Aren't you ashamed, guys? You should be.",,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Los Angeles,October 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,1.0,K Kaycie,20th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I will never fly with American Airlines again. I just got back from my annual vacation (Roanoke to Portland) to visit family on the west coast. I have used American Airlines twice now to take this trip, and they completely ruined my vacation both times. Last year, my flight was delayed twice leaving my first airport. This caused me to miss my connecting flight. Then they re-routed me, which added an additional stop, after hours of dealing with rescheduling flights, I got on my flight from Dallas to Portland. Sat on the tarmac for 3 hours then that flight was cancelled. Then I had to wait in line for hours to reschedule yet again. I lost a day and a half of my vacation because of the delays. This year (last week) I was scheduled to fly out at 5:50pm. got to the airport to check in, and my flight had been canceled due to the AC on the plane being broken - they couldn't schedule me for another flight out until the next morning. Also, rescheduling resulted in adding an additional stop to my trip. I missed an entire day of this vacation, and had to cancel reservations as a result. They gave me a $200 voucher. Seriously? I don't even want to fly with them again. what good is a voucher going to do? Disgusting!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Roanoke to Portland,April 2017,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Aegean Airlines,2.0,K Morrison,12th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Aegean used to be a good airline but in the last 2 years they have been adopting some low cost airline habits while keeping the fares quite high. Flight A3601 from London Heathrow to Athens. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight but the business class check in was closed. Same thing happened again 2 months ago. I used the economy check in and after 20 minutes in the queue I was told by the airport staff that unfortunately Aegean pay to have their business class check in open for less time than all other airlines in T2 and so it would open later. Shocking! Aegean, if you can't afford to have business class check in open, do not sell business class tickets or do not fly to Heathrow. Also, when arrived in Athens, once again the A321 full with over 200 passengers and in the middle of a storm, parked at a remote stand rather than at an air bridge. This seems to be common practice for Aegean and the excuse that all air bridges are occupied is simply not true because on this occasion nearly all of them were free. Aegean are clearly cutting corners but their fares are still very high. Their level of service though has dropped significantly to the point that it will cost them passengers. At least they lost myself! Until I know that they have reached the levels they were at two years ago, I will be flying with other Star Alliance airlines only and unfortunately from now on I do not recommend Aegean.",A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Chania via Athens,March 2017,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,2.0,W Burg,8th July 2014,Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight. We almost missed our connecting to this flight because only 30 minutes was allotted between flights.

Emirates,7.0,D Lysaght,5th June 2014,19th May CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LHR 31st May LHR-DXB-BKK-SYD-CHC. On all legs apart from DXB-LHR and LHR-DXB flew on 777-300er and on the DXB legs A380. I have to agree with others who have written about the cramped conditions imposed by the use of 3x4x3 cabin layout and the impact it has on both passenger comfort and cabin crew mobility. Of the two aircraft's I flew on I found the window seat most comfortable on the 777-300er curvature of the aircraft body interior on the A380 ate into what little legroom there was. The cabin crew for the most part was professional and good at their job however on the flight from DXB-LHR there was an issue regarding careless parents and a wilful toddler intent on roaming the aisle and not strapped in as we prepared for take off which an obviously inexperienced FA did not have the confidence to deal with. I found all food offered and on such a long series of flights there was a lot of food offered to be acceptable not amazing but acceptable and the drinks service adequate. If I asked for anything it was brought promptly and with good grace. On my return journey I had a crashing headache and had nothing to take for it in my carry-on. When asking if there was anything onboard for a headache a FA swiftly brought me two Panadol and a glass of water for which I was most grateful. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel used for my Dubai Connect transit stop. I was taken to the Arabian Park hotel and having read some of the horror stories about the Copthorne I was pleased with my allocation. However it was not easy or clear where I was to go to at DXB to avail of the Dubai Connect offer as there is no signage for it specifically and it was trial and error that found it and not due to any help from staff at DXB. If I have any complaints at all about my flights they are mostly about some of my fellow passengers who seemed to go out of their way to make the rest of us uncomfortable and the irrational 3x4x3 cabin layouts. One of these things Emirates can change the other they can't. My final thoughts about my flights are this and one concerns the blatant disregard many of my fellow passengers had for the carry on baggage protocols. The lack of enforcement regarding carry on quotas results in overhead bins being so stuffed that some of us had no space to stow baggage of legitimate size and quantity anywhere near our seats. The other being the reliance of the IFE system to divert us from the cramped cabin conditions. Let's face it no movie is going to stop FAs bumping passengers in aisle seats or avert the ridiculous situation of a 3x4x3 cabin layout.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldnâ€™t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open. After check-in, Business Class passengers were personally escorted through Immigration and Security checks and into a lounge. Not the best lounge in the world but quiet and with light snacks available. Offer of shoulder massage was tempting but I just wanted to close my eyes for an hour. At boarding time we were escorted to the gate and given immediate boarding. Before take-off given menus and was asked to complete my breakfast choices. After take-off breakfast was served.

Emirates,4.0,S Darshali,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,V Desiratne,4th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta / Paris. I was on a 3 day trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to meet my family, my sister came from London and brother came from Sri Lanka to meet me. I bought the ticket with KLM, but the flight was cancelled and they reschedule my ticket with Delta. My bags were checked in at Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta and Paris. However, from the beginning, I had bad experiences, at the check in desk two ladies refused to let me board saying that I do not have a valid visa to travel to France even though I produce them my Danish resident permit which is valid for all Schengen states. They simply gave my passport back saying that I cannot travel to France without a valid visa. (I am a Sri Lankan passport holder with a Danish resident permit). I had to speak to their supervisor, and he issued the boarding passes to only to Paris. Enquired him about the boarding pass from Paris to Copenhagen, he said I can get it from the machine once I arrived in Paris. When I arrived in Paris I tried to print my boarding pass, but I was not able to print it due to the fact that they find my flight reservation CDG to CPH. I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket. After 20 minutes thanks to Air France staff they gave my boarding pass. Once I arrived in Copenhagen my baggage did not appear. Then I asked for assistance at CPH lost baggage services to locate my baggage, and they informed me that they have no record after Atlanta. They asked me to contact Delta customer services agents. I contacted them and they were simply reading back to me what is on the Delta website and asked me to wait or either file a lost baggage complain. As per the telephone conversation with Delta baggage services on Saturday, they said they will deliver the baggage to my United States address as they do not have information regarding my baggage. Saturday the 10th December around 10.30pm they rang me and informed me that my baggage arrived at CPH and they are going to deliver it to my hotel. However, I could not hand over those to him as baggage was delivered to me around 11.00pm Danish time Saturday the 10th December, after my brother left Copenhagen. He flew back to Sri Lanka on the 10th December. I was really stressed out as I had to carry the Christmas gifts back to the US and I have no other way to deliver the gifts before Christmas. Moreover, I have to carry that 16kg back to Denmark next time. I asked them for extra compensation as they ruined my holiday as well as I have to find another way of sending the stuff to my family which I already bought for them. I don't think anyone would spend the US $1200 just for 3 days travel if the trip is not really important. Due to their mistake, my holiday was ruined and I could not fulfil the purpose of my travel.

This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice.

Alitalia,1.0,B Ivans,5th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | We have not yet even flown with Alitalia but experience so far has been very poor indeed. We had been warned about the airline but we had no choice in the matter. The forthcoming long flight due in January persuaded us to book comfort seats so we had extra leg room. Not cheap at Â£75 each on each flight. When I rang I was told I couldn't book these seats because I am over 65 (my wife is younger). When challenged they told me it was because the seats were by the emergency exits. After much discussion they said they would book them but could not guarantee that I would be able to board the plane. She said this is explained on their website. I checked and this is not so, it just says that passengers must be fit and able which I am. Emailed to complain about this but no reply. Tried again but no reply. Eventually I contacted the Customer Services Manager (not possible to email CEO unfortunately). She replied that their staff are really experienced and knew that age itself was not a barrier and I could book. She said she would remind their telephone staff. When I rang to try and book again I was once more was asked if I was over 65. When I said yes she went away to check if I could use these seats and eventually said she would book them. I was told I would get an email by reply - I didn't so phoned again and was told they would email me - they didn't. Emailed Customer Services Manager again to tell her of my recent experience. She emailed me back to say that their telephone staff would not have raised the issue of age and in fact it was me that raised it and because this had never been asked about before. This was absolutely not true. I went back to the CSM to tell her that she was being mislead and felt aggrieved that I was being blamed for the confusion.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Kim E Johansen,18th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.",Boeing 777-300ER / A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul,October 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes

The irony is there were many flights same day which successfully taken off from Boston and landed in Nantucket same time with canceled JB flight. Not been stopped by weather. Looks like when you are JetBlue and have a lot of free seats next day on others flights, nothing prevents to cancel a flight and save a lot of money - no matter what plans people have.

I chose the cod which was delicious and perfectly prepared. Dinner preceded by drinks with warm nuts, an appetizer (smoked salmon), and a salad with a choice of dressings each served as a separate course. Dinner was then followed by a cheese chart first with port then ice cream sundaes. The service was very good.

The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however.

For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior. She actually rose her voice with us when we asked to speak to someone else and said she had the authority to make these decisions. There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times.

United Airlines,8.0,B Aune,22nd December 2014,"Sat in 24D on an Airbus 320 from Seattle to Newark. This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,yes

On both segments I was impressed by the personalized service provided by cabin staff. The meals were delicious and plenty of drinks. The business class product on both flights YUL-YYC and YYC-NRT was dated, old, but the FA made it feel great.

Virgin America,10.0,P Rass,22nd December 2015,"I was flying with Virgin America today and I was impressed. The seat comfort was amazing. Being 6/7, flying is not always easy. However, VA had lots of space for my legs and seats felt like being made for my size. It felt very comfortable. Even the headrest was high enough (which did not happen to me yet and I am a frequent flyer). Neither Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and others had this comfort. The entertainment system offered everything you wanted. Movies, music, games, food and drink orders. In general, the plane seemed very modern. When ordering a gin tonic (the 50ml gin bottle was told to cost 8$, which is a regular price for short haul flights) they offered me 2 for 1 bottles. Soda was free. As I bought my ticket via Skypicker and had a connection flight, I cannot tell how much the single flight was which makes it difficult to state anything about value for money. Ground service was very solid and friendly, no complaints. Cabin staff could have been a little bit more friendly. When I was asking for an emergency exit seat (one emergency exit row was kept empty as any passenger could upgrade their seat for $150, which I think is a lot, especially having that great seat comfort, which I did not know at that time), the cabin staff was not overly friendly, however, they have not been rude at any time. Altogether, I would absolutely recommend Virgin America, at least when they are using the plane I was flying in.

Next we have the bathroom, which I will say is the worst! It was so tight and dirty. The food was disgusting and sloppy (Photo).

Jetblue Airways,,Heather Roberstein,22nd August 2010,"JFK to Austin TX. I really thought the competitive advantage that Jetblue had over other airlines was the CEO vision of being a ""friendly airline"". I remember the blue chips and jokes that the crews made before take-off when Jetblue started up. That is no longer the case. An older gentleman in the front row of my flight asked for a snack while the flight attendant was taking beverage orders. She spoke to him in a very rude tone and stated that she would not serve any snacks until she was finished with the beverage service. The gentlemen had no time between flights to eat. The food was an arm length away from her but she refused. She was very rude to another woman who placed her carry on in an overhead two rows up from her seat. She made her move it one compartment over. And Jetblue what is with the manual emergency instructions - with built in televisions we have to watch a manual instruction? Jetblue will not see me back as a customer. The prices are higher than the other airlines unless they are flying you on a special.

Half way through boarding pilot announces that there is a crack in the windshield, so we have to deplane. We are moved to a new plane at another gate, but our crew decides not to bother moving, so we are told that because there is now no crew, we will not be flying. Told to go to Customer Services to get hotel vouchers and meal vouchers. The line at Customer Services is over 3 hours long. Yes, 3 hours. We wait and wait and wait. Customer service staff could not be ruder. They say ""there are no hotels, you can book your own but American Airlines will not pay more than US$ 75"". I ask where we are supposed to sleep. ""On the floor"" said the agent. I ask for my bags to be returned, and am told this will not be possible. I have to pay $30 for a taxi and $230 for a hotel and wear dirty clothes again. Next day I get the flight to Santo Domingo, and check with agent in business class lounge and also at gate that my bags are boarding. Both confirm yes. When I arrive at Santo Domingo, no bags.

The seats are below market competition (I compare with Alitalia, Swiss, Iberia, Cathay and Qatar), and the food is not up to the standards of a Business Class. At least not what I use to fly regularly. The lounge is nice but the way you provide drinks and food is definetely the cheapest I have seen so far. Not a Business Class lounge at all.

United Airlines,1.0,B Goldman,9th March 2015,I flew from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to DC with a connection in Houston. There were literally thousands of people waiting to check in to United flights in PVR with lines stretching the length of the entire terminal. Only four check in desks were open one was even closed. There were no announcements and a United rep went through the lines asking for passengers on the next flight only once. Flights out of PVR were delayed by as much as 2 hours or more. There was no help in Houston for people who would miss their connections. I arrived at my gate just before the door closed and the sullen attendant at the desk refused to ask permission for me to board. A few minutes later the door even opened to let out a passenger who had been checked into the wrong flight and the (now two) attendants refused to try to get me on board. This was the last flight out to DC and as a result I had to stay overnight in Houston. All told it took me 26 hours to travel from PVR to DC entirely due to United's incompetence and non-existent communications. A true nightmare.,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Good to their word they got us to Denver an hour and a half late missing our connection maintenance issues was the reason. We had managed to rebook our connection in Albuquerque the agent assuring us our luggage would remain in Denver. Now it's 10pm no luggage and waiting in line with approximately 400 people to get to one service desk. 2 Hours later we have a hotel voucher and nothing else talked to some low level manager who couldn't understand why 2 full fare first class customers were upset after all we got a free hotel room.,,,First Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ivan Nikitin,27th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Moscow Vnukovo to Istanbul return in economy. Online service was a nightmare, the website is not loading properly, aircraft maps were screwed up, which made it impossible to order the seats you want. On the way to Istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology. The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight. Personal screens are great, but I found the quality of programming and translation to Russian is poor. Meal service was good, with a choice of alcohol, metal cutlery. The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies. The flight was uneventful, but the ground staff attitude to the passengers, and inability to solve problems created by Turkish Airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly Turkish Airlines ever again.",A321 / Boeing 737-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,VKO to IST,February 2017,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

They told me I still might make my connecting flight from Denver to OKC, but if not, they would switch my flight to Tulsa which took off 35 minutes later. She said they'd take care of everything mid-air. They told us on the plane there would be CS reps to help us with our connections. It was one guy who simply asked where you were going and he'd direct you to the gate. I walked 30+ gates away to get to my connecting flight. They didn't have me in the system, and didn't have my luggage transferred. He sent me back to a United customer service desk that turned out to be closed when I got there. He closed the gate, so I couldn't make Tulsa either. So I had to go back 30 gates, stand in line for 2 hours, and be told I wouldn't be able to get to OKC until about 12:30. There were so many people in the customer service line, not just people from our flight. I didn't see this with any other airline as I walked through DIA. Once I finally got through the long line, the lady at the Customer Service desk was friendly and helpful as she could be given the circumstances, but United really blew it and I missed my mother's funeral.

Southwest Airlines,2.0,Brooke Domagala,4th March 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | Baltimore to Tampa. I had surgery 6 days prior and had medical documentation stating I was not to lift anything over 2 pounds or walk extended distances. I was not even supposed to fly but I was going to see a specialist on Maryland so the restrictions were put in place and we arranged wheelchair assistance. I had zero issues the flight to BWI. The trip back was an absolute nightmare and completely unacceptable. We landed in Tampa after a turbulent flight which in turn heightened my pain. I was 1 of 5 people that had boarded with wheelchair assistance. When we landed we were advised that the wheelchairs weren't available yet. Fortunately the other 4 people were able to walk off the aircraft without a problem. I advised the stewardess of my restrictions and stated I would wait. Everyone had gotten off and the stewardess asked me to walk off. I again told her I could not. They cleaned the plane a bit and again told me I needed to get off. I did not fight it and advised them I could not lift my bag and they carried it off for me and had me stand in pain in the alleyway and wait with the entire crew. She then said I needed to go so I slowly started walking and walked most the alley way where I was then greeted with a wheelchair. The attendant then took off hitting the bump off the gate. I told him I just had surgery but clearly he was in a hurry. This is absolutely unacceptable. I legitimately needed help and had arranged for assistance on advance with documentation stating my restrictions. If there weren't any wheelchairs available I should not have been forced to walk in pain when I was advised by a medical professional otherwise. I had physical proof with me and this trip was not made by choice. I called and filed a complaint with customer service and was advised I would get a response within 10 days. This is unacceptable!

I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well.

We ended up on this flight as our original flight which was to Montreal via air Canada was cancelled at the very last minute without warning and we had to rebook. We arrived early boarded on time. It wasnâ€™t until we got on the tarmac and the plane was still sitting. Apparently the captain had to some systems checks and something didnâ€™t pass. Once passed about an hr had lapsed fuel has been burned so we had to return to the gate to refuel. It took a total of 2 hrs for the process and we had a connecting flight to Italy and only had a two hour layover. All the while the flight attendants could not reassure that our connecting flight would be held for us to catch. There were issues with this situation from the get go. The thought of a cancelled flight was something I understand is normal but at the 11th hr was not appropriate notification to customers. For customer safety, one would think that the pilot both the ones on the previous flight and current flight should have some system of checks for the plane well before we get on the plane for the aforementioned safety and efficiency.

Checked-in at the dedicated business class desk and was advised that UAL use the â€˜Aspireâ€™ lounge at EDI. The lounge was fine with a reasonable selection of food items for a snack breakfast. Flights are not called from the lounge. Boarding appeared to be well managed a number of supplementary security / travel questions were asked by an agent at the gate. Once onboard a welcome drink of champagne juice or water was offered. There is a 2-2 flatbed seat configuration in Business Class. The seat was comfortable with plenty of space and easy-to-use chair and In Flight Entertainment controls. The plane Departed on time at 09.05. On board service began roughly 45 minutes after departure. The main meal was lunch followed by a snack prior to arrival at EWR. In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation.

It was such a light-hearted plea, too. I thought surely in the name of customer experience, they'll understand and appreciate the fact that I'm loyal to them still and they'll do the right thing. Not so much, unfortunately. Instead, I get this canned email response below. ""We received your email and appreciate your taking the time to contact us. As a valued Customer of Southwest Airlines, your feedback is very important to us, and we welcome the opportunity to respond. A-List and A-List Preferred status provides lucrative benefits to recognize and reward our most loyal Customers, and we must rely on our Rapid Rewards Members to gain entry to these tier levels through their activity in the program. I truly understand your frustration given that you were only three flights shy of qualifying for A-List Preferred. In order to maintain the integrity of our Rapid Rewards program and continue to provide the perks associated with each tier status, we must consistently adhere to the program rules. Saying â€œnoâ€ to a request for tier status that has not been truly earned helps ensure that we are able to say â€œyesâ€ to offering benefits to our qualifying Members in the future. Your patronage and loyalty has not gone unnoticed. It's our hope that you will continue flying Southwest Airlines as it would be our privilege to welcome you onboard for many years to come.

United Airlines,1.0,H Steensen,29th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I was scheduled to fly from Washington DC (IAD) to Newark (EWR) with United Airlines and then continue via SAS from EWR to Copenhagen. Due to weather issues in the greater NY area the United flight was delayed by 6 hours and my connecting flight had left when I arrived at EWR. At IAD I had explained to United agents that my luggage was checked in all the way to Copenhagen, and that I needed guidance regarding if/how/where I needed to pick up my luggage when arriving in EWR. I was simply told to explain my situation to United agents when arriving at EWR. Following guidance from the United flight crew I stood in line for two hours to speak to a United agent at the United EWR customer care booth located next to my arrival gate. When I finally talked to an agent I was asked to go to the United baggage claim booth. After having waited another hour the United baggage claim agent informed me that she had located the luggage, but that I had to wait at least another 5 hours for my bag to be brought to the United baggage claim area. I was then told to show up 8.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage (*note that after arriving at EWR Scandinavian Airlines had manage to re-book me via American Airlines to go to Miami and then via a SAS flight to Copenhagen). By the time United told me to leave without my luggage it was 12.30 AM in the night â€“ 12.5 hours after departing IAD airport. I was offered no hotel options. After having spent 35 min a cab to reach a friendâ€™s apartment in NYC I spent another 30 min in a cab ($150 out of pocket) and returned to EWR 7.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage. A third United agent then told me that they could not locate my luggage in their system and that it likely was with SAS. I was then told that since the SAS office only opens 9 AM the right thing would have been to wait the five hours the previous night. This conversation took 30 secs and it was made very clear that this was not United problem and that I was advised to board my American Airlines flight without my luggage and file a lost luggage complaint with SAS upon arriving in Copenhagen, which I then did. I arrived in Copenhagen 8 am and had to continue straight to my air-bnb and then to the university. At this point I had slept 2-3 hours since my departure at Dulles on the 19th (2 days ago) and I had no new clothes to change into. Upon returning to IAD from Copenhagen on June 24th I still had not received my luggage. After being passed from one United agent to another at IAD I was told that my luggage was at EWR. I filed a lost luggage complaint with United and since received around 10 text messages saying that my luggage was not located. Early morning 12.39 AM on June 27th, while asleep, I get a text by a private company contracted by United stating that they are â€œattempting to deliver my luggageâ€ and I am asked to call/text to confirm my address. 6.02 AM I write back to confirm my address and I text the private agent to call me before dropping off my luggage. I leave my apartment 6.40 AM only to discover that the private agent had left my luggage outside my building without notifying me.",,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Newark,June 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Due to a technical issue, the plane didn't take off and another one was sent from Atlanta. The so-called ""rescue"" plane didn't take off from ATL before 8pm and we only left MBJ at 00:15 on the 13th. In consequence we spent the whole day at the airport (we arrived at 2:15pm). We weren't offered to stay in a hotel close by and I even had to ask the staff for something to eat. We landed in Atlanta around 3am and were charged a no show fee at the hotel. We also had to pay for the transport to the hotel as airport shuttles don't run at this time. AF customer service that's supposed to take care of that refused to compensate us as it is a US company operating a US flight. Doesn't matter that we booked from Air France. Is it really our problem that they delegate the flight to a partner? Even scarier: that ""technical"" issue was apparently a leak that prevented the plane to take off, however the plane just flew from ATL.

Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class. This was 8 hours of pure luxury although I would never pay for it as it's double the price of Business class which is also excellent on the A380.","A380, Boeing 777-300",Couple Leisure,First Class,Hong Kong to Dubai,March 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Our plane was delayed due to weather fair enough, but then we were stood on the tarmac for over 45 minutes as they boarded customer who then decided to not fly on that flight so their bags had to be taken off. As the flight was delayed this should of been sorted out earlier as there was plenty of time to do so. We had to get a connecting flight which meant it was going to be close whether we made it or not. However when things settled down, and I pressed the assistance button not 1 member of staff showed up, therefore I had to go looking for help. When I finally asked they were less than welcoming with the vaguest of answers about us making our connecting flight. Luckily we made the flight with minutes to spare. We asked for a snack before our inflight meal but nothing was available. Again staff were not helpful and kept offering us drink which was of no us to use and meant we had gone 8 hours with nothing but a sandwich on the last flight.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,6.0,A van der Made,6th July 2014,Flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo Narita via SVO and back. First flight from AMS to SVO on codeshare flight with KLM on B738. Flight was OK. Transit on SVO from terminal E to D was a breeze. There were no lines at immigration or security check. As we had a stopover for 6 hours we used the capsule hotel which was accessible from terminal D and E on airside (63 Euros for 4 hours). Flight from SVO to NRT was on an A333. Nice and new aircraft with good seats and complete IFE. We had 4 seats in a row for the two of us as the aircraft was about half full. Crew was attentive and quitte friendy. With one hour delay we arrived at NRT. The flight from NRT back to SVO gave us however some mixed emotions. on an A333 but with a crew that wasn't as friendly as the flight to NRT. We got the feeling we were bothering them even with some basic requests for drinks. Toilets were very dirty on this flight not only the fault of the crew as well as fellow passengers. Transit from terminal D to E on SVO was a mess. At immigration and security check there were long lines with a lot of people cutting lines. Flight from SVO to AMS on an A320 was better than the flight from NRT. Aircraft was however in a bit of a run down state and also quite dirty. Toilet was also in a poor state. The crew however was extremely friendly and flight arrived on time. In the end Aeroflot gave us mixed feelings. If you don't have many expectations for the price you pay for the flight the airline is OK. At SVO you need either luck or a lot of patience concerning transits of flights.

They should have had two hours from touchdown in Miami to catch the connection to St Thomas. The flight from Heathrow arrived 50 minutes late.

It caused us having to change hotel and other reservations several times, and having to stay at some cities longer (or shorter). Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago. As for the flights themselves, they were ok. Service was ok, a bit inconsistent on some flights. Some planes were older, others are newer. Cabins and bathrooms were clean, seats were comfortable. Food were enjoyable, although quality was a little inconsistent too. In Turkey airports, you do get special privileges for flying with Turkish Airlines Business Class, so that is something to consider if flying to Turkey.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LAX to JNB via IST,December 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes
Aeromexico,4.0,Ludwig Fun,21st March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flight from Amsterdam to Mexico was OK, the seat was comfortable enough and sitting in 6J with an infant on the first row of economy class right behind I was lucky enough to have a quiet flight. Service was attentive and the food, while lacking in presentation, was edible. The trouble started upon arrival in Mexico City at 3am, where I was to connect to a flight on the same business class ticket, but operated by Avianca. Iâ€™d chosen this connection for its shorter layover time. The transfer desk in the arrivals hall at MEX was unmanned, so I proceeded on my own to the departure hallâ€™s Aeromexico check-in area where I was told to switch terminals to check-in with Avianca. Since the monorail was not operating at that hour I was supposed to take a taxi. Once at the Avianca check-in counter it became clear that I was booked in economy to Bogota. Nowhere during booking was this evident (I even retraced my booking steps on the same connection at a later date to verify any mention of travel in economy). It seemed that the AV was already overbooked (i.e. known to Aeromexico) at the time of booking. Aside from the economy experience on a business class ticket, the less than smooth connection at MEX, Aeromexico took 6 weeks to respond to my complaint. Their Twitter account ignored me completely and when I received an e-mail response, letâ€™s just say that, for the result, in the end I might as well not have complained at all. On the return flight, no connection issues, however the food both out of BOG and MEX was subpar and the service was distracted and messy especially on the long haul stretch. Comming into AMS I had to ask for coffee creamer twice (coffee was poured and no milk or creamer was at hand on the trolley) and I had to grasp it from the purserâ€™s fingers as she dangled it over me when she came back from the galley talking to someone else. I left the omelet untouched, because I couldnâ€™t identify its filling and it tasted of nothing.

The flight to Providence RI still arrived pretty much on time despite the blizzard. Southwest delivered my bags to my door the next day. Everyone was courteous from check-in to arrival.

United Airlines,6.0,John Clifford,7th December 2015,"United Airlines staff at the airports and on the plane were polite and efficient. The smaller Embraer jets are nice for the single traveler, as they're designed with a single seat on the right side, so you get both window and aisle. The extra leg room in economy plus seating is worth the extra expense ($30-$45 on the segments I flew). The seats themselves are adequate, but not comfortable. This is an industry wide problem, and not in any way unique to United. The biggest disappointment is the WiFi service. From previous experience, it seems to work very well on their Airbus fleet. The Airbus fleet usually does not have tv screens in the seat backs, so the WiFi service on those planes comes with a library of movies and TV shows to watch. This works very well if you've got a tablet or some other device to watch them on. The Boeing portion of their fleet is another matter entirely. The more recent planes have the TV screens in the seats. There's a basic program that runs during the flight, but if you want to watch anything else, there's a fee. The WiFi service on the Boeing aircraft also seems to be spotty at best. It hasn't worked at all on 3 of the 4 segments I've flown in the last couple months. The Embraer planes fly the short routes. I have yet to come across one of these with WiFi service or a seat back screen. But, given the flights I've been on have only been about 90 minutes, this isn't a big problem. Bottom line: bring a tablet or small computer and download a couple of movies on it first.",E145 / Boeing 737-900,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,SCE to LAS via ORD,November 2015,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,yes

The interesting part of this was, we only walked up to the kiosk to ask them if it was a possibility to upgrade our seats. We weren't expecting it, only asking if it was a possibility. Interestingly enough, the American Airlines attendant told us there was not point in talking to them unless we did it 24 hours in advanced. I don't care about that. I just wanted to ask.

Emirates,7.0,S Donalla,6th October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dubai to New York JFK. This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent! The aircrew were truly professional and made every effort to accommodate us. Hopefully our next trip with Emirates would be better experience. The weak link as always is the ground staff.

Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service.

Customer service is almost non existent, the $200 change fee is uncalled for especially for frequent fliers.

For some reason in my experience one out of every 30 flights gets cancelled (or just my luck) for a non distinct reason, I don't want to accuse but usually I can intuitionally predict when this will happen, that is when I see that its substantially empty a week before the flight. Delays are ever more frequent, in the last three flights we had a 30 minute delay because they were still loading bags, three other delays for flight attendants not in or pilots not in yet. No snacks, and the food for purchase which is not much is usually not even available as they stock very little of it and the tempting items are taken quickly. The advantage program keeps getting changed not for the better. If the prices were cheap I would not complain as much. The few planes that have the new IFE system carry vey little media and no free tv, also the gogo in flight is really too expensive for the average passenger, if it was a reasonable rate I would use it for other than the occasional free partial pass. Bottom line American used to be just ok, now its just subpar and expensive.",,Business,Economy Class,SJU to MIA,December 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Boarded and got off the plane both times because of an issue, you think they would have resolved that before letting everyone get on. They let us sit forever blaming it on catering and other various issues. Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m glad they didnâ€™t fly with any detrimental issues to the aircraft but come on. Also both times, there was an error with calculating carry one baggage leaving no room for the last passengers to board and they did not complimentary check any.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,M Sharma,6th June 2015,"TK 80 SFO to IST in business class. Best transatlantic business class product out there. Its food and service can give any European carrier's First class a run for their money. So much food and drink. Then there are airlines which don't serve even a meal when travelling First Class on a 5 hour flight because its ""domestic"" (eg United). They kept serving us food for the first 3 hours of the 12 hour flight. Entertainment system: Latest one not even shared publicly on the airline website. Touch screen remote which itself has a large interactive LCD screen/player works independent to the main screen! Movie choices: Amazing! Audio albums: Biggest collection I've seen. Seat is a bit narrow however very comfortable to sleep in. Amenity kits were from Cerruti. Although arrival in Istanbul was disappointing due to delayed baggage delivery. The only unfortunate thing is this is their best product and will probably not be used in Asia ever because Turkish heavily favours US destinations over others. eg.

American Airlines,8.0,Evan McCarty,9th February 2016,"I've flown dozens of domestic flights with American Airlines, and generally find the experience to be somewhere between tolerable and very good. This route, the service was quite good. I had the same crew on both the AUS-DFW and DFW-ORD legs, and they were quite pleasant and even recognized that I was on both of their flights. Despite the very short duration of the Austin to Dallas flight, they attempted to serve everyone onboard the drink of their choice (not just water), which was quite impressive. I appreciated the effort and polite service of the crew. My only criticism was the plane - American Airlines MD80's are very old, and it shows. No power outlets, out of date looking fixtures, etc. I was a bit surprised they would choose to use this plane on the relatively lengthy DFW-ORD flight.",MD80,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AUS to ORD via DFW,February 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,yes

I went to the agent at airport and she said she Couldnâ€™t change the account and that I have to email the headquarters. I emailed the headquarters a week ago and nothing got done about it.

Air Canada,1.0,E Dutton,25th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Vancouver via Calgary. We received several itineraries by email. I didn't realize that each one of these was an itinerary change. The last one moved our flight time up from 7:10 to 6:30am. Having 2 small children, we got to the ticket counter at 5:35 am which was plenty of time for our first flight time, but they would not let us on the flight because we missed the 1 hour check in by 5 minutes. The lady at the counter was unhelpful and rude. I called the rebooking number and they said there was another flight that same day (the lady at the counter said there wasn't). The rep on the phone said we need to book with the lady at the counter because it would cost much more if she did it on the phone. I went back to the lady at the counter and she was still completely unhelpful even when talking to the rep on the phone. The rep on the phone spoke with her supervisor who gave it to us at the same price because the rep at the counter refused to help. $450 later and hauling 2 very young children around at 4:30 am for no reason because our flight was changed without real notification (the email never stated there was an itinerary change that I noticed), I am extremely unsatisfied. Flight home- My husband was detained by US Dept of Homeland Security. While this was not the fault of Air Canada, it took them almost 2 hours to get them his bags to be checked. He almost missed this flight as well and I was in the airport in Calgary for over 2 hours with 2 small children by myself because of this delay. This was my husband's first time to fly.

I was charged $75 for the change. I tried to check in online 90 minutes prior to departure three times with no success. I called customer service and asked them for assistance and they said you can only check in online and at the airport. I arrived to the ticket counter 30 minutes prior to my flight and she said this is odd, I can see you are on this flight but there are no seats. I asked how that could be. She even called a coworker over and they said all we can do is put you on standby for the next flight. I was pretty upset and proceeded through security to the gate arriving 15 minutes prior to departure time. I asked the girl at the gate counter why my seat was given away and she called a gentleman over and they whispered as they looked on the screen. She asked him if she should pull ""her"" from the plane. She then closed the door and locked it. He stood there as if I should just walk off gingerly. I debated with him about why their antics were bad business and his only come back was that I should have checked in earlier. I said like 90 minutes earlier like I tried to do. Not everyone can be at the gate 2 hours prior to a flight. This is 2016 - that's what technology is for which American Airlines is obviously struggling with. Not to mention customer service. I called customer service again, this time speaking to an agent who was nice but obviously thought her level of kindness was equaled by my ignorance. She put me on hold for a few minutes after hearing my story and has the audacity to come back and say I got you on the 8:15 flight. I asked the flight I'm already on after getting dumped on by your company? She said it's the least I can do. I said what about a refund or a voucher or waiving the $75 I had to pay for a flight you gave my seat away on which had I known was going to happen would have never changed to? She said I'm afraid I can't do anything sir. This is all comical now but being a business guy I can see huge inefficiencies in operations and customer service.

Other people also having to deal with the ""difficult"" stewardess resulting in further delays to a flight that already had been delayed by 30 mins.

Emirates,4.0,C Billington,25th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Tried Emirates for the first time from London to Melbourne via Dubai, UK having previously travelled Singapore Airlines. The difference could not be more stark. My experience on the outbound flights was not good and unless something pretty good happens on the way back, I wouldn't recommend them or use them again. The positive was the entertainment system which was good quality and a good selection and check in was efficient and pleasant. Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times. The second leg of the flight was extremely cold in the cabin and despite people raising it, it didn't improve. Blankets all round. Broadband was woeful despite paying for it and I gave up in the end.

Air Canada,1.0,P Knowles,18th October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Sudbury with Air Canada. For a while I was purposefully flying Air Canada over other carriers as I enjoyed their new inflight entertainment options, but I've reached the point where enough is enough. I could have excused the fact that on about a third of the flights I've taken the sound or screen is broken, as technology fails. I could have excused that they keep adding new fees such as a fee to choose your seat in advance (not just for legroom anymore, for any seat). But this time I feel that I've run into an inexcusably unethical practice that has significantly disrupted my vacation plans. I've been on a multiple-destination vacation, which will take me on 6 flights. Air Canada's pricing structure made it costly to mix and match airlines, so all six flights were with Air Canada. I had decided to cancel the third flight, and drive the distance instead, so that I could see more family members. I didn't care if they charged me for the flight, I just wanted to notify them of the change of plans. When I called Air Canada, they told me that if I did this, they would charge me nearly $400, a $200 cancellation fee as well as the increased cost of the fourth flight, as it would need to be ""re-booked"". Then they told me that if I didn't pay this amount and didn't show up for the third flight, they would cancel the fourth flight. So even though I was willing to pay the same for less service, they wanted to charge me substantially more. They didn't offer any justification, I'm assuming that it's just designed to take advantage of people who are in a tough spot and have to change their plans, regardless of whether it increases the airline's cost. Pure greed. Even if it leads to additional administration, I couldn't see this amount being reasonable. Then, to top it off, I had asked if I could pay more to switch my last two flights to a later time. Online the price was $761 if I was booking a new flight. However, I was told that to make this change they would charge me almost an extra $1000.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,S Healen,13th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Kahului to Salt Lake City. Most ridiculous experience Iâ€™ve ever had with an airline! Delta dropped the ball so many times over the last 48 hours that Iâ€™m seriously considering never using them again. Iâ€™m thankful they realized a problem with the plane before we took off, but they were seriously incompetent from that point on. We unboarded the plane around midnight, weâ€™re told that we were on our own to find a hotel (at midnight), but they ended up helping some people secure a hotel, taxi, etc from a different kiosk. We ended up sleeping on a freezing cold concrete floor by the baggage claim, on one of the coldest night Maui has had in 10 years. It was pouring rain and windy as hell. They were actually getting snow on the peaks of Haleakala. We were told to go grab our luggage, but TSA was closed once we got down there, so we werenâ€™t able to go back upstairs in the warm enclosure. Those who stayed up there were given blankets, pillows, and water, but the 6 of us downstairs were left to fend for ourselves. And thatâ€™s just weâ€™re the drama began. One thing after another, over and over again, we dealt with issues from the Delta employees. People who didnâ€™t know what they were doing whatsoever. More delays, sending info for the wrong runway, and BS from employees in Utah once we finally landed, 3 hours late, at 2:30 AM. 48 hours of no sleep, rude and ignorant employees, and no info relayed to those of us on the flight. Letâ€™s just say that Iâ€™m glad to be home!

After trying to figure out how to enter my credit number in online I was lost and frustrated. Called the company and can only do it over the phone, and now was forced to pay an additional 20$ to the 40$ increase already, to a ""main cabin fee"" vs basic economy(which I originally purchased) because it is their policy. After much complaining and speaking with supervisors I was finally given the basic economy price-still 40$ more than my originally purchased ticket.

My partner and I have flown to Phoenix, St Lucia, and NYC all within the last year. We have not had one vacation without a significant delay on either the departure, arrival, or both. Tonight we were delayed by 6 hours. The delays, such as this evening, have been due to mechanical issues. I can appreciate valuing everyone's safety, however the volume and length of delays has forced us to view Air Canada as unreliable. We have missed out on nights of hard-earned vacations, and even worse, time spent with family. A few food vouchers for airport food, at airport food prices is simply not sufficient for the repeated inconvenience and frustration we have experienced. Air Canada has told us on many occasions that they appreciate our business, however they have certainly missed opportunities to show us.

Emirates,2.0,T Lanner,13th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stony faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains havenâ€™t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final â€œthank you for flying Emiratesâ€ sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customersâ€™ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers.

The way the airline dealt with us following the alleged baggage system crash on 27th Feb was appalling. Despite the fact that aircrew know that most passengers baggage had not been loaded no information was provided during the flight or at the airport. Instead we were left forlornly waiting at the carousel. By the time people twigged what was happening the two ground staff at the information desk were besieged. They were totally unprepared and chaos ensued. Essentially people were abandoned to their own devices with no attempt to communicate or put contingency arrangements in place. This was a repeat of our experience last year which we attributed to a one off aberration. Frankly you can have all the comfort and good food you like but if your customers walk away feeling angry and frustrated you will not get repeat business.

No real inconvenience but it felt slightly odd to be on the bus driving around for so long. The second issue was with the food that was served on the Tokyo flight. I had the oriental vegetarian meal booked and I genuinely have no idea what the main portion of my meal was.

They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand.""

I understood their situation as they could not provide me with any flight for that day as there are no seats available. After long waits we finally reached home with boarding passes for the following day. We woke up early again in the morning and checked the status online on United Airlines website. It mentioned there is a delay in flight timings but the scheduled time of departure is still shown at 6.10 am. I thought they will send an email or a text message incase if there is really one. And once again after paying for the cabs and reaching there on time we found that the flight is delayed by 4 hours. I felt deceived. I spoke to an attendant as to why I was not informed about the delay and she told I will get back to me in a moment and went on serving the customers at other kiosk without ever bothering to respond me. I then waited for 15 minutes to speak with another one and she asked how I made my resevation and I explained her it was through Priceline. And she tried to blame them as it is their fault and they have to inform me. I told her that these were new boarding passes which were issued by United Airlines at the kiosk. Her response ""Yeah right. I dont know"". I told her it is not a problem if there is a delay but it is your responsibility to inform me so that I would not have come early. Her response, ""I know but i cant do anything. You could wait at the airport or leave and then come back at around 9.30 am as that is when the boarding starts"". Is she going to pay us for the cabs? Cant they see what efforts we might have gone through to come to airport in the icy conditions with heavy luggage? She then tried to blame the weather when I told her the flight to and from the same locations in Southwest is running at scheduled time. Then she said, ""I don't control anything here. I don't know why the scheduled time in website was not updated"". In the end, I have to leave the counter with frustration. I dont see an inch of regret or an apology from their side for their mistake. We just sat there doing nothing and looked at the timings of other flights. There were few other flights whose status is either cancelled or delayed and all of them belonged to United Airlines.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,OMA to SFO via DEN,December 2016,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,7.0,Christopher Rainbow,1st November 2016,âœ… Verified Review | United Airlines (UA131) from Dublin to Newark proved to be quite an experience. Dublin airport offers pre-clearance and as such I was attracted to the flight with United Airlines. First impressions count and I am afraid that I was not at all impressed with the gate staff â€“ some of whom were in United uniforms and boarded the flight after their gate duties. Their rudeness towards an elderly couple was disgusting and simply ignorant. Boarding was done in groups. Some passengers did not have their groups shown on their tickets and the staff had an aloof manners towards those who simply asked for the process to be explained. One staff member was particularly rude and obnoxious and seemed to enjoy being so. The flight is operated using a Boeing 757. The aircraft is rather comfortable but compact. The safety procedures were taken seriously and a video shown. During this flight I had to contend with an malfunctioning inflight entertainment system. Only a few TVs worked and the sound / volume was not controllable. The journey map did not work properly as only the distances were displayed. The couple next to me gave up on their IFE as theirsâ€™s did not work either. My arm rest was not working correctly either. The catering was good and drinks were served regularly during the flight. I was impressed with the captain who made clear announcements and was very professional and welcoming. The Captain made a point of saying farewell to departing passengers in person. I had to collect my second boarding pass in Newark and the first uniformed United staff member I spoke to was indifferent and made no effort to even speak to me but pointed me along the concourse. The second uniformed United staff member I spoke to get my boarding pass was actually very friendly and polite and informative too. I also had positive impressions of ground staff who operated the transfer bus between terminals and could not praise them enough for being helpful. The price I paid for the ticket was not the cheapest and I think in future I shall try a rival company.,Boeing 757,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DUB to EWR,October 2016,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,yes
Emirates,8.0,Chia Ty,23rd June 2014,12/6/14 EK355 SIN-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Interior well maintained despite plane being 7-8 years old. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like SQ and CX does. Dinner service 1.5 hrs after take off and drinks another 30m later. People's throats were parched by then. People then begun pressing call buttons this could have been avoided if a simple drink run was done. Food was really good with choices between sweet and sour chicken and beef with mashed potatoes. I had the former and dessert was good too. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. No drink runs nor snacks provided after that although menu said so that was disappointing so 1 star less for F&B.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Boeing 777 on all legs apart from London to Doha which was an A380. No real complaints about the planes or cabin crew. Entertainment good, good leg room (although I'm only 1.7m). Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious.

The flight to Dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in Dallas. I finally got to Lubbock at 10.50. The next morning I went on Southwest.com and went to see if my points had posted I found out they didn't so I called Southwest and they told me that I didn't receive my points because I missed my original flight.

United Airlines,1.0,Alexis Flowers,10th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | After arriving at the airport at 4:30am in San Diego we flew into Chicago. Little did we know we would not be leaving that airport for 36 hours. Our flight to our destination was scheduled to leave at 6pm. After our gate got changed 10 times and our flight got delayed further and further we scurried up and down stairs to each one. We then arrived at the last gate at 9:30pm. We sat and sat and were told no updates. We then were told we were waiting on the plane to arrive that we were flying out. The plane landed. BUT we only have one pilot, so we waited for another plane to land for a second pilot. Thenone of the flight attendants timed out on her shift and could no longer board our flight home. BUT by the time the other plane landed the staff timed out as we watched them walk right out of the gangway to the plane passed us never to be seen again. So, we waited on another plane for a whole new crew. We were assured for the first announcement over the intercom of the night that we were heading out soon! At this point it is 11:30pm. 30 minutes later, at 12am, we are notified that the flight is cancelled. after waiting 9 hours and running around the airport, it is canceled. This is not even the worst of it. We call United customer service to see what can be done 2 times (go ahead and listen to those calls- they are pathetic) only to be told there are no more flights to JAX and that we cannot be helped. The couple in front of us got another flight booked automatically that left 6am the next day why our customer service experience was so different is beyond me. We ended up buying the only flight we could in a different airport. We ended up purchasing a flight from MDW in Chicago to JAX. Sometime after purchasing the flight I was so relieved to find one! That is until I realized the flight I purchased from Delta airlines was on September 27th when I need to leave ORD right then and there on now what is September fourth. So with even more stress added, I am out over $500 more dollars, I still have no way home, I have nowhere to stay no way to travel, I donâ€™t have my luggage, I am defeated. So, after searching for some more time, there are no flights out of ORD to JAX for 2 more days. I ended up purchasing another flight for $935.60 from a different airline and airport in Chicago that did not leave until 1 pm the next day. We were left with no other choice but the sleep on the ground. So, it is now 1:30am. We are wondering where is my luggage that has everything I need in it and were told our luggage went to JAX already without us. It didnâ€™t make sense. So, we then stood in another line and were told that our luggage is at ORD but if we exit to get it, we cannot get back in until the morning. So, we agreed to get our luggage in the morning before we spend another $40+ dollars to transfer to MDW where our new flight is.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Jacksonville,September 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

A text from them told me they cancelled our flights due to 'Operational Requirements' 6 weeks before our holiday and to ring them. They offered night flights several days later or to travel 5.5 hours to fly from Heathrow. Work, Pre-booked Trains. hotels and ferries meant we had to travel on that day from Manchester as Heathrow was Â£300 more for us to get there at short notice. At no point were they going to meet extra travel costs or compensate the 4 of us in any way other than refund our flights which we have had to do. Why they didn't provide a coach to transport people from Manchester - Heathrow I don't know and the unsympathetic attitude to our prearranged details astounded us. The result is we are flying with an alternative airline at a cost of Â£500 more per couple. Customer Services are next to useless and online only as there's nobody you can talk to in person. I'm still awaiting my refund which they say will take 10-15 working days. Today it's come to our attention that they're operating a flight out of Manchester on the morning our flight was due to depart via Brussels which would get us to Athens at a similar time to what we should have arrived.

On my second last flight KLM 705 on April 10 the cabin crew were excellent whereupon KLM 705 June 16 cabin staff were of a very low level. Some staff will do everything so the guest will enjoy the journey while another crew sees the guest mostly as a distraction to their work.

Boarding was efficient, and we departed on time. Economy plus seats gave additional legroom, and this was much appreciated. The 3-3-3 configuration is a little cramped width-wise, you just have to hope that your fellow passengers are on the petite size. Seats were equipped with headrests, but no foot-rests. Blankets and pillow provided, and earphones. IFE was pretty good - sharp, touch screen, reasonable selection of movies and TV shows and even an eclectic relaxation channel. Downside was audio - no selectable tracks, just a series of themed audio tracks which meant you just have to leave it on and wait for songs to appear. Food choices ranged from tolerable to OK, basically it's calories to sustain you. Crew ranged from relatively indifferent to briskly efficient. The Dreamliner made it a little more tolerable, with reduced noise levels even in economy. The biggest downside was that despite the adequate legroom, I found it really hard to get comfortable in the chairs - I can't explain it. Perhaps a combination of thin padding and/or compressed width? At the end, it was a flight to be endured rather than enjoyed, but perhaps that is a good outcome for a United flight.",Boeing 787-8,Business,Economy Class,Tokyo to Denver,January 2019,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no

Nothing except a standard lunch after take off and then a disgusting vegetable baked good just before landing. 7 hours daytime flying with no food. What a joke. On the next leg from Dubai dinner was a turkey ham roll and that was it for 7 hours until an inedible breakfast was offered. Cheese and cracker with breakfast? Demonstrative of the lack of care and attention by emirates. Dirty planes. Smelly toilets. I will never fly Emirates again. How reviewers are consistently rating Emirates above BA is beyond me and as we know BA is hardly a high benchmark. A massive TV screen and a large selection of films does not make up for a budget service.

SFO to IAD on a 757-200 that had to be 25 years old with CRT IFE from 1990. FA's were excellent but the plane needs to be retired. Overall a good trip and I truly think once United modernizes its fleet it needs to decide if it wants to compete with the foreign carriers. If so maybe a few less seats in business class get away from 2-4-2 configuration and perhaps better first class seating in the domestic fleet.,,,First Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Virgin America,8.0,M Weiskopf,17th August 2015,"We flew JetBlue to San Francisco due to a massive credit. JetBlue is also our airline of choice for vacation. However, JetBlue's times for San Francisco to Boston were not very compatible with our schedule, so we decided to fly Virgin America back. Check-in was fast, and before we knew it, we were at the gate with 1.5 hours before boarding. We went to a restaurant conveniently located next to the gate and returned with 15 minutes before boarding. Boarding went quickly too, and when we got on the plane, the cabin was lit up in deep purples and blues. I found that the entertainment was not quite as impressive as JetBlue's, but it was still good. The food selection could also have more variety. But those were not big problems, because the Gulfstream shortens the flight by an hour and were in Boston in 5.5 hours. Virgin only has one gate at Logan and it is located near baggage claim, which was nice because it was 11.30pm.

The ground crew was helpful as the kiosk did not work. At the ticket desk the staff put my checked in bag up on the place where it was weighed. Never had that before. She was very friendly. She was proud of the new look of her uniform. Seem to like her job.

What a disappointment. The headphone jack was not working, the recline button on my seat was not working. The seat itself was not completely fixed. It kept slipping. When the food arrived, my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasn't even hot. Some passengers could not have their first choice meal. When we landed in Dubai, we had to be bussed to the terminal. The return flight was worse. Seating in the middle of the middle row (seats E/F) is definitely a mistake. The cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. They kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. (we only wanted a cup of tea!). They even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. There was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. We found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional. All in all, a pretty disappointing experience. The A380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but I feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry.

United Airlines,2.0,Valerie Bourke,8th November 2015,"Melbourne to Los Angeles to Chicago, returning from Boston. We thought the extra money for Premium Economy worth it for the International leg. Not only is there extra legroom but there were many spare seats. So a bit of moving around enabled plenty of cabin space for these long flights. Domestic flights are an entirely different matter. On all our legs United Airlines oversold tickets to ensure every seat was taken. Their loading policy is bizaar. We were always last on (group 5) because we had asked for aisle seats. On any other airline this would probably not matter but because United does not enforce its own carry on luggage rules, the last 50 or so passengers on all the internal legs we flew, had to at the last minute submit to having their carry on luggage removed and sent under plane. This is maybe not a big deal on a short 5 hour flight but our carry on was taken off us as we came down the loading trunk and booked through to Melbourne, two whole days away. Scrabbling to get out medications etc in the unheated trunk in the freezing air of Boston Airport is no fun. (I'm 67) so difficult to get down to get stuff out let alone remember all the things you may need on such a long journey.

American Airlines,1.0,S Saunders,31st March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Kona to Indianapolis via Dallas. The fiasco started in Kona with an initial 2 hour delay. The trip was to begin at 6:30 PM but did not begin loading unitl 8:30. Then we sat on the plane until 9:30 when we started out of the tarmac and began to taxi and the pilot came over and said the check engine light has came on again, we will need to return to the gate. 30 min later he advised us that United Airlines were in our gate and we were stuck on the tarmac. At 11:00 PM the pilot said we will give everyone an opportunity to deboard the plane, but within 1-2 min after the announcement the pilot came back on the intercom and stated they needed to do a quick engine test and that all passengers were to remain seated, only those in first class had the opportunity to deboard. Those passengers including myself who were still in the process of deboarding were directed back to our seats. Then at 11:45 the staff announced we have another problem, we sat so long we needed refueled but the staff put the fuel in the wrong tank making us unequally balanced, so fuel had to be taken out and placed in the center fuel tank. At 12:30-1 we finally left Hawaii, once at Dallas we had more delays, after missing 3 connections we then headed to a gate with a Chicago destination but unfortunately they did not put my girlfriend on the flight. We were waiting again, they then rerouted us to a direct flight to Indianapolis, we had to run to get there and once again we had a 3 hour mechanical delay. The trip is now over 24 hours and we were not served a meal the entire time, there were no vouchers given for the time inconvenience, no food vouchers as only snacks were offered in the period of 6:30 PM Sunday to 6:30 PM Monday with no time in between to eat a hot meal due to all the missed connections and literally running to the next flight to be only delayed again. In all this after many emails to customer service they only provided ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience, we hope we can do better the next time if you choose to fly with us again and offered only 15K air miles which is the equivalent of maybe $150, when I spent 100K air miles for this trip. Their defensive responses to emails were very inaccurate, unprofessional, condescending and overall poor customer service response was a perfect representation of how I was treated on the flights with American. The lack of a caring, empathetic, customer first attitude is rampant in American Airlines.

United Airlines,2.0,T L Wilson,6th May 2015,"I booked our family of (3's) flight months in advance all seats were requested together and I prefer sitting next to the window because it seems to help my severe motion sickness. Per experience I usually allow a 90-120 min layover if I have a connecting flight which if you fly out of Pittsburgh it is almost impossible to get straight through flights unless you fly Southwest where unless you are a bouncer you cannot get a window seat to save your life. The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on 'mechanical delay'. The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight.

During Istanbul to Munich, we did not get our pre-booked seat. Our 5 year old child always wants the window seat and for him we make extra effort to book it.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,5.0,Jurgen Berkeley,17th January 2014,Flew AMS-KL with KLM as I was code sharing with Malaysian Airlines. As I'm Dutch I've flown KLM very frequently for the past 20 years but this was the first time I had a claustrophobic feeling when sitting down. It was a 777-300 and the aisle has been made extremely narrow in these models. The trolley's are constantly bumping into seats all economy passengers are very close to each other and to top it off the high cabin temperature prevented passengers from falling asleep. No-one used blankets which rarely happens. Despite that the Dutch are among the tallest people in the world KLM's seats will never suit us and knees are fixed in the seat in front. My earlier flight from KL to AMS was with an old MH airplane but at least there the seats were wide enough and ample leg space.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,yes
American Airlines,1.0,L Gonzo,6th April 2015,Flew from San Francisco to DFW (Dallas) for my connection into Houston Hobby (04/05/15) just to sit around for hours the airline changed the departure time at least 7 times then in the end it was cancelled and do you think they had the decency to have a ticket agent at the booth no mysteriously the agents all disappeared right before the cancelled notice went up on their board. No one instructed us to do anything I went to other agents and they just told us they could not help. Just ridiculous all around meanwhile Mother's and children traveling alone sitting at the gate crying trying to figure out how they were going to get home. I ended up having to get a rental to make it to my final destination on my own. All American Airlines does is inconvenience people the final straw was when the agents at the rental car counter stated that American does this every week to folks who are going to Houston Austin and Lufkin so it was nothing new to them they claim mechanical failure! If they supposedly have new planes and they are investing in all this new equipment where is it? Why don't they use some of those new so called planes they have purchased!

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Wahid Kouider,11th June 2018,"Not Verified | This flight was delayed by one hour or so, which made me miss subsequent flights Delta 0121 (MSP to HND) and China Eastern 0540 (HND to PVG). This delay caused me to change my subsequent flight to next day which caused a penalty of $1,187.90 that I had to pay to China Eastern. Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG. After calling 2 to 3 times a day, finally I received my luggage 4 days since my original flight. I was on a business trip and my stop at Shanghai was primary for meetings scheduled for Saturday April 28th, due to delay, I missed these meeting and my stop at Shanghai become worthless. I couldnt make up for these meetings since Monday and Tuesday was a Holiday in China and I had to continue my trip to my next stop in Wuhan. The damage caused by this delayed flight and luggage is difficult to quantify beside the cash penalty that I paid ($1,187.90).

Southwest Airlines,1.0,P Dawson,25th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This is the first and last time I fly Southwest. I'm very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. I flew in from Dallas Lovefield to Phoenix Arizona for a business meeting. On my way out of Dallas I found no line. But I did find two female Southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. They were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in, as well as print my boarding pass for me. When it came time to board I was in the B group. That was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. Great since I'm 28-going on 29 weeks pregnant and I may need to get up to use the rest room. I've only flown American and Delta with assigned seats. I hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. I had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. Once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to San Diego I believe. No big deal until the plan begins to get refueled! The fumes were so strong and awful. Fast forward a day, I'm pleased to go home to Dallas, hoping for better luck with my seat this time. Unfortunately my pass says I'm in group C. Even further out from boarding than on my flight in. At our boarding time of 5.15pm we were told that the flight crew for our flight will not even land until 5.45pm, that we may begin boarding at 6.10pm to leave at 6.30pm. This is all a maybe.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Jean Pierre Barbe,25th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | It was my first time flying Turkish Airlines from Geneva to Jakarta via Istanbul. I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff donâ€™t even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it. The seat was acceptable, and the entertainment system good (some other airlines have more choices, but it was good enough for me), I liked the controlller than can be used as a screen, and the headsets.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Randy Diaz,10th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We split our time between France and US. So we fly quite often between the two, and we also travel a lot for leisure. So we decided to use around the world tickets, the advantage being it allows you to make stops, change flight schedules etc. without penalties. Additionally, we opted to go Business class with 1st class flights with the latter being carriers who do not have business class. There is an unspoken expectation that if you upgrade, you will be allowed to use the lounge. Long story short, wrong. We flew from Paris to Detroit. Stopped in Detroit, MI for a few days, then flew to Reno, NV. We were able to use the business lounge in Paris, but not able to use the business lounge in Detroit, stating that we could only use it if we continue on to Reno on the same day. Or basically flying continuously around the world? WTF? I am not trying to be entitled or ask for special treatment, but when you pay for business or first class tickets, there is an expectation that you can use the lounges. So I tweeted to Delta and they asked me to PM them with my complaint/feedback. Response I got, itâ€™s basically their policy, and theyâ€™re not making exceptions. Again, I was not asking for special treatment nor do I feel as though I am entitled, but there is an expectation when you pay 3-times that of economy. I write this to let otherâ€™s know, because you have choices for around the world tickets. I like flying business because, call it paranoia, but I like being at the airport early so as not to miss my flight, and having the comfort of these lounges. Delta really needs to look at their â€œaround the world policyâ€ as it relates to usage of their lounge. This is the response I got from Delta. â€œThanks for your patience, Randy. I have further reviewed policies and we strongly enforce these guidelines. Please know we regret the disappointment as we value your business and choice of airline. Applying for the Delta American Express Card or buying a Membership is also another option.

Emirates,5.0,D Thomas,23rd December 2013,"Bangkok to Sydney. Have previously flown this leg 6 times with a well-known Thai based airline. As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Helge Reitz,4th January 2016,"After snow fall on New Years Eve, on Jan 1st we checked prior driving to the airport the airport departure information and found no information on delays or any problems whatsoever. We then drove through beautiful weather to the airport. There we found total chaos: About 20 to 30 flights had been cancelled. At 11.00 our flight (TK0786 to Tel Aviv at 12.20) was marked as cancelled too, almost all other flights where delayed. The Turkish Airline transfer desk had kilometer-long lines, and after waiting and pushing for many hours, all they did there was copy passports. Then we were sent to the ticket counter, again km long lines. We did finally arrive in Tel Aviv with 11 hours delay. But our luggage had been lost. Now, 3 days later, still no news about our luggage. And guess what, the service number of Turkish Airlines in Tel Aviv is engaged constantly. Durning the 10 hours of queing and being pushed around there was no anouncement of appology, no public appeal through the intercom system, no drinks were offered, no assistance to disabled people was arranged, no special treatment for families with pregnant woman or little children was offered. Turkish Airlines did not seem to make any effort whatsoever to put some substance to their solgan ""we are the most popular airline"". They let their own few staff members who were trying to handle the situation down badly. They had to stand on the table tops and shout into the crowd all day to prevent being squashed by the thousands of people. And now, on Jan 4th in the afternoon our luggage has still not arrived.

Emirates,1.0,B Freeman,8th October 2014,I neither would fly Emirates again nor recommend them. They position themselves as a high end service but are actually low cost/low service. We just flew Rome to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok. The Dubai to Sydney sector was an old 777 with 10 abreast seating (3-4-3). The 777 was designed for 9 abreast seating but EK has added an extra seat in the middle. The cabin is like a sardine can. The service was amateur. The entertainment system average. A horrid flight and experience. EK positions itself against Singapore Cathay Qantas and the like. However it really is a third rate airline. Never again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

I know this time it was to try to get home a little earlier. I seem to always regret it. This time I gate checked my bag to have it left on the tarmac. When I saw it, the employees would not give it to me saying that they could not give it to us because they didn't ""know"" that it was mine. Never mind that I could identify the bag and its contents!! Instead, we had to leave the terminal and claim it at baggage claim (how do they know it is my bag there when they have ripped off the tag) and then go back through TSA (always fun) to try to make my connection. The last time I flew Delta they wanted my 5 year old son to sit 10 rows away from me. Thanks to a kind fellow travelers, we were able to sit together.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Usman Gul Mohammed,13th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Medina to Istanbul via Doha. Our flight was overbooked from Medina when we got to the airport. We were told that only 3 of the 6 passengers could board the flight. We had a layover in Doha for a day so the connection time wasn't an issue. The check in staff told us that we came late to check in but then we argued that it doesn't mean that you can check in 3 passengers and can't check in the other 3 as we all came at the same time. Then they told us the truth that the flight was overbooked after 20 minutes and they said the next 3 flights are fully booked. So 3 of the passengers boarded the flight and the other 3 including me stayed at Madina airport. The Qatar airways manager was very calm and helpful. He put us on the next flight which was in 4 hours, gave us free lounge access and gave us compensation more that what we bought the ticket for. The flight from Medina to Doha was pleasant, food was nice, atmosphere was calm, and there was good in flight entertainment. The second flight to Istanbul was even better with more of a choice of food, inflight entertainment, and WiFi onboard which was working well.

It really can't be that hard to handle some fins, a mask and a very small speargun for no charge can it, especially when these make up the only form of checked in baggage? And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either. Oh and they don't charge sports baggage fees as a single trip return, they charge for each destination where you stop / layover, both there and back, so you could pay up to 90 euros one way,and the same return.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul,July 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,7.0,Neil Snee,12th April 2015,LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very.

Air Canada,1.0,D Cain,23rd November 2017,âœ… Trip Verified | Booked Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver for December. My complaint is the manner in which Air Canada has increased the price of their fares by offering reduced seat fares through travel web sites (e.g. Expedia) only to underhandedly force the purchaser to pay for selecting a seat either before or during check-in and paying for every piece of luggage. This practice is deceiving and dishonest. I have come to appreciate airlines who are forthright in their pricing practices through travel web sites and have flown many that are completely above board. It is unfortunate that we are serviced by so few airlines in Canada that this type of price gouging is allowed to continue.

United Airlines,1.0,Alex Ross,26th January 2015,I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program.

I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United.

When I went to do my online check-in on the Alitalia website, my fare class was written as ""Economy"" not ""Light"", suggesting that I had a checked bag included. In fact, when I went into the section to purchase checked baggage, the website was charging me 60 euro (as if I were looking to have a second bag) instead of 25 euro (which is supposed to be the price for adding a bag online, in advance, on the Alitalia website, when you have a ""Light"" fare). On the basis of this information that I checked and double-checked on the Alitalia website itself, I did not do a checked baggage advanced purchase. When I arrived at the terminal, I was advised that I was not allowed checked baggage without paying. I had taken screenshots of the check-in for the website and I showed them to the incredibly rude customer service representative, to no avail. I had to pay 48 euro at Palermo airport. They kept asking me over and over why I hadn't paid for the bag online - I tried multiple times to explain how the website was charging me 60 euro (even less than the airport cost), so why would I ever have paid that online. I note that the same thing regarding the website check-in and baggage cost happened on both my inbound and outbound flights on this same ticket. The ticket was listed on the Alitalia website itself as ""Economy"" fare, not light. I sent a complaint to Alitalia by e-mail (you can only e-mail with complaints from Canada, no telephone number) a month ago and have received no response. All I'm asking for is a refund of the difference between the airport price and online price for baggage. I'm happy to pay for the baggage, but should not be more out of pocket because Alitalia's website is useless and the counter staff lack any understanding of the online check-in process.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Palermo to Rome,June 2017,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

My seat did not recline and my flight was LA to Sydney it means 15 hours flying in the same position. The seat was near the back of the plane where the flight attendants stay during the flight. They wouldn't close the curtains so it was always with lights on and I could hear them talking and laughing for 15 hours. It was my worst nightmare and I do not recommend Delta to anyone.

First flight (CPT-DOH) on a new 787 I was very excited for my first flight on a Dreamliner but was rather disappointed by the poor seat pitch and width being 1.9m tall (6'2) I was very uncomfortable and unable to sleep the whole way. The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,Geoffrey Townsend,12th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Southampton to Strasbourg via Amsterdam. I chose to fly with KLM via AMS, with the return journey via CDG - by TGV train to CDG and onward with Flybe (Air France flight number). I made my booking with Expedia. Basically, everything was fine. The flights via Amsterdam were fine but the connection time was a bit tight because of passport control. The return journey was fine - Strasbourg station check-in was excellent, as was the TGV - I shall definitely consider TGV connections via CDG again. However, FlyBE is an experience I do without. Late. Appalling on board catering which they have the cheek to charge for. The flights to AMS and Strasbourg offered acceptable food and drink for free and the service was very correct. What did surprise me was the 40 Euro per checked bag fee in each direction. The Expedia site did not give a warning of this and it was not clear from the ticketing documentation - it came as a surprise at check-in.I hace flown a couple of thousand times and consider myself a seasoned traveller, I know that such fees are common with budget airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet and some US domestic airlines, but I have never experienced this with established airlines like KLM or AF, I normally fly Star Alliance (LH, TK, LX) or Aeroflot. So I was unpleasantly surprised. This represented a hidden charge of ca 30%, and it was not at all clear in the booking process. It would probably not have changed my airline choice or route planning, nut I would have liked to know in advance. The Southampton experience was good (particularly on the return - the train connection is outstanding, but the departure lounge somewhat dismal). I live in West Dorset, so it is great to have a hassle free airport as an alternative to LHR or LGW.

Emirates,2.0,I Jumbe,6th April 2015,I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about. Incredibly disappointed. The massive gulf in quality between the Europe-originating route and the Africa-bound one was massive. Unforgivably so given the fact that we were still expected to pay a premium. Poor showing Emirates.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,2.0,no

I was given no vouchers for food or anything else, was given minimal assistance, just a slip of paper and ""hope they have room for you on the next one"".

It has failed to work for me several times now. Your are required to pay an advance fee, which is supposed to get you a check in spot prior to the 24 hour advance check in. Instead, when checking in after the 24 hour time frame, you are assigned the next boarding place, which by then is far back in line. Better to just skip the fee and log in exactly 24 hours ahead, which we all know is a real pain. And if you try to get customer service to respond, be prepared for a 20 min hold on the phone, followed by a representative who could not care less.

The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice.

You can't recline the seat more than an inch. There was an entertainment system that required you to have your own tablet but when you went to the app there were no first rum movies. My initial flight was on a different type of plane so my original seats didn't match up and my husband and I had someone sitting between us.

On the way to Narita we were both stuck with the Japanese meal being at the back of the plane. Was awful. On the return flight back we managed to get seats in the front of the plane and had a much better meal. Still 1 out of 2 inflight systems did not work properly only a couple of movies worked.

American Airlines,2.0,Fred Davidson,23rd April 2015,"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again.

I was flying from Boston MA to Atlanta Georgia via Newark with the flight scheduled 7:30 am with destination arrival 1:18 pm. The flight from the Boston was delayed for more than 5 hours due to thunder storm at Newark and the problem with generator failure at the gate which caused missing of connecting flight to Atlanta. After waiting in queue for 2 hrs at Newark, the boarding pass was issued for 5:40 pm that day(August 11th, Saturday). After the boarding was announced for 5:40 and the gate was opened for crew members, the plane was cancelled. There was already very long queue at consumer service there were no other options than standing in the queue because I was unable to reach customer service via phone. After waiting for line for more than four hours, the situation became very worse due to rude behavior of the customer service representative. She mentioned that next available flight is on Monday morning(August 13th) and there is nothing she can do to help. She also mentioned that hotel accommodation cannot be done as it is weather related although the flight delay from Boston was due to power failure at the gate as well. She convinced me to fly back to Boston next morning(Sunday) and forget about the family vacation or wait at airport until Monday morning. The representative walked away stating that she has other customer to take care of and asking me to make decision to wait until Monday or fly back to Boston on Sunday. It was already past 10 PM and my younger daughter(5yrs) was sleeping on my shoulder. The customer service representative did not came back to the window for more that half and hour and I walked to the next window and requested to talk to the manager. The guy at other window called their team leader who offered option for stand by tickets for next day and spend the night at the airport. I was already tired and hungry and there was no other option than crying or comforting wife and two kids. Spent cold night at cold airport floor. I was not able to get accommodated on 9 am flight on Sunday. I convinced my wife and two kids who where crying after loosing hope of getting flight. Next available flight for stand by was on 11:01 am. There was already about 60 people on standby list and I was flying in a family of four, so the hope of getting boarding pass was very minimum.

United Airlines,6.0,W Cole,17th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Sao Paulo. I fly United a lot, because I live in Chicago and have the opportunity to collect miles and other benefits. Generally, I've been satisfied with this arrangement. I'm not unrealistic about United - you definitely don't get the small luxuries that Asian and some European airlines provide, but United generally provides competent, reliable service, and most staff members are reasonably friendly. Recent flights to and from GRU were par for the course. The flights were on time. Staff were efficient. The economy plus seats were fine. The small screens on the 767s are pretty bad, but I understand why it might not be worth updating them. I don't eat meat and have learned that ""Asian vegetarian"" tends to be better quality than regular vegetarian. The ""Asian vegetarian"" suppers were reasonable in both directions, although there was nothing at all Asian about the GRU to ORD supper (soy burgers plus rice and vegetables). The ORD to GRU supper was quite good and (except maybe for the curried tofu) quite South Asian. It even came with plain yogurt. However, United should be embarrassed by the breakfasts (in both directions), which consisted entirely of a stale roll and a tiny package of jam. People who didn't request a special meal got a croissant and a sweetened yogurt, which would have been just as ""Asian vegetarian"" as what I did get. My seatmate who (unlike me) is actually South Asian was just furious. This is the sort of thing that undermines United's improving reputation. Asian and most European airlines are much more generous about breakfasts and usually provide vegetarians (and everyone else) with a full meal. Let me add that I complained about the breakfast on the GRU to ORD flight to an FA as gently as I could, and she very nicely supplied me with a regular breakfast. I urged my seatmate to do the same, and he just got angrier.

Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours. We sure could have used those lay-flat beds for the over-ocean portion. We've avoided United for several years now and from now on will continue to avoid them.,,,First Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

We were given little info other than plane broken and a new one coming from Athens. When the new plane arrived the ground staff and gate were disorganized making the delay even longer. During this extreme delay we were given snacks and water. Once arriving into Athens and missing my flight to JMK a ticket agent helped us and put us on a departure getting us in only a few hours late on Olympic. I emailed Aegean three times to enquire about a refund or another ticket (As we were instructed to do both in MXP and ATH) and it took two emails to get a response.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,,Martin Webber,22nd October 2014,Having booked a series of long-haul Business Class flights with KLM I searched their website and their Terms and Conditions just to make sure that in line with all other airlines they allow the inflight use of CPAP machines (CPAP = Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - a small air pump that prevents sleep apnoea). As they provide power sockets to their long-haul Business Class seats I assumed that this would be no problem but believe it or not KLM will not allow passengers to connect medical equipment to their power sockets! KLM allow passengers to connect anything else to their power sockets (computers tablets DVD players phone chargers electric razors etc) but not medical equipment. I have told KLM that my little CPAP machine is electrically tested and internationally certified for aircraft use - but still they say no. When asked why they refuse to answer.

The one hour flight to Amsterdam was with KLM Cityhopper on an Embraer 190. The crew were attentive and jolly and the meal a salad was excellent. The connection at Amsterdam was easy and despite being just over one hour was not a rushed one. On board the Boeing 747-400 I was seated in 1A (a seat by itself). The Purser and crew in this cabin were excellent and I truly was pampered.

American Airlines,,S Dharmasena,19th January 2015,JFK-SFO-LAX-LAS-JFK with American Airlines were the worst four flights of my life! Ground staff and cabin crew were rude and inefficient. The cabin and seats were very old and worn out. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. I will never fly with AA again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience. The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us. Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope.

The service is the part which is most disappointing: its unfriendly, after dinner they disappear and its really up to you to get any drink or food or about 3-4 hour when they appear again to get ready for landing.

The difference between the two service staff was marked - this is the second time this has happened. The meals on Emirates in Economy have deteriorated in the last year or so, probably because Emirates operates a codeshare arrangement with Qantas on this route, so they are maybe catering to Qantas customers. The cabin staff are very professional and helpful, The beer on board is supermarket class offering a Dutch and USA option with a Dutch light alternative rather than options from Oceania or Asia which I would prefer, still the staff offer options rather than just what is close to hand. The wine is quite reasonable given it is cool and drunk at altitude. The in-flight entertainment is superior unless the person in front insists on fully reclining their seat even during meals which makes viewing the screen extremely unpleasant, but this is probably more a reflection on the type of passenger Emirates attracts with their code share arrangement with Qantas than on the actual seat.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Bangkok,July 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,yes

It was freezing cold in Vermont, I did not have my luggage or any change of clothes. I had work in the morning and was notified that my luggage would arrive by 10am. My luggage did not get delivered to my hotel until 5pm the next day, which surpassed the 6hour. The company did not compensate my loss with anything. No extra miles, ride to my hotel, or anything to help me get through the freezing cold weather. By the time I found news of my luggage, everything was closed already. If I didn't already have an account with Delta or if the flights to Vermont was limited, I would definitely choose another Airline.

American Airlines,1.0,Rose Resuena,28th December 2018,"Not Verified | Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. We visited LA for Christmas. We were scheduled to fly back to Dallas 12/26/18 at 7:45. I was to check in online for that flight and received our boarding passes through email. After we returned our rental car, I then received a text message that our flight back to Dallas has been cancelled. We headed to the airport and out flight was rebooked for later that night 10:30pm LA to Reno then to Dallas. My husband had to miss work. We had to ride the bus going to our assigned gate, as soom as we arrived at the gate I received another text message that Reno to Dallas flight has been cancelled. We approached the staff and they told us to go back to ticketing counter to get our flights rebooked as there is nompoint for us flying to Reno if our final flight to Dallas is cancelled. We stood in line for quite sometime to get our flights rebooked. So our flight got rebooked again to depart evening the following day. We asked if a hotel will be provided, they said no hotel because it is cancelled due to weather. We had to pay extra for our hotel. We also had 1 checked baggage and we were told to go to baggage claim area to get it. When we got there they told us they canâ€™t locate our bag, that it might be being loaded going to Reno. Staff advised us to come back at 5:30am and said since our flight from Reno to Dallas has been cancelled they will send the bag back to LA. All our clothes and toiletries are in out checked baggage. We came back the following day and another staff said it would be a miracle if out bag will be sent back to LA, when she checked the status it said that it is headed to Dallas from Reno. Now we are here at airport, our flight back to Dallas is supposed to depart at 5:59pm 12/27/18. Few minutes after we arrived on the assigned gate, I received a text that our flight is delayed amd will be departing at 7:50pm! The delay Is not about the weather this time.

From their seats, to their ticketing process and flight attendants. First of all, they didn't let us purchase an upgrade to business class although the class was half empty. We paid $189 a seat for ""premium"", which was the biggest joke. The seat barely reclined. I've never ever been so uncomfortable during a flight. I couldn't lift up the armrests between me and my kids, the seats barely reclined and when they did, they wouldn't stay, and the width was smaller than normal.

After dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in Dubai, we landed back in Dubai at 9.00pm. Then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a Hotel. It was taking for ever. After collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. It was utter chaos, children were crying, there were a lot of very tired passengers. Finally after a very long time and the Management woke up to the crisis, they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers, which we took up. I am totally shocked at the Emirates response to this incident. No regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. They had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the Hotels and transport for the passengers. Yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude.

We did not expect a total sell out of meals. We had a choice of a few snack items such as chocolate bar chips twizzlers and nuts. According to staff they sold out after 1st class and had to even sell off staff meals.

On the Boeing 767-300 it is a 1-2-1 staggered layout. However, the shell of each seat is way too short, creating a less private experience. The catering service was great. Three entree options were provided and were accompanied by an appetizer, a salad, a soup, and some deserts afterwards. Delta uses Westin's Heavenly bedding onboard all of their Delta One flights which was very comfortable. However, the poor design of the seat caused the situation where there was no room for my feet to move when the seat is in its lie-flat position. The flight crew was very friendly.

United Airlines,1.0,Ihtsham Nissar,12th November 2014,I have been flying United for the past 6 years from MAN to EWR and to my dismay it is a total and utter shambles. Within those 6 years I have flown as a solo passenger whilst being pregnant and then with an infant and later with a toddler. I would not recommend them to a single traveler let alone a pregnant one. The only reason we continued to use this airline was due to the fact that EWR has the most quickest and convenient route home. Apart from that there is nothing that is appealing about the airline. The seats are not the slightest bit comfortable however you are able to slightly move them back to a tilt. I can disregard the seating as almost all airlines are the same but the cabin crew were obnoxious rude and definitely did not seem to enjoy their job. Asking for juice was definitely a chore for them. Next time I will not be flying United too many years of bad experiences.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Amsterdam,March 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no

So, they made me to stay at airport for 12 hours, without any accommodation. They technically treated me like a baggage. The day after this experience, I decided to contact AA to fill a complain and ask them for refund or something.

Unfortunately, the boarding of on this flight was denied in Doha due to payload problems (July 9th 2016). Since the next flight was 24hr later, we were offered by Qatar airways and compensation of 250USD. To claim the 250 USD we had to go Dar Es Salaam to the Qatar office. Unfortunately, there was no office at the airport for arriving passengers. We couldn't go to the departure hall since we had no valid ticket to leave Dar Es Salaam. In Zanzibar airport, the office was closed. Back in Qatar, they said at the transit office that we should go to Brussels and claim it there, and Brussels they told us that we should have claimed the money in Doha.

The check in was courteous when I asked for my luggage to be tagged as fragile. Boarding was swift. My only complaint at this point in time is the lack of lounge in Adelaide, and we had the share the domestic Qantas lounge which was accessible prior to immigration and custom check. That means that I have very little lounge time. Once boarded the plane, welcome drink was served. Personal introduction by the chief purser of the cabin. Whilst evening meal was offered, we were also offered the option of having breakfast or not being woken up. I chose to have breakfast as it was a long flight of 12 hrs to Dubai. The aircraft departed on time. Hot nuts and a second drink was served prior before the main meal. The options and portions were generous. The food choices were tasty. The seats were comfortable, and better with a soft comforter. The IFE choices were great with latest movies available. There was a separate tablet console which made navigation through their IFE system easier. Time passed very quickly and after breakfast, we soon landed.

Air New Zealand,2.0,Graeme Kerr,5th June 2013,After booking a flight from Christchurch to London via Hong Kong last year and being a long term Koru member we received what I can only describe as very 3rd class attention. Our flight from Hong Kong to London was cancelled after ANZ dropped this route as being unprofitable prior to March this year (travelled in May). We had to make other arrangements as LA was not an option for us. The alternative offered was Cathay Pacific who provided a truly super service. However one of the reasons my wife and I choose ANZ internationally was to be able to use the lounge facilities in Hong Kong going out and in London Heathrow and Hong Kong returning. It just makes the 22 hour flight more bearable. However during the dropping of the London - Hong Kong sector ANZ have made no alternative lounge facilities through any other airline and the code share at Hong Kong does not allow a guest since March this year. I understand the need to rationalise flight sectors but the poor way ANZ staff handled the change in my case is very disappointing and not worthy of a so called 4 star airline. Our Next international flights will be with another carrier some who offer complimentary lounge facilities and a genuine customer care attitude as a given.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,no

No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger.

United Airlines,1.0,Analise Fagan,8th August 2014,I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late.

The Delta Hub in Atlanta said they would send a plane, then after 3 hours of waiting, the pilot received word that it had not even taken off. When the 'rescue plane' finally arrived after everyone (260 approx) being in the plane for 8 hours, we sat on the rescue plane for another 50 minutes until we finally took off at 12.10am. I arrived at Newark to find my bag had been sent to Atlanta. Because of all of this I missed a connecting flight. I write this from Newark airport, still not reaching my destination of LA. This is not the first time I have had an issue with Delta.",,Business,Economy Class,Clermont-Ferrand to Newark via Paris,August 2015,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,1.0,G Larkins,11th August 2014,Delta did not notify me of flight cancellation of a direct flight from PHX to JFK airport that was to leave at 8.30 which had been changed previously from 9.30 until we had arrived at the terminal. Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off. We should have been treated more courteously and not like a herd of cattle especially as a 1st class ticket holder. We paid for more!,,,First Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,D Marriott,27th March 2014,Overall an enjoyable experience. Flying BHX-AMS-IAD and cabin crew were delightful and attentive. Food was good and drinks were served regularly. Flying IAD-AMS-BHX was good and bad in some respects. Much more room to relax as the flight was only about 1/3 full but felt slightly neglected by crew and had to ask for refreshments rather than have them brought to me regularly (perhaps because it was a red eye flight? who knows). Crew also somewhat less enthusiastic on this return but not rude or unprofessional.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes
Emirates,3.0,Paul Bolton,19th September 2014,I've flown Emirates over a period of ten years and I can comprehensively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Emirates pitch themselves as being a top-top airline and to a degree the service they offer on paper is quite comprehensive. Their route network is very good and their fares at times can be competitive however the last four long haul flights I've taken with Emirates progressively gets worse. The cabin staff seem disinterested in providing a first class service to the nonchalant ground staff in Dubai. They are cutting back massively on quality they've stopped handing out comfort packs for flights the food is getting worse and the cabin crew don't respond to calls made from your chair. I can give quite a few examples of bad service travelling with Emirates over the last few trips however it was compounded by a poor experience travelling with an infant recently. I've always looked forward to flying with Emirates and I have quite a few Tier Miles and Skywards miles however I feel I've flown my last flight with Emirates.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,,3.0,no

When clearing trays, he dropped two dirty utensils, one hit my leg, and never said a word. He then proceeded to kick the two dirty forks under someone's seat! At the conclusion of the flight, there was no effort to clean up. I'm used to flight attendants coming through collecting newspapers, stray cups etc. this was a sold out flight, five hours in duration, so you'd expect some effort to keep the cabin clean for customers.

All I got for the trouble caused by United Airline is a sorry from the representative and a $7 meal voucher - very good customer care indeed. Request to adjust seat told the plane is 100% full. Okay so I request to adjust seat in advance for my return flight now this is where it gets interesting: I was told by the desk representative that their ""system"" will not let her do so and was advised to use United Airline website to adjust seat myself the only problem is their website does not have the seat change option either.

Arrived Sydney early and told I couldn't change my flight to an earlier departure that was still open for check in. Tried to check in using the automated machines only to have my passport literally snatched out of my hand and taken to the manual check booth. Intervention was not required or appreciated. Seat on A320 is quite cramped and I only had a carry on baggage ticket so had to order a snack via the app. Entertainment options OK and easy to use.

How is it we are now spending more and more money these days, yet going through hoops just to fly and getting less?

United Airlines,3.0,N Burkoski,13th October 2014,Travelled on a connecting flight from Toronto to Houston TX en route to Rio de Janeiro. Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,no

United Airlines,9.0,G Reader,27th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I encountered excellent customer service from the United staff on the flight from Salt Lake City to Houston, and from Houston to New Orleans. Flight 1718 was delayed by air traffic control for an hour, which meant an extremely tight, in fact, impossible layover in Houston [7 minutes]. The gate agent [Gate B7 at SLC] got me a reservation on the first flight out the following day as the flight from Houston to New Orleans was the last of the day. The agents kept us up to date and were optimistic that time would be made up and the outbound flight held a few minutes to accommodate enroute passengers. Apparently, meals for first class were not delivered on the previous flight and the gate agent ran down to buy 8 meals to make sure we got fed. The United staff did an excellent job in hurrying boarding and making sure those with tight connections had a good shot at making the next flight. It all worked out! I made the flight to New Orleans. Not surprisingly, the checked bag didn't make it, but it was delivered to my door two days later, at an address 120 miles from New Orleans.

Lufthansa,5.0,Richard Winger,6th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Berlin in business class. Flights were fine. Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted â€œthere is no precheckâ€ and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse.

Air Canada,2.0,H Cram,14th April 2016,âœ… Verified Review | London Heathrow to Calgary. Everything that is said by reviewers about the 3x3x3 seat configuration in economy class on the Boeing 787 is true. The seats are far too narrow for comfortable travel. I am an Air Canada frequent flyer and had the front row of economy class on the aisle - travelling with family instead of business for a change. Apart from having to deal with the very cramped middle seat person I was regularly bumped by the FAs and their trolley throughout the flight due to the very narrow aisles. I would rather fly on an older Boeing 777 or A330 then have to suffer this again. To cap it all off the FA gave me a cracked cup which leaked all over my lap.

United Airlines,1.0,Hendrix Andrew,11th January 2015,I used United in the past for domestic flights in the US and it was average I thought it would be fine to use them to travel abroad. Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price.

Emirates,7.0,T Iversen,16th May 2014,ARN-AKL via DXB and SYD in Business. Very comfortable lounge in ARN. Clean aircraft ARN-DXB with attentive and pleasant FAs but come across as a bit inexperienced. Slow drink service during dinner and food ok but not great. The Business seat a bit cramped for my taste. Had the Dubai connect service at DXB (because of a long lay-over the airline puts you up in a hotel arranges transport and visa for you) and that was great. Nice to have a good bed for the night in an excellent hotel. Immigration into and out of Dubai very quick. Lounge in DXB was excellent (have a hard time understanding all the negative reviews about this - but admittedly did not use washrooms or showers. Food was great). Flight from DXB to AKL via SYD in 380. Excellent seat. Again very pleasant FAs but again somewhat inexperienced appearing. Again very slow drink service. Was given a before dinner drink. Then no drink with the starter but with the assurance that it was coming. It came when the starter was finished. Then the main meal arrived but no drink. That came after the meal was finished. Those things are not the end of the world but it comes across as somewhat unprofessional. Lounge in SYD was fine with nice shower and flight from SYD to AKL had a new crew that seemed more experienced. Overall though I was pleased especially considering the cost was significantly lower than on competing airlines.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,T Gautam,1st September 2015,"The trouble started at SIN itself when our onward journey from IST to LIS was cancelled without notification. Upon inquiring at the airport, we were told that the cancellation was a mistake and that the sector would be reinstated. Once the reinstatement happened, we got our boarding passes. Looking at the trouble that we had, I asked the Turkish Airlines staff to reconfirm our return flight from IST to SIN and we were even allotted seats 16 A/B. The leg space in A330 is poor and I have never ever experienced such uncomfortable seats. The seating in Boeing 737 is more normal and I did not have any issues from IST to LIS. On our way back, IST airport was chaotic. People were not maintaining the queues and check-in was the most unruly I have encountered. Once we reached the counter we were informed that the flight is full. I told the agent that it is good for TK and I just want my boarding pass. I got the boarding pass after some reluctance on the agents part. I did not give it much importance but as soon as we moved from the counter, I saw STB on our seat allocation. I went back and inquired and was informed that we have been put on Standby. Even after informing the agent that I have confirmed seats, she said that she is unable to help me and that I would be helped at the gate. At the gate, the agents told us that a supervisor is going to come to help us out. However for the entire boarding time, no one came and only when we started to get agitated did someone come. There were approx 9 passengers who were on standby and the supervisor let 2 of them board. Then they allowed my wife to board and I was told that there is no more spare seat. I was angry and credit to the supervisor, he was professional and sent his assistant to physically check inside the aircraft and they found an empty seat which was allocated to me.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,T Eldem,5th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively quick and efficient. Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library.

The seat back monitors allowed you to order drinks right then and there. The drinks are free, and although the food is not, the prices are very reasonable. Seats are comfortable, as for leg room, I am only 5'8"" so I don't really have problems with leg room, but from the looks of it, somebody of average height would have a good amount of leg room. The ground crew were nice and the check-in was smooth and fast. The only remotely negative things about Virgin America are that the remotes are a bit challenging to use (just me being picky) and that it is more expensive than most airlines for a transcontinental, domestic flight.

Both my flights (BOS-LGA delayed from 7pm to 8:30pm and LGA-CHO delayed from 9 pm to 11 pm) were delayed by couple of hours which was fine and understood - but just 30 mins before my 2nd flight (at 8:30 for LGA-CHO) they emailed me that the 2nd leg of the flight will be on time and the first flight won't reach on time for me to even think about rushing and getting to gate to try to make it. Cherry on the cake they did not even wait for few passengers going to CHO and said you are scheduled for next afternoon now via Atlanta - so basically by the time I reach my final destination it will be 7pm of next day.

Pleased to see that there is a business class lounge in Yangon, shared with other airlines, as this is not mentioned on Emirates website. The lounge was very comfortable though with very limited food post-midnight. The cabin crew were very helpful on both legs of the journey and provided much better service on both legs than on recent trips. In particular, they accommodated a small bamboo stool (souvenir) that was marginally over the luggage dimensions though fitted OK into the larger overhead lockers (ground staff wanted to put it in the hold). They also greeted me by name on the DXB-MAN flight and offered to show me how all the seat / screen controls worked. The seats were very comfy on both the new Boeing 777 (RGN-DXB) and the older A380 (DXB-MAN). I asked to change my breakfast from Express to Continental and the cabin crew agreed immediately. The food is never exceptional on Emirates but it was tasty. The New Zealand Pinot Noir wine was excellent. The cabin crew were very attentive in bringing and removing towels / food and drink.

No IFE supplied and no refreshments purchased but then again they are only short flights. But this time having booked our flights we were offered Economy Plus seats when we came to choose our seats for $28 each per flight. We duly chose this option and paid only for the aircraft on the outward flight to be changed. The replacement aircraft had no Economy Plus seats - no refund came until I chased this through there refund system. Worse still the return flight was on the original aircraft which never had Economy Plus seats in the first place.

Emirates,1.0,L Salter,12th March 2016,"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from.

When I was looking for round trips from Beijing to Denver and vice versa, this was one of the cheapest flights I came across, even cheaper than the US airlines, and it did not disappoint! With comfortable seats, a nice selection of the latest movies and TV shows, and decent airline food, I would pick this over airlines like United Airlines any day. Also, the plane did an amazing and efficient job at letting the passengers out the plane. The only complaints I had were rather minor, one being that whenever the crew announced something, they would do it in 3 different languages, meaning you had to wait 3 times as long for your movie to play again, and also Canada's inefficient system of transferring layovers for people going to the US.

As a frequent flyer I knew not to expect too much of their Boeing 767-300 product. The domestic 767's are ancient, nothing has been done to the Y cabin since early 1990's. The seats are worn, uncomfortable and lacks IFE. Cabin panels are so old that they're turning yellow and everything on this plane was dirty. The safety video wouldn't play because the old aisle CRT-screens in Y wouldn't even turn on. Tray table was dirty and covered in food residue. Reading light did not work, so I was left with nothing to do for 8+ hours as again, there is no in seat IFE. American also has the nerve to charge you for headphones. Good thing I brought my own, but no, since the headphone jack wasn't working either. The only good thing about this flight was the very friendly and personal captain, who came out into the boarding area of the airport to great us with a warm welcome and some information regarding the tropical storm Darby as it would delay our flight. This captain also kept us well informed throughout the flight. Rest of flight crew was disinterested at best, which is understandable given the poor hard product they have to make do with.

From arrival to departure everthing to negotiate is very easy and it is for sure one of most favourite airports. However, the business class lounge is really in the dark ages.

On another tray with a sign that says no pork, there is another tray of small rolls with cheese and stuff etc. It was lunch time when we went in and I was hungry having had a 4 hour journey to get to the airport. A tray of danish pasties appeared from the kitchen, at lunch time. On another counter there were plastic bowls of pasta salad. Just pasta with a dollop of cesar dressing.

By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay. Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat. What was especially good was the standard of catering and the fact the the meal was served so quickly.

Hopefully this was a one-off less pleasant experience. We left with KLM from Brussels to Amsterdam Schiphol to switch to another KLM flight to Bangkok. At our first flight was already wrong: technical problem with the brakes, impossible to leave. After an hour delay we left, and we find out onboard the plane that just connections after 18h (we left at 17:45) were possible. We finally came to Amsterdam to 17h15, where we walked fast with the whole family (traveling with two children) to be told at the gate that we were rebooked via Kuala Lumpur. First of all, we have never asked this but eventually I assume KLM does this only with good intentions. Yet when we were at the gate with children and luggage, the plane was still there, and more people were still boarding and we were not allowed on the plane! KLM decided us to book via Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok, adding a lot of time to our booked journey. The reaction of the staff on the spot was not friendly at all. Eventually, we have to abide by their decision, we were not allowed on the flight, so we went back to the KLM information counter. There they confirmed we had an extra few hours waiting to catch the flight to Kuala Lumpur. When you take such a long journey with children and you book in advance your seats on the plane, we then discovered that we could not sit together as a group of 4, but the staff was able to keep us places 2-2 adjacant in the middle row with 4 seats and 2 seats next to us free so that we would have more space . How do you explain to me that we cannot sit side by side with 4 seats, but with two and two empty seats?Leaving Kuala Lumpur again a technical fault with our plane to Bangkok, again more than 30min delay. Finally arrived in Bangkok over 8hrs later than planned. Booked taxi had gone, extra costs, and less travel enjoyment. Once at home we reported in writing to KLM, who provided an immediate apology and compensation to help mitigate the negative experience.

Emirates,3.0,J Garhan,3rd August 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai. Food service on flight from Los Angeles to Dubai and return was one meal in second hour of flight and one pizza slice 2 hours before landing. This is what we were served on a 16 hour flight - they served soft drinks/juice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. Alcohol/wine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. The Dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. There were approx 120 seats near the gate. They are using A380-800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. The number of seats were totally inadequate. The staff serves food and drinks - but when you ask for something they dont have like Diet Coke/Diet Pepsi they say 'sir I have apple juice/orange juice' - They want passenger to believe they do not have Diet coke/diet pepsi. They are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. Movies/TV shows were in large quantity but lacked quality. The staff do not clean the toilets on a 16 hour flight.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,M Basi,10th September 2014,Booked Business Class BHX to DEL via IST. Business Class Service on the BHX to IST very hit and miss. Steward seemed nervous took my order for drink and forgot to bring me the drink. Later on during the flight the FA took my order for a drink and this one came. Flight attendant serving drinks without bringing them on a serving tray certainly shows me that the Turkish Airways staff need training and overall the service in business class was poor. The lounge at Istanbul is very good. Istanbul to Delhi boarding a shambles. No segregation between Business Class and Economy on boarding especially if you have to travel to the plane by bus. IST TO DEL - one of the most uncomfortable business class seats in the air. I travelled on 22/8/2014. I am going to travel in Business Class on the same route BHX to DEL VIA IST on October and I am hoping for better service.

American Airlines,1.0,Christy Hoss,26th January 2015,"Flight 287. Our Flight was supposed to be non-stop from Miami to LA. Plane developed a problem as we sat waiting to leave the terminal. It took 2 hours to determine it was not fixable. We were compensated with headsets and two granola bars while we waited for the news that American Airlines was trying to find another plane. No plane was available so we deplaned and waited another hour in the terminal for the decision to fly to Phoenix where we could refuel on the same plane and go on to LA. By now the flight is 4 hours late leaving. Arriving in Phoenix the captain said ""Good news is we are in Phoenix the bad news is the crew has to stand down due to FAA regulations."" Another delay - All the passengers were shuttled around to other flights. It's late we are all exhausted and had been lead along by a string of lies. We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets. One lie leads to another creating distress for the passengers and the consequent employees that had to deal with the avalanche that resulted from a full-flight of unhappy flyers. It was a nightmare.

But, Turkish wins hands down in terms of bad experience. I dare say even budget airlines are better. Turkish Airlines delayed the first flight from Dubrovnik to Istanbul by an hour which means thereâ€™s a high possibility of missing my connecting flight. When I arrived in Istanbul, earlier flights are listed on the board showing which gate to go to. Since it isnâ€™t there, I asked an airport crew where should I go. He rudely told me â€œcheck on the board.â€ If the plane has flown, itâ€™s basic courtesy to inform me instead of telling me which gate to go to. After running all the way, I saw an empty gate. I went to a Turkish Airlines counter only to be sent from one counter to another. I was sent to other 4 counters in total. How you handle this situation is horrendous.

After take-off the crew took my orders and service was one of the quickest, unfortunately my meal option went out. But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing, as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate, cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free Wi-Fi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top.

I get upgraded most of the time, so I feel slightly guilty writing this review. However flying London Heathrow - Los Angeles every month, the service seems to be of a higher standard. Los Angeles - Sydney was the same aircraft, but no bar food. Flight attendants were tired on both legs of the trip. They were unpleasant and when asking for something, it was evidently a hassle. Bar - which 777-300ER on AA is now known for has no food option except a few apples and wine. Really? This is their selling point. I often appreciate not having to bother the crew and getting snacks myself. No mid-flight snacks are offered, no water run or anything. Crew just sit in the rest area playing on their ipads or reading books. When asked if I could get a wine or something I was met with ""You seem to be up the whole time."" As if to say - don't bother us and go to bed. Overall really disappointed with the service. I should fly QF again I guess after this.

Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation.

Qatar Airways,2.0,R Neil,2nd October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I booked a return flight with Qatar Airways from Sydney for a family trip to France. We had a good experience on the way to Paris and at Doha airport, flying with our young children. Our return flight was a morning flight at 8:55am from CDG airport. We had checked in online the night before. Due to a series of issues at CDG airport we arrived at the check-in counter at 8:10am, late for check-in, which closes 60 minutes before the flight. I immediately attended the Qatar Airways desk, where I explained the situation to an employee. The only response I obtained was â€œyou cannot get on the flight, we will put you on the next flightâ€. There was no attempt on behalf of the employee to problem-solve or to offer us solutions to get on our flight. At my insistence, she contacted the gate staff and again stated we would not be able to board the flight. At no stage did the employee suggest that part of our travelling party could board the flight with hand luggage only as we had already checked in online. This would have been a helpful suggestion allowing us time to reorganise our luggage and take essential items. However, the employee did not have a friendly or helpful approach, seeming to just want to put us on the next flight which was 14 hours later and would cost 2200 euros in fees. This was not an option for our family. I asked if my wife and the children could board with hand luggage only. The employee replied that it was too late. I insisted that she call the gate to see if this was a possibility. She called the gate and then told us again that it was too late, that the gate closes 20 minutes prior to departure and it was now 8:30, 25 minutes prior to departure. The employee stated that it would not be possible for us to reach the gate in five minutes- again no help was offered and her attitude was bad. At this point, we discounted her advice and ran to the gate as fast as possible with our two young children. This was a difficult experience for them and they were crying. If the employee had informed us of this option even 10 minutes earlier, we would not have had to rush as much as we did. Luckily the CDG airport staff were very helpful and my wife and children were able to get on the flight with our hand luggage. I returned to the Qatar Airways desk to re-book another flight in the evening. When I checked-in in the evening, I had to deal with poor customer service again. I have contacted Qatar Airways customer service on several occasions in the past month but their responses have basically been â€˜we are very sorry about thisâ€™ but they refuse to offer any compensation or explanation. I will not fly with Qatar Airways again, which is a shame because their inflight services were pretty good but the staff at Paris CDG airport were nasty.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sydney via Doha,August 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no

The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board.

Air Canada,2.0,G Darwin,1st September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Chicago. I fly on Air Canada two to three times per month, mostly to Chicago but also domestically and internationally. It is now the end of August and not one flight in 2017 has been on time. There are not always reasons given, but the result is always the same. Not only has this negatively impacted my business, it has also affected the impression that others have of me. Lateness has become an acceptable trend with this airline.

Emirates,3.0,J Rathikala,9th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Hyderabad to London via Dubai. After being advised that I could change my flight for my return journey, I managed to find a flight earlier and tried to pay for the ticket using my UK card, (for which I got charged for a failed transaction), Two credit cards from India and failed. There was money in the accounts but they couldn't take the money. I was advised to bring in cash to the airport on the day of travel. So I painstakingly managed to get 20,000 Rupees when currency was scarce in India and took it to the airport. The rude woman over the phone at the airport Emirates office just said she couldn't take my money because the call centre people didn't put the amount to pay on the ticket but it was confirmed conditionally? Didn't get that logic at all. So I had to call the call centre after putting some more credit as the average call time for a call to Emirates is a minimum of half an hour to an hour. Then the manager comes on the phone and directs me to someone else in the airport. I was due to fly at 9:20pm and hadn't paid for my ticket until 7:15 pm. I was scared to death as I had to report to work the next day. The casual and careless attitude of the Emirates airport staff didn't help relieve the tension. Somehow after going through so many people and so many phone calls I have finally managed to pay for my ticket and nearly didn't get my change if I didn't impose on it.

Emirates,8.0,Jean Roberts,21st October 2015,"The lure of a stopover in Dubai when flying Orlando to Cape Town was strong. Departed Orlando on the third day after the inaugural flight. In Business Class, Emirates offers limo pick up, which we did. I need a wheelchair, and that went very smoothly to the Business Lounge in Orlando - they were using a very small space, but nice lunch buffet. Seats 9A/B were fairly comfortable as were the other seats we had. Thank goodness for the addition of the long pad for sleeping. Remember the days of Delta being called ""Chicken airline"" because of their chicken meals, then Emirates should be called ""The Reboot airline"". On each of our four segments the computer had to be rebooted because either the ICE did not work, or the partition would not retract or the seat would not go into a flat position. Eventually my daughter had to move to another seat so she could sleep lying down - after all that is what we paid for. Otherwise, I would recommend Emirates to everyone. The service was excellent with only 40 business class passengers on the outward flight to Dubai, and 30 on the return flight. The flight attendants on the Orlando/Dubai segments both ways were so personable and looked after all the passengers. On the Dubai/Capetown segments they were competent, but aloof. One glitch was the wheelchair in Dubai on return trip - was told it was unnecessary as we would be in transit lounge. Not true. And in Orlando the chair was not visible until I finally just sat in the baggage lounge and said I was not going anywhere. We were fortunate to pay $8,000 for the two of us as a special offer.",Boeing 777-200LR / 300LR,Family Leisure,Business Class,MCO to CPT via DXB,September 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
United Airlines,3.0,David Liebskind,8th August 2014,United has become a terrible airline since the merger with Continental.

The A320 flight from Edinburgh in business class had seats in a 3x3 configuration with the middle seat empty, the seat pitch was fine for the short flight to Frankfurt.

To JNB we were in the upstairs section of the 747-800 which has 36 seats, again the crew were very good, and the food service for a 22.00 departure wasn't rushed, and the choice of wine and food were excellent. The breakfast after a decent few hours of sleep was served an hour or so before landing, and again it offered a decent choice of food with good coffee. The return flights were every bit as good as the outbound, again the cabin crew were very good, introducing themselves when we were seated, and using our names whenever we talked. After a very nice dinner, and watching a couple of up to date films it was time to settle down for a few hours sleep. After another good breakfast we landed on time at Frankfurt, and then made our way to terminal B for our flight back to Edinburgh on another A320.

The aircraft was an A320 which looks ageing on the seats and cabin layout. Service was very basic with the selection of salty snack or sweet snack and the choices of drinks were very little (arancia rossa/orange juice hot tea hot coffee or water/sparkling water). Crew were not very welcoming and seemed not to enjoy their job I also did notice that the crew did not pay attention carefully to passengers who have not opened the windows shades and fastened the seat belt before landing. In a sum Alitalia is not up to standard of premium airlines that they claim to be. Many rooms for improvements in order to compete with other regional airlines.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,H James,17th November 2014,Rio de Janeiro - London via Amsterdam B777-200. Overnight flight from Rio to London - lucky for me I got an empty seat next to me. The seat actually felt quite roomy for economy class seat pitch seemed generous. The exit row upgrade was absurdly priced at Â£120 (on a Â£490 flight) at time of booking - for comparison the first leg with Air France was Â£50 which I paid. KLM also offers 'economy comfort' which seems to be premium economy but at â‚¬180 to upgrade I ignored - you can check out on the seat map if you actually get more room but I looked closely on the way out of the plane and there is no discernible difference in pitch and still a 3x3x3 configuration. IFE was exceptionally poor on this flight - I'm not sure if 2014 has been a bad year for blockbusters but very little worth watching and each TV show only has one episode which is very annoying. Why would you only want to watch one episode is beyond me. Food was pretty decent though and the service attentive so overall a positive flight.

Delta Air Lines,,David Kaiser,14th April 2015,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away.

If you are sitting in the back, expect it to take at least 15-20 minutes to deplane. The outbound (BOS-ORD) plane, N57870, had no TVs. It was just overall a dirty and run-down plane. The return (ORD-BOS) plane, N75858, did have TVs. When I'm on a plane that has TVs, I usually watch a movie on my iPad and turn the TV to the map channel. It took almost 20 minutes for me to find the map, then while we were something like 15th in line for takeoff (because that's just how things happen at O'Hare), the screen told me that my ""free preview"" of DirecTV was up and I had to pay to continue using the TV for anything, including the map. Shortly after takeoff, I opened the movie on my iPad and saw that I had forgotten to rent the movie I wanted to watch (and I admit that this was on me). I decided to watch a movie on the seatback TV and just pay the fee. However, they didn't seem to want my money even when I was desperately throwing it at them. The credit card reader didn't work no matter how many different ways I swiped my card. Eventually, I paid for an hour of free internet on my phone and transferred it to my iPad. The flight was halfway through at this point. I fly this route (BOS-ORD and back) several times a year to visit family.

Aeromexico,1.0,Judy Lachman,7th January 2016,"We had a wonderful Aeromexico flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City en route to San Jose, Costa Rica. The plane had a stop in Mexico City for about 2-3hours and we all had to disembark. We went through Mexican airport immigration and we were given forms to fill out, which we did with no problem. We waited for our next flight to get going, but when I was boarding the flight attendent ask me for the immigration piece of paper that was given back to my husband but not to me. No one said that I needed one also, so we assumed it was a family trip immigration paper. Well, the flight attendant was very rude, could speak hardly any English and just told me I could not leave the country of Mexico without it. She told us to go find someone who could speak English. Well, as you can imagine, everyone else is boarding and we are rushing around trying to find an English speaking person. It was just hell! We finally did find another tourist who had the same problem, he directed us to a very angry man who said we had to fill out another immigration card and give him $20.00 U.S. Before I could leave the country. Well this took about an hour. By this time, our dream first class flight to Costa Rica had gone and so had our money which we had paid for it. We went immediately to Aeromexico customer service desk, hoping we could get on the next available flight - they were able to put us on a flight at 8:30 am the next morning but we were charged $1135.00US for 2 people in economy. We tried to explain the situation and circumstances which happened that were beyond our control. But still, we had to pay the amount or we weren't going. No empathy, no trying to help us at all. It was if you want to go you pay what they say. It was the most terrifying trip, landing there in Mexico and then being told you could not leave because you did not have a piece of paper which I was not given back, just my husband was.

First I try to book a one way ticket to Joplin, Mo but I guess you canâ€™t do that because the airports are small, so they had my flight going to LAX airport and me staying there for 2 an a half hours, which then went to Dallas and me stay there for an hour and a half just to then be in Joplin at 10pm when the flight from Phx was at 6am. I get to the check in place and the lady that is checking my bags tells me she going to change my flight because they is a delay that I didnâ€™t even know of, and she can make where I go to Dallas to then Joplin. So everything is going well until we are 10 mins from Dallas airport and I guess there was a storm and the Pilot didnâ€™t feel like he could landed there so he flies to Love Field airport where at first it was because the weather but then the fuel part broke and had us sitting on the plane for 4 hours. They finally fix it and then we get to Dallas and wait an hour again on the plane because they didnâ€™t have our gate ready. Everyone missed there flight and the workers were very rude. Everyone had to stay all night till the next day. But they booked my flight to Kansas City, Two hours away from Joplin, Mo. So I had to buy a rental car, thank god I had my credit card because they werenâ€™t going to give me one, and I drive two hour to Joplin. But thatâ€™s not it they tell me my bag had to go to Joplin so to pick it up there so when I got there no bag. I then had to go out and buy clothes till a lady drive my bag to me from Kansas City!

So we all know that economy gets you from A to B, safely and we are not expecting much especially with a short hop like this, only a one hour flight. Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3, 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft - an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg, some at least had the courtesy to apologize, most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic, tired looking, the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed, head in his hands, yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok, flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent - true skill.

The planes were clean flight attendants full of energy and smile. To my surprise the captain apologize for the slight delay we had from JFK to Narita. That is something you hear only on Asian Airlines. The seats were comfortable for economy and the food was great!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Air Canada,3.0,M Baya,25th October 2013,"Flew to Calgary on Oct 11 with a connecting flight through Vancouver with no major glaring problems. Flights were on time even a bit early. I usually fly with WestJet so I'm used to friendly flight attendants. Boarding this flight was quite a shock. The flight attendant at the front of the plane had a scowl on her face and didn't reply when I greeted her. Later during the in-flight service the same flight attendant asked me if I wanted pretzels. I said ""no no pretzels thank you"" and she didn't offer me a drink at all. I had to her co-worker for a drink and she looked annoyed that I asked. Cleanliness of the cabin was so-so. The floors were clear and there was no garbage in my seat pocket but the window I was sitting next to was coated in what I assume to be facial grease. Delicious. I'm currently preparing for my flights tomorrow and they have both been cancelled and delayed and now I have a layover in Vancouver for several hours. Even though Air Canada is offering other flights to my destination at an earlier time with several available seats they refused to change my flights. I booked my flights a day early to avoid missing mandatory engagements at my final destination due to many of my friends flying with Air Canada and sharing their horror stories about the service and cancellations/delays. I think its sad that a supposedly professional business can operate in such a manner. Air Canada needs to take lessons from WestJet or CMA on how to manage their passengers and timing schedule if they want my business again.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,8.0,T Eldem,20th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew. The French announcements from the cockpit were a nice touch. Flight departed late but arrived 40 minutes ahead of schedule.",,Business,Business Class,Istanbul to Montreal,2017-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,J Gillams,6th January 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | We had a flight from Oslo to Amsterdam. Because of fog at Schiphol airport the flight was cancelled. I had to take another fight from Brussels the day after and my friend had important meetings the day after. We called the call center in Amsterdam but it was too busy. We could not speak to a call center agent. We decided to immediately book a new KLM ticket for the same day but earlier. This flight was not cancelled. The tickets were 355 EUR for a very short flight. We expected KLM to refund the tickets as the call center was too busy and because of the force majeure situation. In the plane we met people that took the same flight as us but initially booked the later flight like us. They went to the airport and KLM (in fact SAS) staff booked them to the earlier flight FREE OF CHARGE. We called several times with the call center the day after but they didn't want to refund the 710 EUR. They said we had chosen ourselves to make extra costs. But for the airline (apart from credit card charges) it wasn't an extra cost at all. There were enough empty seats and we didn't take the flight the day after KLM booked us on later in the evening. They said we could try to get money back from travel insurance. They offered 2 vouchers as leniency but this was by far not the 710 EUR we had to pay for a very short European flight. Apart from the issue described my plane chair was broken and could not stand completely straight. It was a very old aircraft and they did not invest in a new chair which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and UNSAFE. So for a price of 355 EUR I had to sit in a broken chair. Very bad customer service and we never thought KLM was capable of doing this. Even Ryanair treats his customers better.Shame on you KLM!,Boeing 737-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Amsterdam,December 2018,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,7.0,R Sanyal,20th June 2016,"I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in a 777-200 plane on this two hour domestic route from New York JFK to Chicago. The flight was fine in every respect - departures and arrivals on time, a hot breakfast served - had two options to choose from, a hot towel to refresh was provided at take-off, and a blanket was available. Cabin attendants were very attentive. The business class seats are angled and lie down fully flat through I did not take advantage of this feature on such a short flight - the touch controls were easy to use. The selection of movies and TV fare was good enough - ""disposable"" headsets were provided on request. My seat faced the plane's rear and with the seats being angled the passenger across the aisle (whose seat faced the front of the plane) was directly in my sight line. This was a bit intrusive and disconcerting as each of us could see what we were doing throughout the flight.

Air Canada,3.0,Derek Cathcart,17th June 2014,"We flew the Dreamliner from ZUR to YYZ on June 1st. Found the environment in the new 787 to be an improvement but wonder who at AC signed off on the configuration and details. On our flight alone we had a number of ""spills"" because the earphone cords come out of the forward seatback and cross the table (in both Y and Premium Y). Then there is the issue of the controls on top of the armrest that are constantly being touched either by your arm or the person to your side. Mid section washrooms should have been back 5 or more rows to balance 'demand' front and rear. Cabin staff were well aware of this after a week of operation and blamed Boeing - not their fault as each airline does their own interior. Have been on at least 6 other 787 aircraft from other carriers (AC's first is #160 that Boeing made) and the others did not have these faux pas. AC needs to address these issues ASAP as they have nearly 40 more 787 coming! Food was the worst I have endured in the past 2-3 on any carrier.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,yes
Aeromexico,2.0,Colin Moran,4th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Mexico City to Washington. I was traveling from Cabo San Lucas to Washington, DC. My connection flight was in Mexico City. I spent $25 USD on my first flight from Cabo to Mexico City to upgrade my seat, as well as have zone 2 boarding. That flight was great. On my connecting flight from Mexico City to Washington, DC I spent $75 USD to upgrade my seat and have zone 2 boarding. Before boarding I was called up to the front desk by a AeroMexico representative, who I informed immediately I did not speak Spanish. He told me that I was going to have a random bag check and to step to the side. I agreed, as this was no problem. There was a second gentlemen in front of me who was also having a random bag check. When he was finished, I was told by another AeroMexico representative to proceed to the security woman to check my bags. When I gave my passport and bags to the security woman (who I also informed I did not speak Spanish) she waved me through without checking my bags and said I was free to go. I walked down the ramp as instructed and started to wait in line to board my flight. 5 minutes later, the AeroMexico representative that was working the ticket counter came screaming down the ramp, yelling my name and making a huge scene in front of everyone in line. He would not let me talk and was yelling at me that I should have had my bags checked. I was trying to tell him that the security woman had waved me through and that I had stopped like he told me to to have my bags checked. He would not stop yelling and also put his hand on my shoulder pushing me forward. I was being treated like a criminal when I had nothing to hide and also followed his directions. Once he escorted me to the security woman at the top of the ramp she informed him that she had waved me through. He never apologized to me. My bags were checked and I was free to go. I was very embarrassed and scared that I had done something wrong when I had not. I do not appreciate being treated like this, especially when I paid extra money to have my seat upgraded.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Rony Liebheit,1st February 2016,"While in Nepal we were informed of a 2 hr delay of our Turkish Airlines return flight upon arrival in IST. There was no info about the connecting flight to Stuttgart for which there would be only 1/2 h to get it. Back in KTM we learned that we'd have to stay the night in IST. We managed to get a flight a day earlier, thus at least making up for the time loss. The flight was very pleasant. But info and service on arrival that evening in IST was appalling. We had to find our own way through the airport, no signs and not knowing where to report for the hotel supplied by the airline. After standing in line for the passport controll we were told we need a visa, so we had to go back to another counter and pay 50 USD for a visa. When, finally finding the counter for the hotel, there was another long lineup and and afterwards we sat waiting for a shuttle. The hotel was 10 min away, very nice and we got a late supper around 22:30. The food was disappointing. Next morning, without breakfast, we had to shuttle back to the airport at 5 in the morning for a 9:30 flight. We were through security and passport controlls by 5:30, the gate wasn't announced until 8:20 and only then we were able to go and sit. All these are things that happen when travelling. But what annoys me to no end is that the airline refuses to refund our visa fee. What makes it worse is the reason given: we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight, flying a day earlier. I suppose we did acknowledge the delay -2 hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses. The downtown airline office in STG does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way. The same applies to the airport office. My request then forwarded to IST was first returned because it was in German. For every message to IST one has to jump all the hoops on their website and over and over again fill out the forms. The very poor info-policy and service of Turkish Airlines, the only way to deal with the airline through IST and not in one's own country and the refusal to refund our visa fee totally spoils an otherwise pleasant experience with the airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,KTM to STR via IST,January 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

Virgin America,10.0,S Srinivasan,18th December 2014,LAX-DAL in Main Cabin Select 08/12/14. We checked in online and utilized the express bag drop at LAX. There was a short line and we were attended to promptly by a cheerful agent. Main Cabin Select comes with priority security so we sailed through the TSA line. T3 at LAX is rather dour though this isn't VX's fault. Boarding started on time and we pushed back a few minutes early. The safety video is cheesy and gets annoying pretty quickly but otherwise service was excellent. FAs weren't exceptional but they were friendly and efficient and I personally think all airlines should adopt the in-seat ordering system for food and beverages you select whatever you want at your leisure and an FA brings it to you within a couple of minutes. Leather seat was comfortable and had plenty of legroom thanks to the bulkhead. Snacks were of good quality and the meal I ordered was tasty but not excessively heavy. We landed nearly 15 minutes early and we were in our car and on our way about 20 minutes after landing. Main Cabin Select is a good value as it includes one checked bag priority boarding and security and food and drink at no extra charge. We were impressed with VX will consider them more often now that they've beefed up service from Dallas.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

First Cabin in on the main deck in the nose of the aircraft and very airy. The design is very nice, and very seat has still the beautiful and fresh red rose. The only disappointment is the small size of the screen and the quality of the bed (not the best flat bed is not the best in the industry.

Delta Air Lines,7.0,David Bergstrom,25th November 2015,"Flew Delta in First from AUS to SAN, via SLC roundtrip. Iâ€™M Silver with Delta, Platinum with AA and Gold with Virgin. Delta ranks third for their First Class offering. Seat pitch is the tightest at 37â€, the food options on flights under 900 miles is a snack basket. As a Sky Club member, in addition to Admirals Club membership, we used both. I feel Deltaâ€™s Clubs are minimalistic in comparison. The bars are small and the food offering are somewhat amateurish. Donâ€™t get me wrong. Boarding was orderly and we did not have to wait due to Priority. The planes were clean, the seat cushion is comfortable. All our flights left on time and arrived on time. Breakfast served to SLC, a plate with a Bagel Breakfast Sandwich on it, a side dish with some fruit. The Quality and taste were fine, the meal just looked un substantial compared to my other proffered carriers. The flight attendant to SLC was pleasant, did his job quickly and sat and read for the remainder of the flight. The Flight to SAN had a very proactive flight crew, constantly in the aisle, refilling drinks and constantly passing the snack basket, with some decent offerings. The return flight to SLC offered again the snack basket and some wine. A somewhat cold, but very professional attendant served us on this leg. She performed her job very well. The last flight to Austin offered dinner. After my earlier in the week breakfast flight, I was not expecting much. I was surprised to be offered a perfectly cooked Fillet, with sides and a dinner roll. Desert sadly was a pre packed brownie (Really, Prepackaged in First). All in all Delta did its job, we were spot on time and our bags came out fairly quickly. The food offering are spares in compared to other, but what was offered was of decent quality.

We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide. The downside was that we hadn't been able to select seats in advance, and I noted that the first row of seats was empty and would've preferred to have been seated in a row on my own, where I could get up freely, rather than next to a stranger, whom I had to disturb if I wanted to get up. I wasn't even able to select window seat or aisle seat, which I think is unsatisfactory. Other than this, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing. Apart from not being able to select seats, it was far superior to the KLM business flight that I took on the return flight. Having said that, the staff - though efficient - were rather 'cold' in their manner (never smiled and never exchanged pleasantries), which is a sharp contrast to the KLM staff on the return flight. (But this might reflect Eastern European professional culture - I experienced similar cold, but efficient, professionalism once in a 5 star hotel in Tallin.)

American Airlines,2.0,W Gearan,10th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Kahului. Customer service training must happen or happen more frequently. I have flown many times on business trips and with my family. I have never experienced what we experienced this trip. Our flight to Florida was okay. On our way back home, we were checking in at the Orlando Airport. A AA agent told us that we had to check in our Sit & Stand stroller. We told her that it was never a problem coming and all the past times we traveled. She said that at this airport, we had no choice and had to check it in. I went to ask another AA agent. I politely said, ""Good morning Maam"" to get her attention. She looked at me and said, ""Uuuggg"", you are the second person that called me Maam today! What do you want?"" I looked at her and said, ""I'll ask someone else"". Can you imagine the things you need to carry while traveling with two children? This made it very difficult to travel with two young children to say the least. When passing through TSA, we asked what the deal was and they said, it was okay with TSA. They check and allow any type of stroller. We got up to our gate and we saw one family on the flight before us who had the same exact Sit & Stand stroller and had no questions asked and strolled right into the jet way. I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed. I found that hard to believe as another family checked in a double stroller (wider and more bulky than what we had). I looked around and noticed that we were the only family without our stroller. When we got to Texas, the AA agent was so rude. We asked if our family could sit closer together. She asked for my boarding pass. Since my wife had it, I asked if I could show her a picture on my phone. She looked at me and said, ""I don't want to hold you phone. Phones are full of germs.""

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Vina Barahman,12th January 2016,"On January 1st, 2016, my flight from Tehran to Istanbul (TK875) was delayed for over 5 hours. The passengers, including myself did not receive any prior notification from the airline. Considering that many previous flights were cancelled due to weather conditions in Istanbul, the airline had surely predicted delay, but failed to inform the passengers, or make announcements in the airport. No information was provided from the Turkish Airline Staff, and finally when the plane took off and landed in Istanbul, we had to wait another 2 hours for the plane to be allowed to park. I had already missed my flight to New York (TK 003) which was scheduled for 7:25 on that morning. I understand that sometimes the weather conditions can cause delays and cancellations. What I am complaining about is the poor management, rude attitude of Turkish Airline Staff, and the very low-quality service provided by the staff in the airport. When I finally got out of the plane, we were confronted with a terminal full of stranded, confused, and unorganized passengers. There was no airport or Turkish Airlines Staff to guide us to the correct directions. Naturally we went to the Transfer Desk, to get information on how to get on the next available flight. More than 1500 passengers were jammed around the counter. There was not even one airport, security or airline staff to organize people and ask them to stand in line. Every one was just jammed in front of the counter. There was rarely enough space to breathe or move. The staff behind the transfer desk were clearly incapable of managing the situation. Instead of managing it, they also lost control and were shouting and banging their fists on the counter! After 2 hours of standing there, my passport was lost by one of the staff, and I had to wait for another hour for them to find it. Only to find out that all that trouble was for nothing, as I was told to go through passport control and then to the Check-in terminal, and go to Turkish Sales Office. This demonstrates the incapability and poor management of the airline and staff. They wanted to get rid of me by making me enter Turkey (through passport control) and go to check-in terminal, so that I am not their problem any more! I had no other choice, so I followed their advice. The Sales Office line was a nightmare. The line stretched all along the Ataturk Airport check-in Terminal. Turkish Airlines Staff couldnâ€™t care less. They acted indifferent and did not help in any way. I immediately begged one of the staff to help me get on the last flight of the day (TK11) at 5:30. A staff member helped me go through and I was told that I can sit on flight TK11 to New York, on business class, and they told me to go to Business Check-in Counter E.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,IKA to JFK via IST,January 2016,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Jay Siegel,29th December 2015,"Newark to Tel Aviv with United Airlines. This is an airline that overtly wants to demonstrate that they don't have any regard for their customers. This is for an upcoming flight. I had booked weeks before with a seat assignment for 2 people. As though it was a class magical act, the seat assignments disappeared. I attempted to receive an assigned seat and could not do so. We paid over $1000 for these seats and the UAL agent and supervisor could not, or would not, assign a seat. We are told we cannot get a seat assignment unless it is the day of departure from the airport. Unless you want to pay an extra $209 for an Economy Plus Seat.

No one in the call centre could do the upgrade because there was no manager, which seems to be the title for the only staff who can make decisions. Told that we were lucky to be on the flight at all. They forgot to rebook our son on the next leg to Calgary and so had to take a later flight with 5 hour layup instead of 1.5 hours.

The service is exactly the same as in Economy. However, Economy Comfort seats are usually much more affordable than Premium Economy seats.

Aeromexico,1.0,E Weisbord,18th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | On a recent trip with Aeromexico, I attempted to check in at the airport desk and was told that without proof of exit from my destination, I would not be allowed to check in and board my flight. As I was under time constraints to check in and board my flight, I was pressured by the clerk and the manager on duty to buy a ticket on the spot to show them. I was assured that the ticket I was buying was immediately and fully refundable and simply had to call them to cancel it when I arrived at my destination. I found out afterwards that this was all completely untrue and that I wasn't required to show the ticket desk anything of the sort. Regardless, I had done what they asked in good faith, assuming that at least their reassurance that I could get my money back quickly was true. (Side note: a fully refundable flight from Mexico City to Miami cost over $1400). I then called to cancel my flight and was assured that I would receive my reimbursement within 4-6 weeks. I spent the following two weeks requesting a written statement of this and finally received it by email. Three months later, I still have not received my reimbursement and have been paying interest on this large amount. Customer service has been non-communicative, taking weeks to respond to simple requests for follow up. The call centers refuse to answer questions relating to reimbursements or complaints. Recently, they even admitted in writing that the mistake was theirs due to a typo. Yet, still no reimbursement. I have never experienced such poor and unfair customer service.

Boarding done by row numbers and well controlled. Seating on 777 narrower but I found more comfortable than the A380. Entertainment vast and varied. Food ok. But why do airlines still insist on providing hot breakfasts in the very early hours which are so unappetising. My poached eggs could have survived a set at Wimbledon! And three hours before landing at 4am when I had just got off to sleep - surely no need.

Alitalia,4.0,Ivan Nikitin,1st November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Poor experience with Alitalia on Moscow-Rome-Naples-Palermo-Moscow route. Disorganised check-in in Moscow and Naples, where very few counters were open, led to very long waiting time. Moscow to Rome was delayed for 50 minutes for no apparent reason. Flight crew were quite nice, but the food was appalling - only a small muffin on a 3.5 hour flight is simply unacceptable. No spirits, wine or beer. The aircraft was very old, some seats had duct tape around the armrests. Seat pitch was uncomfortable, though after asking the crew I was reseated to another row. Due to the delay I have missed the connection to Naples and had to be rebooked to the next flight, which only came 4,5 hours later. I was given a food voucher for a sandwich, some fruit and a soft drink, but nothing else. Have filed a claim, still haven't heard back in a week. Rome-Naples - A319 with a truly appalling seat pitch - I have never experienced such uncomfortable seats. Most passengers could not sit in these at all, everyone was twisted sideways. No service whatsoever, not even water. Naples-Palermo - Embraer E-175 with surprisingly comfortable seats and decent cabin, service consisted of soft drinks only. Palermo-Moscow - A320 with, once again, uncomfortable seats. I was lucky to sit in an emergency exit row, though the pitch honestly was more or less the same as the pitch on premium airlines in standard economy seat. Service consisted of a small ham sandwich (flight duration is 4 hours), my requested special meal never came. Full drinks service, including wine. The crew on this flight were apathetic, with no intent to smile or create a pleasant experience, though all requests were quickly dealt with. Overall, Alitalia is not an airline I wish to fly with, considering its current state, but for the price (and the price for these flights - with luggage - was around 150 EUR in total) it was acceptable.","A321 / A319 / E175 /, A320",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Naples via Rome,October 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,no

Air Canada,2.0,Ahmad Nadim,19th January 2015,In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,3.0,Natalie Stevenson,23rd November 2015,"My husband and I purchased tickets for $38,000. to fly first class on Emirates from San Francisco to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was going to be our ""trip of a lifetime"" so we spent the extra money to try the first class experience we had heard so much about. We boarded the plane and were served drinks, but about an hour later we had to de-plane due to an electrical failure. We waited in the airport and were given hourly updates for the next 5-7 hours while we waited to board again and take off. Eventually the flight was cancelled. We got no information at the airport from Emirates about what to do, where to go, or how to rebook.

We went to the hotel and were not able to get information about rebooking our flight until 2:00 am. The flight went out the following day but involved 2 hours of waiting in line to get checked in. My husband is blind and I had one leg in a cast so the delay was really excruciating. We were awarded 100,000 Skyward miles for the inconvenience. The delay caused us to lose out on the first day of our Safari which cost us roughly $2000, and we could not recoup. I wrote a letter to Emirates saying that we understood these mechanical problems do happen but given the cost of our ticket we wanted better compensation. I got a polite letter back telling us basically ""no"" that they had done all they were going to do, and that was the end of it. I was pretty stunned at that response given that after having paid $38,000.",,Couple Leisure,First Class,SFO to JNB via DXB,October 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,3.0,F Eliadis,22nd April 2015,"We flew to Phoenix from Montreal with a Detroit connection and cannot believe what is passing for a decent airline experience in the US these days (the return on American Airlines was just as bad). The least passengers should expect from an airline is a seat that is not torn and filthy a plane that leaves on time and that arrives on one piece. Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago. Seats were small and do not get me started on the pitch. Dilapidated and depressing two other words starting with ""D"". Delta needs a makeover.

United Airlines,1.0,G Leath,6th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to San Diego. So ridiculous and simply unprofessional. I have a connecting flight here in San Francisco, I arrived 4 hours before my connection leaves. I looked at a departures board and noticed another United flight left in just an hour. Went to the United customer service desk to see if I could switch. The woman at the counter didn't have the decency to great me with a hello and before I even finished asking my question she told me there was nothing I could change at all. Her response was simply ""no changes"". I went to the gate and asked if there were seats available, the gate attended said ""possibly"" then looked at my ticket and informed the contract I signed when booking basic economy forbid me from changing flights. I asked ""even if there are empty seats on an earlier flight?"" And she said ""no changes can be made with this ticket if it were economy I might be able to do something"". I'm happy the gate employee at least explained my situation but this is ridiculous. United wanted to charge me another $35 for this trip to be economy. I paid $75 so that's nearly a increase. I understand I bought a cheap ticket, that's why I wasn't even allowed a carry on bag. However, when there's something as simple as putting a passenger, with no carry on or checked luggage, on the same size aircraft going to the same destination and United won't do it. That's ridiculous. It wouldn't cost them a dime more but I wasn't at the right paygrade for the company to care. Basically what I heard from United today was ""give me money and I'll give a sh*t about you"".

And this includes liquor bought from duty free.

I'm not a big man, so economy seating rarely presents me with a problem, and for me the available legroom was fine regardless of aircraft type. The A380 was a cut above the others in terms of comfort and quietness though, but the service was a little wooden and certainly slow, but the food was not bad at all. Service was slightly better on the DXB-SGN return legs, food reasonable but nothing to write home about. One thing I wish Emirates would move away from is the overcrowded serving tray or at least change the shape of it! A square tray balanced on a rectangular seat table is not a great fit. Entertainment was good, except for the Boeing 777 leg (limited choices and poor picture quality), so slept, read, listened to music on that one.

There was no IFE in most of flights: although Wi-Fi was supposed to provide access to movies, it did not work in any of the flights I took. On the flight GUM-PVG the IFE was in the form of small screens at the back of the seat. Movie selection was poor. Flights were mostly late: SFO-HNL was more than 1 our late. I was upgraded to premium seats on the SFO-HNL and HNL-GUM flights. Seats are OK. Although we were supposed to receive a meal on the GUM-PVG flight, I did not receive any food.

On my recent flight on American Airlines it came to a new low at least as far as entertainment is concerned. The available selection and more so the interface is not something I expected to see on a Boeing 777. The movie selection was minuscule, even compared to carriers such as United. The New release selection comprised a handful of features and most of them weren't even that new. The features are not ""on demand"" they have a cycle and you have to either watch what is in progress or wait for the next feature to start. The food in general is mediocre but since my flight originated in London it is probably better than if I had started my trip in Miami.

Clean cabins, clean toilets, cheerful staff and smart snack concept including bar service. Somehow there was no battle over overhead luggage space despite full flights. Flights out were bang on time.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,Judika Chaba,15th August 2015,"First we flew LAX to Savannah via Atlanta. The plane was late every step of the way. My twin 9 year olds and I were going for a small vacation, then to pick up a dog in Valdosta, GA and back home to LA. The LAX personnel with only one exceptional woman were surly and unhelpful. Because I was picking up a dog on the way back, I couldn't pick up my boarding pass electronically. The lines for help were long and the electronic rejection gave no answer. I tried to get help from 3 different Delta personnel, these were women who were recounting their evenings the night before and had no desire and felt no need to interrupt their gossip with work. Finally I found a friendly face among in the Delta line-up and this woman helped. The air crew was surly. Didn't think it was their job to help put up a bag. Turned up her little nose when my son asked for a drink. Atlanta to Savannah they held us on the tarmac 2 hours. Horrible. The way back was even worse. They were nice enough in Valdosta - which is so tiny they sort of have to be - nevertheless they body-searched an 80 year old woman in security. As usual the plane was delayed at Atlanta. Here there was no help available once you got there. Surly personnel. As a Amex Platinum card carrier, I was told I had the right to use the Delta Lounge. Since I was carrying a puppy and had my boys, we went to the lounge. The rude pretentiousness was shocking, and they refused to let us in the lounge. I called Amex and filed a protest and they called - but at that point I'd seen the pitiful offerings and decided to take the kids to PF Changs. The flight to LA was delayed 1.5 hours. When I got to the gate, I asked the girl at the desk what time the plane would actually board. The rude young women snapped at m: ""I just said that it would be in 1/2 an hour..."" I answered her: Obviously I just got here and didn't hear you or I wouldn't ask. Really, Delta? This is who you consider an appropriate employee? That's professional? Other passengers were complaining about her and about her male cohort. To board the plane it was complete chaos. Like being in a Third World country with a free-for-all at boarding - starting from the front rather than the back - so there is the inevitable bottleneck, and no clear instructions anyway. Again the flight crew think they're above helping with a bag. They're too busy to bring a meal mid-flight - for a child! Surliness, snootiness. Bad attitude. I thought United was bad.

Arrived at boarding gate about an hour before the departure time and was told to go ahead and grab our seats inside the plane. The cabin crew appeared to have little or no training in their jobs. They wore dirty shabby uniform. No safety checks or seatbelt checks prior to take off as one would expect from any airline. Rushed safety announcement which was barely understandable. The meal they served resembled a frozen microwavable quick meal. I picked the chicken offering which smelt and tasted horrible. Cabin crew were mostly absent through the entire flight. On our return leg same story with the meal - I didn't even bother to touch it. IFE screen was frozen on my wife's seat and despite promises from a crew to reboot it nothing worked. Headphones for half the passengers in my section were broken as could be seen from passenger complaints onboard. I fly this route at least once a year and do not look forward to flying EK again unless desperate.

Aeromexico,4.0,F Vedrenne,11th August 2015,"I usually enjoy flying Aeromexico, and have had great experiences with them. The problem is that they are hit or miss, and this time is was a great miss. Only one person checking a whole flight in, other counters were open for the rest of Aeromexico red eyes, yet flights to Canada back then had to be checked in by ""specially trained people"" (whatever that means) - which today consisted of only one lady who looked overwhelmed. There was no online check in for this flight for the same reasons cited above. On other occasions on the same flight, Aeromexico had at least three agents, and Air Canada has 4 agents checking in two canada-bound flights. There was no priority check-in for those traveling in Clase Premier. Once I got my boarding pass, I went to look for a floor manager so that he could bring other agents to assist this poor lady, I do not know if it worked. Security went swiftly, personnel at MEX tend to be very friendly. Terminal 2 is way better than terminal 1 in that it feels more spacious and smells less bad. The Premier lounge was OK. It has a modern decor which might look a bit cold . It was quite crowded given the high number of Aeromexico's late night departures (YUL, CDG, NRT, UIO, JFK, ORD etc). Boarding happened in a very organized way, but upon boarding, I realized that as opposed to my previous experiences on this route, this plane was not the newer ones. The male purser was standing at the entrance greeting everyone as if it was a hassle. Seats were in terrible condition and the plane was not particularly clean. Entertainment system consisted of drop down screens that had a terrible resolution, and earphones worked partially. Even in Clase Premier, legroom was appalling. The purser was a bit unfriendly, but the other flight attendant, who kept coming back and forth from the main cabin was outstanding. Once airborne, we were given snacks, and except from the aforementioned flight attendant who I kept seeing over and over again, the rest of the crew proceeded to get paid for sitting down in the jump-seat. Food was served one hour before the estimated arrival time, and its quality was borderline. We were put on holding pattern for nearly one hour but there was no information about this from the flight crew, maybe they thought that nobody would notice. Deplaning went swiftly, but after crossing the air bridge, the glass doors towards the terminal were locked and we had to wait some time for Aeromexico ground staff to come and open it (I suppose it is best to open it before passengers actually deplane). Overall a pretty mediocre-bad experience, it is a shame to receive the same type of service you would receive on a MEX-CUN flight on the largest North American route of the company, and for it to be delivered with such carelessness. Consistency is key in customer service, and it hurts me to see how Aeromexico proudly parades this flaw both in terms of hard and soft products.

The charge to move the flight back one day so we could get a temp I-551 in her passport was almost as much as the tickets themselves. Then the customer service rep tried to tell me on the phone that she didn't need her green card to board the flight when I tried to explain why we needed to try to move it. While he was right, we didn't need it for her to leave the US, we needed it for her to get back into the US, had I listened to him my wife would have been stranded in Mexico. That is the type of thing a customer service rep who deals with a lot of international travel should know. Then after about 20 minutes of talking to them I am told the fee can be waived but it cannot be done over the phone. I have to e-mail somebody and it takes 24-72 hours to hear back. My flight left in 48 hours.

Emirates,6.0,C Baxter,17th March 2015,Dubai to Sydney Economy Class. After reading other postings here for Emirates just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see but a poor selection in English unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,S Quei,31st July 2015,"The original reservation was SJCâ€“ATLâ€“BCN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCNâ€“ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights.

The planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. Without doubt Emirates is the rudest airline I have flown and they are not improving. Instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. Instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say ""where are you from?"" I think in the entire flight I heard one please or thank you. I really don't care if they don't enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they weren't abrupt surly and clumsy.

Lufthansa,7.0,F Bertoni,19th January 2015,Sao Paulo-Frankfurt in Premium Economy operated with a packed 748. Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew as always with Lufthansa is efficient similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class.

They even arranged my vegetarian meal from business class as it was not loaded. TK serves fresh orange juice and lemonade which is perhaps the best drink I have had on onboard! Meals are always tasty and crew are friendly and helpful although I have to say that Chef-onboard service is absolutely useless. Chef did not even know what the vegetarian meal was on TK flights but thanks to the crew who got me something to eat although it came an hour after the service.

American Airlines,3.0,Jasmine Thomas,18th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I am writing this letter in utter disgust and frustration. I was travelling on A2657 from Orlando to Miami on 14/1/18 with what was to be a connecting flight to Antigua on A2405. Much to my surprise, we landed at MIA 5 minutes early, only to be held on the tarmac for an hour, all because there was an aircraft still at the gate, so much for being early. So AA had a plane for an hour, on the tarmac just waiting with passengers who had connecting flights. To make matters worst being the concerned passenger I asked the head flight attendant a question, to which she had the audacity to rudely state that I should have flew in the night before. The nerve of her. After finally being able to deplane & having to scramble to G21, much to my demise the flight had already closed off, and instead of aiding assistance to an already frustrated me, the female agent rudely said we are not getting on. Seems like some of these females employed by AA need training. The male agent made it his priority to calm an already angered me. Good Job to him. He advised me that the airline would accept fault. You would think that my anger would have ended there. After being told that I would be placed in a hotel at the expense of the airline, I was given a $12 food voucher. Really American. I had to pay an additional $15 for proper food. Another Issue was the shuttle that was to take me to the hotel had me waiting 2 hours, by this time I had given up. Fast forward to Monday 15th shall we, I got to the airport thinking it would be a better day but no, here I was thinking that my first class seat 4C would still be available so I could at least have one thing to smile about.

CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed.

A7-BAX was a new aircraft and the new type of seats were found to be much more comfortable than the earlier ones. Flight departure was on schedule and arrived early which gave us a comfortable time-gap to transfer to another flight. For lunch there were 3 options and the ones we ordered were very palatable, snacks were readily available throughout the flight. The transfer service at Doha airport was exceptionally good - we had requested wheel chairs and were provided electric 'buggies' from one end of the terminal [B] to end of terminal C and so onto terminal D as well as being escorted onto the bus and up to the aircraft door - we experienced no hassle at all and would like to thank Qatar Airways ground staff and Doha airport. The flight from Doha to Islamabad was operated by an A320 A7-ADG a mid-aged aircraft, however the cabin was well maintained and the washrooms were clean - we found this surprising as our experience on this sector has been somewhat different on other airlines. The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry.

One bag was severely damaged the other one completely destroyed. The pieces of the bag and its damaged and broken content were delivered in a plastic bag with a handwritten note that the bag was run over by a truck. We filed a claim with Delta online and received a confirmation email that they received our claim. After two weeks of no further emails from Delta we called several times to be updated on our case and how to proceed. Very poor customer service, extremely unorganized.

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldnâ€™t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Mombasa via Istanbul,September 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,no

The staff is never helpful in providing information, and are often incredibly rude and dismissive. I have missed several events due to their delays.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,S Ritter,31st May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Chicago. I am incredibly disappointed and disheartened by my most recent experience with Southwest Airlines. Let me preface this by saying that I have been flying Southwest for years, am an active rewards member, and currently have three upcoming trips already booked (booked before this experience). I flew out of Orlando, FL on Thursday night 5/24 at 9:15 on flight 1388 with my husband and 9 pound dog. We have flown multiple times with our dog in the past. I have always given our dog Melatonin to help her sleep while we fly (to avoid her ears popping/hurting). She was given Melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. We sat in our chosen aisle, me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and I juggled two drinks. A flight attendant decided to approach us and say ""What's in the bag?"" to which my husband answered, ""a dog."" Terry then said, ""Okay, it needs to go under the seat."" No problem, we know that already so we said, ""Okay, we're just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under."" He then came back I kid you not within one minute to proceed saying, ""The dog needs to go under the seat."" At this point we were getting a little upset. Once again my husband said, ""We know."" He then stayed right behind our seat while I gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. I looked at my husband and mumbled, ""Gosh, can we put our seatbelts on?"" At that time, the FA very abrasively turned around, stepped into our aisle, and proceeded to yell at me saying, ""Yeah you can put your seatbelt on!"" I looked at him like a deer in headlights and said, ""Okay, I think you need to take it down."" He then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying, ""Take what donw, tell me what I need to take down?"" By this point my husband and I were visibly upset. I again said, ""Take it down."" but again he continued to yell at me and say, ""I did nothing wrong!"" My husband said, ""Actually, you're yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong."" He was the most ill behaved employee I have ever encountered in customer service. Not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. There were people recording this. Finally he stormed off. I began crying. The entire ordeal was disrespectful, disgusting, and completely unacceptable. I pay $95 dollars each way (just like every other person who flies with their pup) so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. In addition, we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience. I called Southwest to make a complaint and was able to speak to a very nice woman who unfortunately informed me that not much would be done. This complaint would get added to his file and the incident would be used as a ""coaching"" lesson. Basically, this individual's egregious conduct was endorsed by lack of follow through. I am beyond let down. I am in no way looking for this man to be terminated at all, but he does 100% owe both me and my husband a formal apology for his flagrant behavior and nothing is being done to rectify the situation appropriately.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chicago,2018-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,J Armstrong,21st November 2015,"I called United to book a one way flight from LA to Dallas, but the person I spoke with could not speak English very well. After repeating, again and again the date of travel, this person finally managed to check the schedules and found a morning flight. I listened carefully, without interruption, to the flight times and flight numbers. United's agent said, ""OK, sir, I have you booked on flight XXX from LA to NY to Dallas. Can I have your credit card information please? I thought it strange that a United flight would travel across the USA to NY, turn aound and then fly to Dallas. I asked the agent if there was a more direct flight available and he replied, ""No."" I then said to the agent, ""Why is it necessary to fly first to NY and then to Dallas."" The agent replied, ""Sir, this is our schedule. A short lay over in NY and then to Dallas International."" Dallas International? I lived in Dallas for many years, and always knew the airport as DFW/Dallas Ft. Worth. Are you talking about Dulles International (not Dallas) in Washington, DC? The United agent replied, ""Yes sir, of course."" I said, ""No thanks,"" and hung up the phone. I was seconds away from giving this United agent my credit card information for an incorrect flight because of his inability to understand English. Last week I again telephoned United and was again connected to an agent with less than perfect English speaking ability. I hung up the phone. When I spend hundreds of dollars, if not thousands, on a particular product I become more cautious. And when I have trouble communicating with a vendor about such products because of a language issue, then I become wary and concerned that my questions and/or instructions will be either misunderstood or ignored. Find another vendor. United needs to understand that it's employees become their public image. And employees that cannot communicate properly will give the public a bad impression of United. United apparently does not understand that poor communication means poor customer service. And poor customer service always means a loss of business. Another issue is trust.

The seats are uncomfortable, they always delay and cancel flights and their staff are not helpful at all. Today I arrived at the airport with my sister and asked if I can check in with her. They refused, checked in my bag (under weight) then weighed her bags and realized that hers was over, but by then we didn't have mine to shift the weight. We moved way out of the way and attempted to move things to the carry on, but their employee just stood above us insisting we go to the designated bag opening area and refused to understanding that our flight is close to departure time.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,M Tushishvili,23rd June 2014,I had return flight CDG-TBS-CDG via Istanbul by Turkish last month. The service overall was really excellent. The food was very good nicely presented and tasty. Cabin attendants were professional in all flights nothing to complain about. Seats are ok for a couple of hours flights with the overhead screens and consequently limited entertainment. I have three observations for improvement: 1) The Business lounge in Sabina airport is very unpleasant a box size room with no edible food available. 2) The Ataturk airport (I had it for return flight) was extremely busy and flights are usually delayed for 30-45 minutes. 3) I observed that the light in cabins during the boarding catering (almost two hours) and landing was extremely bright (it is annoying when there is late evening or night flight).

American Airlines,1.0,Lauren Gargiulo,16th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Philadelphia to Orlando return and will never fly American Airlines again. A horrendous experience! My family and I were taking our first family vacation in 20 years, as there are 9 of us, we booked our flight almost a year in advance to ensure that we would sit together, especially since my 2 year old niece would be coming as well and it was her first time flying. About a month before our trip we were told that all of our seats were changed and none of us could sit together. They had my 2 year old niece sitting in a seat alone. When we called to sort this out we encountered nothing but pure rudeness and constant transfers. After 4 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone trying to just change one seat so my niece wasn't alone, we were told there was nothing we could do and would have to try and change our seat at the airport, mere hours before we were supposed to take off and that nothing was guaranteed. We started out in Philly, flying to Orlando. The entire staff was rude, yelling at passengers as we tried to board the plane telling us that we had to check our carry on bags because there was no space left on the plane. After all the chaos, she was able to sit with her daughter and a nice man switched seats with her husband, so my niece was able to fly with both her parents by her side. Once we got on board there was plenty of room for additional carry ons, some overhead compartments were completely empty. We had a wonderful vacation and then on the flight back home we had the same issue. My entire family was spread throughout the plane and once again my 2 year old niece was booked in a seat alone. The staff on the flight coming home were much nicer and much more accommodating but it wasn't confirmed that my sister would be able to sit with her daughter until literally 1 minute before we boarded. As we were attempting to switch her seats we met several other families that had the same issues as we did. Countless children 7 and younger were seated alone and apart from their families. And AA didn't extend an apology nor an explanation as to why they needed to separate everyone. I will never fly this airline again.

The aircraft was cold when we boarded and we were told the heating would be turned on once the door was closed and there was nothing they could do in the interim. So we all actually went into our bags and pulled out our jackets to put them on. When I was offered a beverage before takeoff I asked for a hot tea I was told there would be no hot beverages before takeoff. I was offered the lunch menu for our flight however they insisted on serving lunch at 11 am (origin time) which was 8 am at our destination. There was no question or flexibility of serving the meal even an hour later even though it was a 6 hour flight. As is customary a few minutes before the plane began the initial descent for landing there was an announcement to facilitate those who need to go to the restroom or access the overhead bins before the fasten seatbelt light comes on. However immediately after the stewardess made the PA announcement she went into the only first class restroom there was and stayed in there for 20 mins. No one in first class could use the restroom because the fasten seatbelt light was switched on by the time the stewardess came out. She apologized as she walked by us with her make-up bag under her arm. Given I paid $3600 for this first class round-trip to NY I have to confess that for the first time in my experience with Virgin America did I find it to to be an inferior airline to United.

Every passenger on the flight was treated in the same manner. Cancellation email was received after I've returned from the airport, and the monitors still showed the flight as delayed. AC replied to my claim, stating that they ""don't reimburse delays due to extreme weather"" and offered me 25% discount on the future flights. Please note - the airport wasn't closed, as Porter flight, using the same aircraft type, arrived and left on time. Also, I wasn't offered any alternative and was told that I have to ""get to Sudbury myself if I want to fly from there"", as well as the claim that ""my expenses on the ground will not be reimbursed, because flight cancellation was caused by extreme weather"". I was left stranded for three days, with no explanation and means of accommodation. Not even mentioning I was already avoiding Air Canada, now I will do everything possible not to fly with them again. Unfortunately, they hold monopoly on flights within the country for the most part.

United Airlines,3.0,Adrian Zeno,31st March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Miami. So if I spend first class money, I expect first class accommodations. Purchased two round trip tickets for my wife and I. Both flights were first class. The outbound flight had a wonderful and friendly staff. But I was incredibly disappointed in the food choices. A burger is not an attractive option for a first class meal. Especially one with just cheese as a topping, and no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything. Plus I donâ€™t eat meat, so I was thoroughly disappointed. Worse was the return flight. The seat, tray table and armrest was absolutely filthy. I did not feel comfortable sitting in the seat. It looked like it hadnâ€™t been cleaned in days. Old food crumbs, hair, dust was prevalent. Could not believe United let this happen. I worked my way up in life to enjoy luxury. This ainâ€™t luxury.

Less than an hour after taking off, the captain comes over the speaker to tell us that the cabin pressure system had malfunctioned and to remain safe we had to stay at 10k feet and divert to Cincinnati. We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,M Tynan,22nd July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Madrid. I quite like Turkish Airlines and have flown them extensively throughout the world, in both economy and in the no-longer-existent Comfort Class. This was my first trip, using miles, to fly in Business Class. The crew was attentive, well-groomed and projected a nice, professional image. The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings. No menu, a surprise, and the crew rolled a cart down the aisle showing unwrapped entrees. I selected the fish and sad to say it felt like I was eating a 5TL fish sandwich on the Eminonou dock. The entrÃ©e was very poor quality, tasteless, and cheap. It cost me a lot of miles and a lot of euros to take this flight",,,,,,,,,,,,
Air Canada,1.0,P Butler,1st May 2014,"AC138 Vancouver-Ottawa. Usual AC crush on boarding with lots of people with too much carry-on no enforcement of carry on policy and insufficient space in aircraft cabin design for carry-on seems to be a universal feature of AC that you have to fight for bin space. Cabin crew managed to pack everyone's stuff in. 6 row seating and only 2 washrooms for about 160 people no doubt maximizes AC revenue when combined with overbooking - but no room to move in the cabin two people can't pass in the aisles without standing on the aisle seat passenger. Seats cramped. Flight safety briefings are now followed by full volume ads for BMW and credit card products. Inflight service then began by cabin staff selling earphones. Chose not to purchase later realized this a wise choice in view of limited inflight entertainment options. Food service - if you're asleep when they come round don't worry - if the cart doesn't wake you by banging your elbow as it comes by you will be shouted at until you do wake up and a menu card is wafted under your nose. AC wouldn't want to miss a sale just because you're sleeping! Being now awake looked at menu which offers ""selection of wines"" - turns out this means red or white one brand each. Ordered pieces of stiff cardboard and plastic paid full bar prices. In future AC would have to be the only carrier on a route before I'd fly them again and I would never recommend them.

The lounge at SFO is futuristic but unattractive with an overdose of reds and blacks and uncomfortable seating. Boarding was quick with no problem. The flight crew was aloof and seemed preoccupied. They all wear street clothes. Although well attired - no uniforms? It appears very unprofessional and exudes little confidence. There is no closet for garments. I was told to store my jacket in the overhead bin - really? In first class? Food service was mediocre at best. A choice of two appetizers and two entrees. We ordered the rice noodles main course and as I don't expect anything close to gourmet food the food was cold and inedible. The flight attendant was nowhere to be found although seen frequently during the flight sitting in the jump seat in the galley. Although dessert was included as part of the meal service none was provided.

We flew with United on our last holiday and quite honestly never again. We have flown to many places around the world and United without any doubt are the worst airline I have used. The cabin crew are lazy and somewhat rude doing as little as they can. They could not even ask for the window blinds to be raised when coming in to land at London Heathrow. They did a standard talk when we were on the plane (with a special welcome to our premium and military customers).

American Airlines,2.0,A Battye,21st September 2016,"Flew from Manchester to JFK. The aircraft should have been a 757 but after a delay was changed to a 727. The 757 has seating of 2-3-2 so when changed to a 737 with seating of 3-3 there were not enough seats. The cabin crew were barely polite and you knew they were just going through the motions doing the bare minimum that they had to. After the plane began taxiing the Captain reported that there was a fault with the flaps and would have to return to base where we had to sit on the plane for 2 hours (during which the crew came round with water for the passengers) while they determined that it was an instrument problem and not a physical problem with the flaps so after 3.5 hours delay we managed to take off. As stated before the staff were not exactly rude, just not pleasant and did the bare minimum they had to. The inflight entertainment is non-existant as neither the 737 outbound or the 757 inbound have seat back screens, just the aisle screens which give no choices and showed terrible entertainment. AA must have some of the oldest aircraft in service. I think British Airways have made a terrible mistake teaming up with American Airlines as they certainly do not provide the level of service BA have previously provided.

Aeromexico,1.0,James Neeley,11th February 2015,AM 669 from SFO to Mexico City in Clase Premier / Business Class on January 23 2015. The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing.

United Airlines,1.0,Evan McCarty,17th January 2016,"I took UA742 from Palm Springs to San Francisco. The 1hr 45 mins flight ended up taking 3 hours due to general incompetence from United. Several issues occurred. There was an unannounced gate change that was never updated in United's system. The only indication that we were boarding at a different gate was a paper sign hung by the new gate that said ""SF."" This resulted in several passengers boarding the plane late because they were at the wrong gate. Flight attendants allowed passengers to continue trading seats even after the flight was ready to depart. I understand trying to accommodate families that want to sit together, but once the plane is loaded we should have gotten on the road! Gate agents never asked anyone to gate check, but then (predictably) there wasn't enough overhead space for everyone's bag, so several passengers had to exit the plane, gate check, and re-board, which contributed to the flight delay.

Definitely worth the small extra price over the low cost carrier on this route.

United Airlines,1.0,Felix Klajner,6th August 2015,"I upgraded online in Costa Rica prior to the flight to four premium economy seats for my family, which were in an exit row. Upon boarding, we were informed that since my grandson was only 6 years old, he could not sit in the exit row. This information did not appear anywhere on the United Airlines website. He and his mother were changed to two premium seats in the front bulkhead and we were had to keep our two premium seats in the exit row over the engine, and with no window shades. The noise was unberable, and flying into the early morning sun with no window shade was blinding. The FA dealt with this situation by inserting a flight safety procedures card into the window frame and then a folded newspaper which kept falling out. No explanation or apology for the missing window shade was ever given. We asked twice to change seats, as ultimately did the couple sitting in the other two premium seats in the exit row. We finally received two premium seats but in separate parts of the cabin. When I asked the FA for a can of ginger ale, she responded that she would first have to serve the other pasengers and would give me the can only if she had any left over. Finally she brought me an opened can with a flat beverage. No other beverage service was offered, nor any food for purchase on the 3.5 hour flight. The disembarking in Toronto was at an off-gate location: we descended down a very steep stairs onto the unsheltered tarmac until our suitcases were unloaded, and were then required to walk on the tarnac for 20 minutes to the Customs area. This is not the first time that I have had a totally unacceptable experience flying with United Airlines, the last being in their Global First Class cabin to South America.

United Airlines,8.0,Ollie James,14th August 2015,"This was my first long-haul transatlantic flight and what can I say. Very happy with the flight. The check-in was quick and didn't require queueing for too long. We were onboard and taxiing for take-off in no time. The flight attendants were smiley and happy to help. Food was basic but enjoyable, a choice of chicken or beef. The in-flight entertainment system was a tad dated but had all the up-to-date films and TV shows. Free earphones were handed out at the start of both flights. Unfortunately as we did not book our seats, we were left with the row in front of the exit row which meant we could not recline at all so next time I would reserve them. Having said this, on our return flight, we were in row 40 (right at the back) and the recline was perfect and we didn't have anyone behind us. Taxiing after landing at Newark took a while (no fault of United) and disembarking was a little bit lengthy. Due to the plane being a narrow body (3-3 layout) it made the flight feel a bit cramped, however, as there were 3 of us travelling together, it meant we could all sit together.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,T Eldem,24th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Montreal via Istanbul. Check in at JNB was uneventful. Turkish Airlines uses the SAA lounge which is pretty ordinary but food choices are extensive. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft but was conducted in an orderly manner. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept and the FA's were friendly and spoke very good English. Food and wine quality were good but I would have liked to have a few South African wines. Dinner and drink service was very slow and it took us over three hours to get to desert once we were airborne. The aircraft on the JNB-IST leg did not have wifi and although the IFE had a large selection of movies, it was on the skinny side when it came to new releases. Flight landed on time and with almost every flight we were bussed to the terminal. Spent a few hours in the Istanbul lounge which is well and truly an amazing experience with a very large array of food and beverage offerings. Boarding on the second leg was absolutely chaotic and TK should be ashamed of putting their premium passengers through that ordeal. Once again we were bussed to the aircraft. The second A330 was brand new and the crew and their service were outstanding. I felt pampered throughout the 10 hour flight and was able to catch 3 hours of very comfortable rest in the lie flat seats. The WiFi on the second leg did not work despite the pursers countless efforts to get it up and running. The food on the second leg was superior to the first which likely was related to catering being done out of TK's hub in Istanbul. The flight landed on time but the luggage delivery was slow with priority bags coming out towards the end. Turkish offers a very good business class product on long-haul routes and I would not hesitate to use them again.

Their tickets are overpriced compared to the comfort you get with Middle East carriers. The food is poor. The economy class menu is never changed - you eat the same food over and over again. The food is way below the standard of some other 4 and 5 star airlines. Same goes for the inflight entertainment. Not many new movies lot's of old stuff. And the screens and remote controls are old small and cumbersome. However the crew was as always most helpful and friendly and gave me the feeling of being valued as a frequent flyer and most importantly they got the job done on time.

At check in there was an empty seat in the first business cabin that I would have happily taken had I known an infant was seated behind me. Onboard I called the Chief Purser and complained to her. She agreed that the check-in agent should have told me and was going to follow up. At check in there is no reason why the web-check in baggage drop only counter should be closed before the entire check-in counter closes. I ended up behind a huge family traveling in economy with mountains of bags who checked in at the business counter and haggled endlessly over excess baggage charges causing me to wait about 15 minutes to check in - all the while the web check-in counter was unattended. I had a delicious lamb entree from IAD-DOH although the piece of meat was the size of a silver dollar. New lounge in DOH is pretty nice. I had a shower which was available as soon as I asked.

Emirates,7.0,A Lampard,8th March 2016,"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good. A few grumbles where perhaps they could have been more adaptable but recently flew BA to Barbados and Emirates pretty much topped them in every department.",A380 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to MLE via DXB,February 2016,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Air Canada,7.0,Chaoxian Tian,16th June 2015,"Flew from Vancouver YVR to Sydney NS YQY via Montreal YUL and Halifax YHZ. First segment from YVR to YUL was an overnight flight on an A320. Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6'2"" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself. Overall my first travel with AC was satisfying, but next time I'll make sure I'm not hungry before boarding.","A320-214, E190-100, DHC8-100",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"YVR to YQY via YUL, YHZ",September 2014,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Qatar Airways,7.0,Pierre Barreche,18th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | My last flight from Doha to New York JFK was disappointing. Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed. In Doha, I found food availability and service in the Business Class lounge badly reduced.

Qatar Airways,1.0,R Clarke,16th June 2015,"MEL-DOH-BAH. The journey back to Bahrain from Melbourne was an awful experience. Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board, something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we canâ€™t fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else.

He is travelling to a skiing camp so had excess and over sized baggage which we had accounted for. Check-in at the at the airport is an e-kiosk with no option to use a counter. This is fine if flying is straight forward and you have one bag. I was most unimpressed and sought assistance from ground staff who were helpful. I noticed older passengers who were struggling and thought about families with young children bags prams and car seats and wonder how one person is to manage. The plane was old and the seat uncomfortable and he was served the identical meal on the Auckland and Vancouver legs. Luckily it was good however being hungry he asked for a second meal and was told he couldn't have one - this is company policy. So he went hungry for a 12 hr flight.

Air New Zealand,1.0,V Hunter,6th November 2014,We booked an infant fare with Air NZ for a flight from Auckland to London and had to pay an extra $100 each leg to access a bassinet seat. The infant fare also doesn't include checked luggage which meant we had to spend another $155 each leg for 23kgs of luggage. Compare this to Qantas where both the 'extras' of the bassinet seat and 23kgs luggage were included as part of the fare. Overall we had to spend $255 extra on each leg for an infant to travel on top of a relatively high base fare. When I discussed this with AirNZ customer service they indicated the cabin luggage limit of 7kgs should be perfectly fine for travelling long haul with an infant obviously never travelled with a child.

Aegean Airlines,8.0,D Paraschis,25th September 2016,"I fly Aegean Airlines twice a month on a regular basis as part of my commute from France, where I work, to Greece where my home is. All things being relatively equal, from all available carriers on the Paris-Athens route, A3 is definitely my airline of choice. A few random things, which I'd like to emphasize: 1) Cabin crew are impeccably behaved and presented and always ready to accommodate my requests. 2) Air-fi which was provided on my last flights is quite interesting and compensates for the lack of individual screens in the cabin. I only hope that its content will be constantly updated and enriched (it would be a disappointment, if on my next flight in 10 days I'd be obliged to browse through the same material again) 3) Reserving front W.C. only for business class passengers (typically 8-12 per flight, which is on or about 5% of the plane's seating capacity) does not make a lot of sense and occasionally creates lots of discomfort to economy class passengers. Without undermining the premium service afforded to business class passengers, Aegean could consider a derogation to this policy. 4) As a miles and bonus silver member, I'm looking forward to upgrade to the golden tier soon. As a silver member however, I believe that A3 should reconsider silver tier's benefits and in particular the coupons for complimentary access to business class lounges so that they are offered not only in Greek airports but also to int'l ones as well. All in all my experience with Aegean has been positive since it's reliable, efficient, modern and has by far the most pleasant and professional cabin crew.

Upgrade includes a checked bag a free head set and unlimited food drinks and movies on demand onboard. The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat.

This airline assumes no responsibility for the services that it sells to their customers. Three of us left Palm Springs (flight AA3076) on a beautiful day with hopes of connecting to our flight in Phoenix that was to bring us back to Boston (flight AA2341). Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line. I ran to the gate for flight AA2341 and was told the doors were closed and are always closed 15 minutes before take off. I asked if she could call to see if the doors could be opened and she refused. The plane did not disconnect from gate for at least 6 more minutes. How is an 82 year old man suppose to walk 1/2 + miles to a connecting flight when seated in the back of the plane which takes 6-10 minutes to get out of allowing only 5-9 minutes of walking time (if it lands on time and it did not)? At the service desk rule 240 was not applied which entitles us to the first flight to Boston on any airline not just American which we were forced to do getting us home an entire day late.

I went to the counter, where I was told to wait for an hour until the additional information would be available. When I asked them to re-book my flight, they said that the only option would be to go to Vienna and then to figure out by myself how to get to Graz because most probably the company wouldn't reimburse me the money for the trip from Vienna Airport to Graz. I went back to the gate, got a 10-euro voucher, and was told to come back 45 mins later for the latest updates on my canceled flight. When I came back to the gate, the ground team announced that we were going to be taken to Vienna by a plane provided by a partner company (Austrian) and transported to Graz by bus. This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane. I wanted to re-book and to leave to Vienna earlier but found out that the company would only provide one bus at around 6pm and that theoretically I could fly to Vienna earlier and then wait to everyone else.

Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse was amazing and a pleasure to use. Boeing 767-400 has 1-2-1 configuration in Business Class, but seat is quite hard and very narrow, especially when reclined - it is hard to move when you sleep. Cabin crew was quite young and very friendly. Boiling hot hot towels (some passengers drop them on the floor, as it was hard to hold it). Surprisingly good food, average wine list (I'd expect more American wines), but Delta Sunrise Signature Cocktail was a hit. Excellent dessert cart. Very disappointing IFE - no blockbuster hits, just a few new movies, TV shows I've never heard of - simply, there was nothing to watch. Because of some turbulence there was no second service. Arrived on time.

United Airlines,1.0,G Arnold,12th January 2016,"My wife and I booked a flight on United Airlines from Seattle to San Antonio to attend our sonâ€™s graduation from Air force Basic Military Training. When we got to Denver to change planes, the nightmare began. We were stranded. United didnâ€™t have a cockpit crew (which they described as operational difficulties) and all other flights were already overbooked. We received text messages about every half hour with a new update. This took place for 7 hours and finally at 4pm, United cancelled the flight. Hours later we got an e-mail saying they booked us on a flight the next day, leaving us to miss our sonâ€™s graduation. So at that point, we might as well of gone home. Determined not to miss it, we booked a rental car and planned to drive all night to make it. Thankfully my wife found a flight on Southwest and we made it in time. Today I received an e-mail saying we would be receiving a $150.00 credit for each of us to use on a future flight, with United of course. A nice gesture, but if it hadnâ€™t cost me $522.63 (not to mention approximately 14 hours) to fly from Seattle to San Antonio, I could buy my own airline tickets.

The problems began the day before with computer problems that made it difficult to check in. We all got to the Palermo airport with 2 hours for Check in. There no line to begin Checking in. There was no one to help us. Finally they opened a line for our particular flight, one very long slow line. Staff stood at other desks doing nothing. Finally someone directed people to a second. We were 50 minutes late taking off to Rome. In Rome we got off on the tarmac at one terminal and literally had to run thru the airport to get to our plane to JFK. 7 Members of our group found they had no seats on the plane. They finally got a flight to Boston that evening. Their luggage did not arrive. Their ride home from the airport was at JFK not at Logan Boston.

United Airlines,9.0,Tercon Bojan,15th August 2014,First class on this new 737-900 seems to have more leg room than what I recall from the old first class. Add to that the comfy seats and the experience is quite OK. This 3+ hour flight from San Francisco to Houston had a much improved service - the United staff finally seem to be having some fun and are proud again of their airline. It shows. Besides the service the meals have also improved. There are more healthy choices such as a salad with grilled chicken and fresh toppings chicken wrap and the likes. And then there are those sumptuous warm chocolate cookies that they serve at the end. This flight had not IFE so I resorted to using my iPad and paid for the very inexpensive inflight wifi service.

However, my experience with United Airlines today was highly disappointing not only because of the delay (approximately three hours), but because of the lack of professionalism demonstrated by the staff. Our flight attendant was not apologetic about the long, expected delay at all, but was very rude toward several passengers. One of these passengers included a woman with a baby, from whom the flight attendant grumpily took a purse and roughly shoved it into the overhead. There were no apologies from the flight attendant as we de-boarded, after another smaller delay as we waited for a free gate, and she was not pleasant toward anyone, from what I observed.

Southwest Airlines,,Wanda Cloutier,4th May 2014,This was the first and last time I plan to fly with Southwest/Transair. The plane was dirty and noisy. The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. It was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. I am only 5 feet 2 but I could not even get my legs comfortable. There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. The only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but I can find that with any airline. I will definitely be going back to the airline I have been using for decades.

American Airlines,1.0,Pam Gould,8th July 2014,One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy?

American Airlines,1.0,Stephanie Curl,4th April 2014,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home.

United Airlines,1.0,R Hall,31st October 2014,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward.

United Airlines,1.0,M Raynor,12th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Fort Wayne to Anchorage via Chicago. Worst experience I have had. Maintenance issue on the plane out of Fort Wayne to Chicago, they delayed it twice. The first time they delayed it, we were going to miss our connecting flight so we had to change our flight from Chicago to Anchorage. After getting off the phone the first time, I check my new itnerary and it didn't have my husband and I sitting together after I had told the lady we had a lap child. I called back to explain this again and she said for us to sit together I would have to pay to be upgraded. Meanwhile the flight out of FWA was delayed even further due to a part not coming in, and so I had to find an alternate route. She couldn't find me anything out of FWA that day, so we ended up having to drive to Chicago. Only then, when I told her we were driving did she upgrade our seats for us to sit together. On the way back, we cancelled the flight back from Chicago or Fort Wayne as our car was parked in Chicago. The desk in Anchorage said our last leg to FWA was never cancelled so our luggage was going to be sent there, I asked her to cancel our last leg and the lady at the desk told me I had to call to cancel it myself, and that they couldn't print off a baggage tag to have our luggage end up in Chicago. After being on the phone for 20 mins and the lady on the phone not understanding anything (as they never did every time I called, which was 5+ times) they were calling all United flights to Chicago to check in. So I finally gave up and had our luggage sent to Fort Wayne. I wouldn't recommend flying on this airline if you have a conncecting flight. I wouldn't recommned flying this airline if you have children. The fact that their plane was screwed up due to maintenance and the unhelpfulness of the staff to try and help us get to our destination was absolutely ridiculous. When she couldn't get us out of Fort Wayne on June 28th, the lady on the phone said she could reschedule us for July 30th! I had also gotten up to change my son's diaper in the lavatory. There was a drink cart blocking the lavatory in the front due to the pilots using the bathroom / getting coffee at the front lavatory and the pilot told me I had to use the back lavatory. So I walked back and the flight attendants were about 5 rows from the back with the drink cart, then the flight attendants said I had to wait until the pilots were done to use the front one. I asked if they could push the drink cart back for me to get through and I would wait to go to my seat until they were finished. She said I needed to wait to use the front one, I just couldn't wait up by cockpit. So I held my son for about 10 mins in the aisle before the pilots were done getting coffee to change my son's dirty diaper in the front lavatory.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Wayne to Anchorage via Chicago,July 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

Air New Zealand,10.0,R Connett,13th February 2014,Flew with my business partner AKL-LAX-AKL in Premium Economy on 777-300. Boarding was stress free both sides as we were Premium Economy plus Star Alliance Gold and Koru members so either way we were first on the plane. The flight attendants were available and were there to help right from the start with overhead locker storage etc. Main meals were delivered shortly after take off both ends and the quality of the meals were very similar if not the same to what I've had in business class with each course brought out separately. Quality of the alcohol was good plus it was nice to have a good mug of tea coffee and after dinner mints afterwards. Amenity Packs were the same as in business class. The seat is multi adjustable and obviously nowhere near lie flat but after some adjustment got a nice sleeping position. The seat and footwells accommodated my 6 foot 2 inch frame my only criticism was the footwell that narrows wouldn't accommodate my size 12â€™s so take your shoes off and rest your feet on the bean bag supplied. The crew both ways were excellent. The quality of service was excellent. The seats being pod design mean your personal space is not encroached on I am disappointed to hear that Premium Economy seating on their Dreamliner or the 777-200 upgrades will not be using this type of seating.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

I'm really sorry but this is not what I want to hear. If Operational problems are beyond their control, then what is within their control? So they rejected any compensation, eventhough I missed my connection flight in Singapore, I had to spend one night in Singapore instead of taking my connecting flight to Denpasar, Bali.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,4.0,Paul Beardshaw,10th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam. When an airline has so many lost luggage claims that after 45 days, your claim still hasn't been started, you have to ask yourself ""Is KLM the right airline to fly with?"". I have no complaint about the the planes, the staff or the on board experience, they're all pretty good. Where this airline fails is when they delay your flights because of missing catering, lose your luggage, smash that luggage and I lost some valuables. All of this happened to me in one flight. Trying to get their customer care team to acknowledge my claim and begin the investigation is proving to be more difficult than landing a vehicle on Mars. The day after I arrived back, my luggage arrived at my house and it was broken beyond repair, and missing several items. As I write this, it's been 45 days since I made first contact about this, and my claim is still sitting in a pile of claims, waiting to be started. Each time I call, my claim is being ""escalated to a manager"", only to find out the next time I call that this didn't happen. I've had every excuse available and not their staff hang up when I call. I have to use my colleague's mobiles so the support team does not recognise my number. If you are planning to book with KLM, only do so if you are only taking hand luggage with you, and you're prepared never to make a claim against the airline for anything else because, it's highly unlikely they will process your claim. The biggest frustration is, I enjoyed flying with them, it's just their Customer Care team that letting the airline down.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam,June 2018,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no

Qatar Airways,7.0,Gordon S McDougall,13th July 2014,As frequent flyer from Azerbaijan to SE Asia and Australasia over the last 15 years I'm delighted that Qatar now fly from Baku cutting out the change in carriers. Lounges: Very poor. GYD DOH and BKK are not pleasant. Emirates leave you so far behind in pre-flight care. Boarding: At both GYD and DOH when flying to GYD it is a scrum. No pre-boarding for BC and very little interest in premium passengers until we're onboard. I pay a lot of money for my flights and I expect a little bit more than QR provide here. Inflight: Staff are great service excellent movies and videos don't change often enough and food is a big problem. Many customers have been traveling for a long time before the airport and when you put us in a lounge where the snacks/food is atrocious we are looking to be fed onboard. To wait six hours for a breakfast is ridiculous given that you only provide a snack after boarding. All in all not bad but some of your rivals really are so much better in many aspects. At least you provide genuine BC seats in the short haul sectors unlike some other carriers.

American Airlines,3.0,C Rasmussen,18th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Freeport via Miami. Absolute poor experience from end to end. When we checked in, the boarding passes didnâ€™t work when we entered security. Our re-check-in was done with an attitude of me not understanding how things work - which isnâ€™t very customer service minded. After we arrived at our destination, 2 of 3 checked in luggageâ€™s missed our flight (we had 2.5h layover) and was not found until the day after. Neither of these experiences were managed well, and no one (!!) from the additional assistance during check-in (and re-check-in) to the baggage service representative (via phone) had any empathy or a customer service mentality. Please note, we were traveling with an infant. On the way back to our home, we experienced an unpleasant situation while boarding the first airplane. We were kindly asked to check in a carry on at the counter, and we explained that our carry on had baby equipment required for a long layover (blankets, harness etc.). A classical superviser-type (by attitude) employee from AA interrupted the conversation, without any respect of existing explanation (or emphathy for that matter), and ordered us to check in our carry on. If we did not, she told us we wouldnâ€™t be allowed to board the airplane. â€œNext flight youâ€™re taking is at 6PMâ€ was her exact words. This was said without even trying to solve our issue! It contributed to the unpleasant situation we experienced at the gate. Worth mentioning we were flying with carry on allowed as part of our ticket. We unwillingly gave up our carry on (incl. important baby stuff) only to discover that half of the overhead bins were empty when boarding was complete. I am frequently using AA for business trips - itâ€™s though no longer my first choice when other options are available. Participated in the post flight questionnaires provided by AA.

In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the ""conditions for sale"".

I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,S Simpkins,3rd October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Newcastle to Venice via Amsterdam. First time with KLM and a pleasant experience. Outward flight in Boeing 737 was delayed for 25 mins because of early-morning fog at Schipol, and arrived similarly late. Aircraft clean and comfortable, although would prefer non-reclining seats for these short-haul flights to prevent interaction with inconsiderate passengers in front. Good connection at Schipol onto Embreaer 190 - what a nice little aircraft this is! But take-off again delayed owing to air traffic control, and landed 30 mins late. Return journey had 737 for both legs. Delayed again leaving Venice, but flight to Newcastle on schedule. Aircraft staff very pleasant and efficient, although would prefer some imposition of rules on cabin bags as too many oversize bags on board, greatly reducing the available locker space for those of us who observe the rules. Small snacks dispensed on all legs of flight - very welcome. Nice experience - will certainly use KLM again.",Boeing 737 / Embraer 190,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newcastle to Venice via Amsterdam,September 2017,3.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,yes

It's also fun that I physically couldn't put the seat divider between him and myself because he took up two seats and was sitting on top of me the whole flight, while I practically sit in the aisle way.

United Airlines,3.0,R de Haan,17th March 2014,Travelled to Mexico with a family of 5. United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse. I have flown United before without issue and were extremely disappointed with the airline on this trip.

American Airlines,3.0,D Liveris,11th January 2015,On flight from Austin TX to Manchester UK on 12/21/14 - paid for the additional leg room which could be better but was ok however the seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever. The more leg room you get the narrower the seat gets! 8 hrs in a cramped seat is ridiculous. My husband and I had seats 15a & b and left the armrest up between us to give us room for our arms the passenger in seat c I am thankful to say did the same thing. Seriously removing rows of seats to gain additional leg room is one thing but reducing seat widths to cram in more seats is in my opinion the most ridiculous idea they ever had. The staff were not the best and a little on the rude side. I have flown AA every time I had flown to the UK but I am considering a different airline for future trips due to the seats mainly.

Trying to get the attention was impossible and, after many extremely rude directives to go back in line, finally one man told us that travelers to Canada (and Canada only) were to go to the international area. With all our luggage we went just to find another single line for all. When we asked about the business class line, we were told (very rude again) that was the only line and that we had to get in line, regardless of what ticket we got. After a good amount of time, we were booked by a rude lady who was more interested in our luggage weight than giving service. We were told that this only happens with flights to Canada because we don't have a reciprocal visa system. We went to the lounge which is old, and in need of repair. Seats are broken, food is bad although the drinks were ok - the worst lounge we ever visited. The boarding was chaotic and the service onboard minimal, no courtesy and once dinner was served, the flight attendants disappeared. Our luggage, tagged ""priority"" was not in the first batch and our fragile tagged box came with the luggage and not sent to the proper area as it should happened.

Air Canada,7.0,M Charson,8th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s! I just wish they would quickly get rid of their new baggage fees for long-haul flights.",A330 / Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Geneva via Montreal,January 2019,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes

In fact, we never actually ended up flying and did not make it to our destination. We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control",,,,,,,,,,,,
Emirates,2.0,M Ness,24th February 2015,Flying Perth to Manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip (facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg). On arrival at Dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a 'no' - not every one has a fancy phone with internet service!

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,J Gasimna,26th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Kuala Lumpar to Amsterdam in a code share with MH due to its attractive flight times and the ability to fly into HUM in the UK, transiting through Schiphol. Boeing 777-200 with new slimline seats. Having now experienced at first hand this seat I can only agree with the many reviewers that the closeness to the passenger sitting next to you is just too invasive. What I did like was its firmness and especially for taller passengers the vertically extendable headsets for good support but it desperately needs to be a few centimeters wider to win over my seal of approval. Even the so-called Economy Comfort seats (not to be confused with Premium Economy on other airlines) are only a fraction better as the added comfort might be in length and recline but not in width. Immensely appreciated the mixture of young and older stewardesses and top marks for the way they interacted with all passengers during the flight. On my two trips the pursers were situated in my section, whose professionalism I greatly enjoyed. And one of the stewardesses was working on her last flight before getting married. This was with great fanfare announced by the captain followed by a guest appearance of one the off-duty pilots to congratulate her in person and making himself available to answer questions from passengers. Usage of the inflight entertainment system was easy and had a good selection of new, recent and foreign movies that I was able to catch up on. A few notes on the preparation of the trip, it was disappointing not being able to bid for an upgrade to business class as stated on the KLM website for the legs. Oddly enough, on this leg some business class seats were available to which I happily would have made a competitive bid.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kuala Lumpar to Amsterdam,April 2017,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8.0,A Zalewski,13th June 2015,"This was my first experience with Aeroflot and I was pleasantly surprised with the airline. In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers. While I had a problem free flight, I saw a number of other passengers struggle to sort out problems with ground staff at the SVO transfer desk.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,IAD to WAW via SVO,June 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,yes

Aegean Airlines,6.0,M Allegra,15th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew 4 sectors with Aegean Kiev to Heraklion via Athens and then to Belgrade. The level of service is consistent. Warm meal served on the flight from Kiev (2 hours). Candies distributed before departure which is a nice touch and certainly doesn't cost much. Legroom is better than Air Serbia due to thin seats. On the flight to Belgrade we were served a sandwich which was at least twice bigger than its competitor on the route, but as much lower in quality. It was basically a bread-bun. All in all I would recommend Aegean, the main downside being the ATH airport which is very unfriendly and has no proper space or rest areas for long-transits. Polite and attentive crew. Attention to detail and consistent service. No IFE, nice legroom and a good meal on longer flights. Boarding in ATH 80% of the time being done at remote stands like low-cost carriers, even in cold and windy weather. Luggage policy seldomly applied, at some stations strict one-bag policy as Wizz Air / Ryanair, at others no one pays attention. No proper business class. Poor quality meal on shorter flights. ATH airport makes Aegean unattractive as a transit airline making for poor transfers if the wait time is longer than a few hours (very frequent in winter). Reaching Athens to spend a night can also be very expensive and time-consuming (distance to the city being 45 kilometers).",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,KBP to BEG via ATH / HER,November 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,yes

United Airlines,4.0,Daniel Mitchell,25th December 2015,"I have mixed feelings about United Airlines. The few upsides of the flight from San Francisco to Boston were the fact that it was direct, cheap, and punctual. Also, for some reason, I was able to use Wifi without paying. However, I was not impressed with the cabin service. We started off the flight with an announcement that there was something wrong with the plane, which is never good news to hear. My seat had a disgusting stain and felt like cardboard. There was no complementary dinner even though it was a night flight, and the price was very high. The inflight entertainment system was nonexistent, and the flight attendants did the safety introduction the old-fashioned way: acting it out in the front of the plane. Unfortunately, I was in the back. United is a so-so airline, one that should be avoided unless it's the cheapest or the most convenient.

Air Canada,1.0,Michelle St-Germain,11th July 2014,"I had booked a trip from Ottawa to San Diego with United Airlines. The flight I had to Chicago from Ottawa got cancelled due to weather conditions and I accepted an alternate route through Air Canada which I regret doing. The airplane sat on the YOW tarmac for over an hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in Toronto. Only good thing I can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed us to get out of our seats while we waited. On my way off the plane in TOR no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure I could make my connecting flight to San Diego which was showing ""on time"" on the flight board. After passing customs baggage check etc. the flight was no longer showing on the flight board. The AC flight attendants I found roaming around had no clue where to direct me. I happen to find the service desk and was told to get in line even though I said my flight was leaving in 10 minutes and I simply needed the gate number. As there were 4 people in line my flight had left by the time I received ""service"". So booking another flight to get to San Diego I opted for a layover in Los Angeles that night instead of waiting another 24 hours in Toronto. I was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in Toronto nor Los Angeles even though Air Canada caused me to miss my flight. Staff member told me he could not give me the boarding pass for the next days flight but omitted to say he did not complete the booking and that I was expected to go to the AC ticket counter at LAX to get one. I only got the customer service contact information when I returned to the desk to confirm my flight to San Diego was in fact the next morning at 9.55. After a short night in a close by hotel I returned to the LAX airport the next morning. I went to US airlines who had no trace of my info who redirected me to American Airlines I found out that there was no ticket for me as the booking the TO agent did not complete the booking. The agent in Toronto said he could do nothing for me because the notes on file said I had accepted LAX as my final destination. Told I needed to speak with a ticket agent at LAX to see what they could do for me. I walked from American Eagle terminal 4 to Air Canada terminal 2 and back. I barely made the 11.30 flight. I hate to think what would have happened to my baggage had I any with me on this trip.

American Airlines,3.0,Rachael Majdali,2nd March 2016,"I flew from Los Angeles to Miami for vacation with American Airlines and this flight was a bad one. The plane was painted in the new livery, but don't let the new exterior deceive you. The interior of the plane was outdated, as the seats were very uncomfortable to sit in and looked like they were from the 1990s. The trays were difficult to fold back into place once you unfolded them, and some even had scratches and ink marks from over the years. The lavatories were showing their age and were disgusting. The only entertainment sources of entertainment you had were magazines, the window, and what you brought on the plane. They had TVs on the ceiling, but they only started playing a movie in the last hour or so of the flight. The cabin crew was the best part of the flight. They came around a few times with beverages and snacks, and they were dedicated to doing their job. There was barely any turbulence, which made the flight very smooth. The people on the ground were also nice, and boarding was organized. Overall, I would not recommend flying American Airlines.",Boeing 767,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to MIA,February 2016,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,10.0,Russell Conyers,22nd December 2014,Give credit where credit is due-on the 16th of December I boarded AA193 in First seat 3E to connect in JFK to AA1416 to BDA also in First seat 3E. Due to a technical fault we had about an hour delay in BOS and I was concerned that I (and my fellow connecting passengers) would miss our connections. The captain did his best to make up time and after arriving at the gate (12) the lead flight attendant asked passengers not connecting to remain seated and let passengers with connections to disembark first. My BDA flight was at gate 40 and I made the fligh t- with moments to spare! Upon arriving in BDA was very surprised to see that my 2 bags had also made it.

Air New Zealand,10.0,Mark Gibson,14th January 2014,MAN-LHR-LAX. Flew Christmas day from Manchester to LAX via Heathrow using Virgin's 'Little Red' service to Heathrow then onto LA using ANZ's premium economy 'spaceseat' product. Check in at Manchester terminal 3 was quick and painless our bags were checked in by Virgin and went through to LAX even though our main flight was with ANZ. After arriving at Heathrow and checking our gate number it was time to board. I find that ANZ excel in this area in PE. We were boarded as priority passengers right after business class. In their PE cabin its essentially just economy with extra legroom whereas I find ANZ really do differentiate with their premium customers. Onto the plane and as always its spotless I am always impressed at the friendliness of the cabin crew and the spaceseat itself. Yes this seat does not fully recline but this is not a business class cabin and more importantly is not a business class price! After a smooth take off and tasty dinner (both my partner and I opted for the lamb and it was very tasty) it was time for a few glasses of wine before they dimmed the cabin lights. I have seen comments that say drinks can take a while using the touch screen service. I usually just go and get my own drinks in this case the flight attendants are more than happy to let you pick anything you want. So a few glasses of wine later and a decent sleep and the cabin lights are slowly brought back up to full before breakfast is served. Finally we arrive into LAX 30 mins ahead of schedule. Once through immigration our bags are already waiting for us as they are labelled 'priority' and so are one of the first off the conveyor. If you are expecting a business class seat (i.e fully flat) then ANZ's 'space seat' isn't for you however neither is the price. I paid just over $1600 for my return ticket and at that price this flight was an absolute bargain. Compared to anything else that's out there the ANZ's premium economy cabin is head and shoulders above its competition both in terms of the product itself and the quality of its staff. Its just a shame they don't fly to more destinations as I believe the only thing keeping BA in business is their routes it certainly isn't their service based upon my last trip in PE with them. If you are taking the long flight from the UK to LAX and have a few extra dollars to spare then go for this flight it makes an unbearable experience (11 hours in a metal tube) actually pretty fun!,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

While the seats are more-or-less simulated business class and the entertainment selection is quite good the service quality is the worst in my 35 year experience. The ""flight attendants"" apparently come to work only to qualify for free travel as they most certainly do not go out of their way to provide anything approaching ""service"". The meals and drinks were delivered with all of the passion one expects when one of these veterans delivers the FAA pre-flight announcements. I despised making any contribution to wages these people did not earn. Given a choice between United and Aeroflot I'll likely choose Aeroflot.

Air Canada,1.0,S Jensen,17th May 2014,"Toronto-DC-Toronto in mid-May and paid the $25 per bag fee for checked baggage. Too many ""economy-minded"" passengers didn't want to pay this reasonable fee so opted to bring over-stuffed bags onto the flight as ""carry-on""s. One woman with such a bag PLUS a large backpack so large it could not fit under the seat. These people were not directed by AC staff to check their bags the consequence being that there was insufficient in-cabin overhead bin space causing a delay in boarding of over 20 minutes. This caused us to queue on the runway for over half an hour waiting for clearance from air traffic control. The result - we left DC around the time we were supposed to land in Toronto. Contacted AC regarding this irritation and received an email that the wait-time for a response is twenty working days (yes that's a month!) If I phone to make a complaint the wait-time in the phone queue is anywhere from 35-55 minutes. This was my second AC flight and the second time I was delayed by inefficient staff.

United Airlines,1.0,Kathlyn Oliverio,13th April 2016,"Our flight from Chicago to Boston with United Airlines was unacceptable, from start to finish. To begin, our flight was changed at the very last minute, and our seats were changed/not assigned. We called the airline immediately for information, and the only information we received was that they were unable to do anything until we were at the gate, forcing us to go to the airport much earlier in order to figure out what was going on. Once we arrived, we were misinformed about placing ourselves on the standby list in regards to the fact that we were even able to be on the list with checked baggage and we would be provided a refund. When we asked about what would happen to our checked bags, we were then forced to be taken off of the standby list, thus, not using this service. The service quality while on the flight was not horrible, but the service leading up to the flight was not acceptable. Once we were charged for the standby list, the service we received was even worse. We were told that we would not be able to receive a refund, and then told we would have to submit a request online. All of the individuals we spoke with were rude, confused, or both. If you are adamant about flying with this airline, please do yourself a favor and understand everything that you need to have before/during/after your flight (checked bags, times you need to leave by, WiFi which is NOT included, etc.).

United Airlines,8.0,Neil Ramsay,7th November 2015,"Check in at IAH was quick although we were overweight 1lb in one bag and were forced to transfer a jacket to the other underweight bag. I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs. The toilets were kept in reasonably good condition the whole flight. Seating in economy is tight and becomes a little hard after some time but you get what you pay for.

Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly.

United Airlines,1.0,Stephanie Sipe,30th January 2016,"What a disappointment. I regularly take United Airlines flight from Eugene to San Diego which connects in San Francisco. Typically there is only about 15 minutes to get to the connecting flight in SF before the plane takes off. Today, my dad took this same flight and has been waiting in the SF airport for 8 hours because the plane from Eugene was a few minutes late and the flight to San Diego left without him. Since United does not offer vouchers for ""weather related delays,"" my dad was pushed behind about 20 other people on standby to catch another flight to SD, even though he was one of the first people to be placed on standby because the other people apparently paid more for their tickets. What a joke! After not being able to catch 4 more flights out of SFO, he is still stranded. This trip was a gift for my dad to come and see me and now he has had to spend most of it sitting in SFO airport, watching other people on standby get on flights to SD before him because they paid more for their ticket. Why can't United Airlines partner with a ""sister"" airline, to accommodate these kinds of absurd incidents where their guests are left stranded at the airport? Also, why would United regularly plan for only 15 minutes to catch a connecting flight in San Francisco of all places - an airport that is famous for weather related issues?

It wasn't a full flight and I had all 3 seats to myself so could lie down made the 16hours leg comfortable. Plenty of drink runs and the food was very good albeit a small quantity but it was spaced well so I wasn't hungry throughout. Attendants were attentive but some seemed disinterested and cabin service can get disorganized at times. ICE was great but did not use much and noticed its the same contents as before. Seemed like catering out of DXB was of poorer quality hence the return from LAX is better. Transit at DXB was good arrived in the evening so not a lot of people. DXB-DMM was a hit and miss food was very good or a 1 hour flight but cabin crew was very disorganized and always on a rush. Landing smooth and communication from the cockpits was ok.

As soon as I got through security, the departure board was now showing a delay. There were no weather issues whatsoever. The flight was rescheduled to depart at 11.35 am, and the gate had changed. Within minutes of arriving at the gate, the gate changed again, then again. The flight was then pushed back to 12.05 pm. Two hours past the scheduled departure time, we began boarding the flight. Not one American employee apologized for the inconvenience or explained the delay. I was miffed. I understand the American employees staffed at O'Hare were not to blame for the delay, but it would have been nice to recognize the delay was a huge inconvenience. Two days later, I received an email from American, asking me to review my flight from O'Hare to BWI. It was laughable. They couldn't even get my itinerary correct to review.

American Airlines,1.0,D Marton,23rd August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | In flying from Sacramento to Kansas City through Phoenix, (Date: 8/12/18) our flight was delayed by an hour and a half which forced us to miss our connecting flight in Phoenix. We immediately went to speak to an American Airlines representative, who told us that they were likely not going to be able to get us into Kansas City that evening. What they could do is get us into Phoenix, to which they could put us up in a hotel for the night, and we could fly out the next day (the 13th). Seeing this was only realistic option we had we agreed to stay in Phoenix for the night. As we waited on the flight to arrive from its delay, once we got on the plane, the flight was then again delayed, this time due to weather in Phoenix. After about 20 minutes the flight was then cancelled. We got in line to talk with another American Airlines representative to see what we would need to do for a hotel reservation to stay in Sacramento for the night, as we clearly were not getting into Phoenix. We were then told that they were not responsible for hotel accommodations due to inclement weather. Had we known that the flight to Phoenix was going to have weather trouble we would have taken the flight into Charlotte, or we could have looked at another Airline flight. I asked if I could speak to a manager and the representative told me I would need to go online to file a complaint.. The Customer Service Representative wouldn't even sit us together on our flights for the next day. We were assigned separated seats and when we asked if we could sit together, we were told that we would have to pay a premium for upgraded seats (There were multiple open seats at that time, many of which were not first class). All and all we spent about 7 hours in the airport that day We both ended up having to take an additional day of work We had to pay someone to watch our animals for an additional day We had to pay for a hotel in Sacramento We had to pay for dinner, breakfast, and lunch before we got to fly out the next day (8/13) We had to pay for transportation to the hotel from the airport And we had to pay for an additional day of parking in Kansas City On top of all of this. I have had to call and plead my case (three separate calls) to American Airlines ""Customer Service"" for over two hours on the phone. I have spoken to three different â€œCustomer Service Repsâ€ and 2 different managers. After a week of not hearing from American Airlines I decided to call back. This time I was told that they could not find the complaint that had been filed by Lou and that if I had a formal complaint I would need to file it with the online form (https://www.aa.com/contact/forms?topic=CR#/). This whole ordeal has cost me an insurmountable amount of time and stress at my job to take care of, almost 3 hours I have been on the phone. On top of it all, I had a device (Nintendo switch) that fell out of my laptop bag on the flight home, valued over $400, now lost. I have notified American Airlines of the lost item as well, both in Phoenix and Kansas City, to which both referred me to the online portal to submit for lost items. I will not being flying with American Airlines ever again, and I will be sure that my company, colleagues, and family are informed on how poorly this company treats their customers for when they decide to make future travel arrangements.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Kansas City via Phoenix,August 2018,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,10.0,Robert Harrison,8th October 2015,"I recently traveled four long haul flights (London to Bangkok return via Doha) with Qatar Airways, and despite the fact I was both severely lacking sleep and rather hungover on each occasion, I found that each flight was was up there with some of the most pleasant flights I have had the pleasure to be on. I usually fly Business and or First class but on this occasion I had decided to travel to Thailand at extremely short notice (roughly 3 hours), so therefore my business partner accidentally booked tickets in economy. Which is not usually my preference when taking a flight. Yet I could not find fault with the level of service I received on each flight and in particular the flight QR9 from Doha to London, was simply exceptional. I cannot thank the cabin crew of Qatar Airways enough for making what could have easily been a set of nightmare journeys for myself. In the end, amazing. If you are considering booking with Qatar Airways and find yourself somewhat hesitant due to having read some of the bad reviews, I would ask you to consider the fact that when It comes to reviews of anything you can be almost certain that they tend to be completely polarised viewpoints. And as such you should treat them with a pinch of salt. Go with an open mind, you'll probably find your flight just fine. Or allow yourself to enjoy it despite little problems and you might, like me feel the need to write a review because it was such a great experience.",,Business,Economy Class,LHR to BKK via DOH,October 2015,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

They are much more narrow than they look. I'm a big guy at 6'2"" 235lbs and just getting into my seat I found it an impossibly small space. With a small personal item under the seat there is zero space. Thankfully during flight I could take it out from under the seat and it was not so bad. The crew for this flight mostly male with a single female serving were on top of their game. The Red inflight system for entertainment and ordering was brilliant.

They politely advised in advance when they would shut down the ordering service so people could get last requests in. Flight was only a few minutes delayed in departure and landing.

Once airside, boarding was not announced until 13:45 and flight departed at 15:00. There were many Emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. Clearly Bangkok's gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of A380 passengers and it was jam packed. No effort was made by the Emirates ground staff to separate passengers. Boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. Once on board, cabin crew was cold. The lady responsible for the area I sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent English when distributing the 'meal' (tasteless and cold curry chicken rice) and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley (Diet Coke for example), the request would fall on deaf ear.

Some slight improvements since they ""lost"" our luggage years ago (and almost had to be sued for compensation) but still a 2 star airline. Boarding usually a shambles exacerbated by people flying with pets (dog fights at gates comical). Also people travelling with too much carry on causing huge delays. It isn't such an issue in other countries I'm not sure why such a problem with US airlines after having so many years to address the problem,. The real entertainment is usually the cabin crew, who I am sure are mostly nice people, it is just that their standard of training and presentation takes the joy out of the entire experience. Whilst all flights were pleasant enough, just walking onto a plane to see two poorly dressed flight attendants standing with their backs to you eating, instead of greeting customers is so bad it's hilarious. And it was the same for each of the seven legs we took over these three tickets. Apart from that the flights offered a variety of mediocre experiences from airplane condition to not being offered headphones in first class, but that didn't bother us as much as the dreadful presentation and complete lack of pride and professionalism. We only fly AA for the status credits to keep our Qantas Platinum (Oneworld Emerald), I hope that AA's recent image overhaul is still underway and better training standards on the horizon. Note - there isn't a Oneworld lounge at CUN and AA will not check your bags beyond USA, even though we were connecting to another Oneworld airline in biz class - Qatar (talk about chalk and cheese).

American Airlines,1.0,D Verdin,23rd May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Denver to Buffalo. I'm not one who is usually compelled to write a review but the service I experienced this weekend flying on American Airlines was so horrible that I had to. It all began when I believed I left my debit card at the ticketing counter when I paid to check my bag. After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is. On top of it, my bags were lost and I received them the day I returned back to Denver. I paid for extra seating and another ticket and they still will not refund me. Never flying this airline again. It blows my mind they can still operate.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Buffalo,2017-05-01 00:00:00,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Jetblue Airways,7.0,S Harrison,3rd October 2013,We traveled between July and September 2013. My friend travels with a portable kidney machine. I notified them of this fact when I made the reservation by computer. I was told he could bring the machine and another medical bag for free. When it was time to board the plane they took everybody except the disabled persons first including children in strollers. I think a person with a kidney machine should trump a child with a stroller for boarding. When we got onto the plane I asked one on the flight attendants where we could store this somewhat heavy kidney machine. She promptly told us there was no room to store it other than the overhead bin. I told her I couldn't lift this machine over my head. Another flight attendant and the disabled person lifted it into the overhead. On the return trip we just decided to check it in.

Once on the plane we waited 20 minutes to depart but then the captain spoke informed us that the plane had been fuelled with too much fuel so we were going to have to wait 15 minutes for the de-fuelling process.

We have flown round the world with various airlines, but this was the first time with Emirates.

We spent twenty eight hours on four flights and the staff did everything they could to make us comfortable. The check in staff were friendly and the process swift and easy. Their uniforms are smart and professional. Boarding was simple and, because there were three gangways, one to upstairs, it was quick. The A380 is quiet. The food was very good. The lighting onboard was perfect. During night hours it's a dark gently blue ceiling with twinkling stars. At dawn, it is exactly that. The entertainment system. Three external camera views and one little oddity that I found a complete Godsend. On the music section, I found a sleep hypnosis track by Anna Rowe. My mistake was putting it on ""repeat"" because some way into it, I had gone. But then when it started again, it woke me up! The seats were comfortable and a good non-intrusive recline. The usual cushion, blanket, headphones etc. If you bring your own headphones/noise cancellers etc, make sure enough bring the double-plug airline adaptor with you because their headphone sockets are dual-plug. You can use your mobile, get data and charge devices. The plane has its own mobile service for you to connect to, watch out though, it's not cheap, so best to go on airline mode in case your phone auto-cones and someone rings you from home.

Additionally, are telling me my only option for me and my girlfriend is that we must purchase two new tickets (with no refund to our originally purchased tickets). This would be adding an extra $400 to my trip cost because they moved the flight time to a new time that conflicts with my schedule. Naturally, I called customer service for them to only continually repeat that they cannot refund or provide me with another flight without buying new tickets. Despite my best attempts to ask other questions, I was interrupted nearly every time I tried to speak.

The massive queues to board the aircraft long queues at check-in and the scramble for the baggage at LAX airport will deter me from choosing this aircraft in future.

Of all the sectors I flew the food on EK 650 First Class from DXB to CMB was the worst. The curry sauce which accompanied the rice tasted like chillies mixed with water.

The food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable - especially the selection of movies. It was an overnight flight though so I didn't use the system much. The cabin mood lighting during ""sleep"" periods was also relaxing. On the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and I could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. Admittedly I was travelling in Economy class but I have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. Unfortunately the Emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and I was only able to doze fitfully. The other thing I was disappointed with was the service. Emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events (such as meals DFS etc). I used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. However they did not do so. The service was also not the friendliest - though that could probably be due partially to the timing of the flight when the flight crew are undoubtedly tired too.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Steve Shanahan,16th January 2016,"Philadelphia to San Francisco, and United Airlines boarding system is archaic and ridiculous. Don't pick an aisle seat or you will end up getting on last and there will be no overhead space for your bag. When I was boarding, the Group 3, 4 and 5 lines were lined up for a long time since no one pays attention to this system knowing that they're going to get screwed if they try to get a bag in the overhead. I was a 5 and when our turn came, they suddenly announced that everyone (1/5 of the passengers) had to check their carry on bags at the counter because there was no overhead space available which caused complete chaos. After going through security and always getting x-rayed and patted down for no reason, facing this boarding madness feels like torture not to mention the long flight ahead. I did pay for the extra leg room but you get no priority boarding for that - you're just like the people who pay nothing extra. The crew look miserable and I can't say I blame them and the passengers seem sullen and depressed after the regimen they've been through. If companies like United Airlines want to encourage repeat business, they're going to have to realize that you can't treat people like animals and sometimes you might want to give them something to comfort their stress in flying - not even peanuts - they're so cheap.

United Airlines,1.0,H Parker,25th March 2015,I had my first and hopefully last experience with United Airlines this past week. I flew round trip to Orlando with a friend for spring break. Our flight down was delayed three hours because of weather which is admittedly not United's fault however we missed a connection in D.C. and had to fly standby on a later flight that put us at our destination 6 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane. They then cancelled that flight after leaving us sitting for two hours while they tried to find another aircraft. At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby. I was booked on a confirmed seat to Albany for Saturday morning and tried two standby flights Friday night. My friend made it out but I ended up in the airport overnight (I was not offered accommodation). When I went to board my flight Saturday morning they informed me that there had been an error and the flight was overbooked. I was bounced from that flight and booked on one departing in the afternoon. The afternoon flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems and I was unable to get out until Saturday night at 11 pm. After all that they refused to even consider shipping my bag until I had landed in Albany (it had been shipped to Burlington on Friday). It is now Monday and I still have not received my bags. Their customer service is unfriendly unhelpful and refuses to let you speak to someone in charge.

Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person.

I knew about the very short transit, therefore consulted the cabin attendant when I found out that the flight was delayed. To which I was told the connecting flight would wait for me and I would be guided to business class just before landing so that I could get off the flight early, in which case the transit would be smooth, and there will be ground staff assisting me the transit. All points was a total lie! They could have, and I do have experience with other flights that the departure time is delayed by 30 minutes or so for connecting passengers, however no such arrangement was made. Neither did they allow me to go to the front of the plane. Rather, I was moved twice to the rear end of the plane due to families wanting to sit together. On top of this, none of the ground crew were there to help me at all. Because of this, I was forced into staying 24 hours in Moscow in a hotel arranged by Aeroflot. But this is the crazy part.

American Airlines,1.0,A Owen,17th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I would not recommend American Airlines to anyone. They had me stranded in Charlotte after lying to customers for hours about our delayed flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte. First it was weather related then an airline steward was ""missing"" but on her way which was the reason given for the prolonged delay, at that point it had been already 2+hrs. We finally boarded at 1am, sat there only for them to say the flight was now canceled with no valid reason. The Customer service agents were absolutely awful. Best part of this all is they tell us there are no flights to Charlotte until 10.45pm the following day which was also a lie, they would not offer hotel comp stating that it was weather related delay and they were not responsible for it. So we board a flight to NY, then to Boston get here only to be told that my luggage is in Charlotte and it arrived at 7am, somehow my luggage got here before I did.

These were the two single best flights in my many years of long distance travel. The newest business class seats (the plane was 3 weeks old) now have plenty of storage space under the foot rest. The service was friendly and very helpful (repeatedly checking in on our needs, smiling, energetic). The food was top quality (as good as a decent restaurant). Lie flat seats that are quite comfortable. This product far exceeds what you get on United, Lufthansa, and Air France to Europe out of SFO and tends to sell at about 40% less money than these other carriers. My only complaints is that drink service tends to be a bit neglected (e.g., if you want a second glass of wine you are going to have to ask for it, no one will offer).

Flew from Incheon to Birmingham via Amsterdam. The new cabin is much improved however I was lucky enough on both inbound and outbound to get the single seats - I would have been very unhappy climbing over a seat mate as an individual traveler. The seat itself was very comfortable and I slept well. The major disappointment was the IFE the resolution on the screen was so poor it felt 20 years old and I couldn't watch for very long. Service was adequate but slow and sadly the food was rather boring for business class considering it was supposed to have been designed by a top Dutch chef.

I told the lady that the guy standing right there directed me here, and that it says Alitalia right there, then she pointed out that its what's on the TV. So we go in this long line & wait. We get to the counter, & the guy starts talking to another man (which seemed to be a supervisor). We thought that maybe he was being trained so they were talking him through it, but they kept talking and laughing. We waited for awhile before I asked if there was an issue w/ our tickets. Then, he calmly says, I can't find your tickets, you'll have to go to the help desk over there. I told him we didn't have a lot of time because we had already been directed to the wrong line & that our info was right there. He said I can't help you. So we go over there & there is about 8 people in front of us & only 1 person working at that desk. I'm starting to panic at this point because I didn't want to miss our flight, we had even came really early! I tell my bf to wait inline while I go back & see if someone else could help us because it seemed like this guy didn't know what he was doing at all. I ask a man standing up front to help because we are running out of time, he directs me to the same guy that we just dealt with - I tell him we are going to miss our flight, he says you have plenty of time. I couldn't believe how he was treating me. I was so frustrated, I had to walk away. I went back to my bf & told him, he went to the kiosk to see if he could print them while I waited inline. I get up to the lady tell her he couldn't find them, she calls over to him, writes something on the paper & says go back over there & they will take you right away.

So I turn & rush to get my bf from the kiosk & she starts yelling at me to go back to that desk & I told her that I have to get my bf, then she says ma'am you don't have time!!! (I know we don't have time!!) So we go back to the man to get our tickets & we cut the line like she said to. He refused to help us right away, so my bf says are you guaranteeing that we will not miss our flight? He says yes & then I think he worried so he stopped helping the other people & got us our tickets. We had to run to get to our gate. we barely made it. Then the boarding lady was taking bags because there was no room & gets into it with this elderly couple because they refused to give her their bags, because they lost their bags last time. She was not understanding at all, they ended up not letting them board, instead of letting them keep their bags.

Emirates,2.0,E Dorler,23rd October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Perth to Manchester via Dubai, returning from Paris. We have traveled with Emirates Business Class many times in the past and although not perfect, we have never had cause for complaint until now. We traveled to Manchester from Perth on 4th September 2017. Our flight to Manchester was uneventful. However, the walk (including train) to our connecting flight (EK19) was horrendous. It took at least 30 minutes to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Considering there is no significant layover time between flights, if the incoming flight from Perth had been delayed, we would have missed the Manchester flight. Another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. Many UK ex-pats live in Perth and would have been connecting to the Manchester flight, why was this flight from Terminal 1 and not terminal 3? The experience on our return flight flights was even worse. The service and food on the flight from Paris to Dubai from 30th September 2017 (EK76) was unacceptable. Food was cold (soup) and a steak that I ordered was uneatable. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Seats were also very uncomfortable. Once again a walk and train for our flight to Perth (EK424). When the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. I have had a better embarkation experience with AirAsia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of Emirates reputation. The flight arrived in Perth over an hour late, obviously due to the embarkation process. With the exception of the return flight from Dubai to Perth (EK424) food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. The business class lounge in Dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. The highlight of the flight was the food and service in the Emirates Paris Business Lounge. It is a shame that Emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. We travel Business Class to Europe at least once every year and more often than not with Emirates.

I booked a paid first class seat for myself and then a day before my trip my son decided he wanted to come with me, so I paid for him to travel along side. I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin. As it was a short flight I ended up downgrading myself also as my son is only 8.

Plane was very quiet compared to the 777 a bit more clumsy on take off and landing though! I think this is more plane design issue. Food was outstanding.

The staff onboard that day were excellent we had the back seats just beside the staff and each one of them could not have made our flight more comfortable. Being our first flight to America and travelling with our youngest son who has autism it was quite a worry but the staff made him and us very comfortable.

Myself and my wife prefer travelling with Emirates, due to their flexibility around routes out of Manchester and previous experience of flying with Emirates from London Heathrow and Gatwick via Dubai to Mauritius. The meals in Economy class have deteriorated in my view. The portions are much smaller and needs reviewing by Emirates. I purchased $1 of wifi access, and its reliability was poor at times, and cannot be relied upon. On a positive note, we flew on the new 2 class Airbus A380 (A6-EOP) and the flight was good (with the exception of meals).

First leg with Airbus B77W was ok, seat is much more comfortable than 2nd leg A380. Our first flight was delayed an hour in LHR, we were quite concerned we would miss our connecting flight only one hour in Doha. Spoke to two cabin crews, they said there was not much they could do. After landing in Doha, there was no boarding gate so it took a while to reach the departure hall by bus, there is an information counter outside where we came in, however staff weren't being helpful apart from telling us we needed to be fast. The ground staff knew there were about 50 passengers on our flight that were late for their connecting flight, without any help on the ground, me and my husband along with 50 passengers had to run from gate D2 to B3, this was 3 kilometers in distance. The most disappointing part was the food. Pie after pie from Bangkok to London, on the way back the food was even worse. Overall, I wouldn't fly with Qatar again.","Boeing 777-300ER, A380",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to BKK via DOH,June 2016,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,no

Air Canada,5.0,Hammond Josephine,27th April 2014,AC855 on 4th November 2013 from YVR to Heathrow London. I returned on AC854 27th November 2013. Breakfast as the last meal on the plane was a real come-down. It should leave passengers with a satisfied feeling glad they chose Air Canada for their journey. Instead a piece of cellophane-covered yellow cloggy sponge slice that tasted of nothing paired with a small sweetened yoghourt. It was such a sad and disappointing closure to my trip. Regarding the holding pattern over Heathrow it was amazingly beautiful but that only made the unpleasant breakfast experience worse! My seat would not move one millimetre but was pronounced broken as soon as I explained the problem. The flight attendants were excellent.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,no

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,6.0,S Roz,26th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Tel Aviv to Tokyo Narita via Moscow in Business class, returning in Economy class. Tel Aviv to Moscow in a Boeing 777-300 in Business. Comfortable seats, nothing out of this world, crew very polite and friendly, especially the ladies. The males seem more reserved. Cultural thing in the Russian service industry? The cabin was almost empty, but attention was lacking, apparently there were two VIP passengers onboard, and the crew gave them most of the attention. I had to ask for water twice. Most Airlines supply you with a bottle of water to begin with. Lunch service very long and food portions and quality average at best. Transferring in freezing Moscow (-6c) by bus to the Narita bound aircraft, no special bus for business passengers, its ok by Aeroflot to pay 5000usd per ticket and to sit in a frozen crowded bus for a long time. Onboard a charming welcome as usual, but business seats in the A330-300 too hard, an extra mattress is needed like many other airlines do these days to increase comfort. Dinner service took long (3 hours from take off to finish) leaving us with 6 hours to sleep, but wake up call (optional) for breakfast is 2 hours before landing, leaving passengers to sleep 4 hours or give up breakfast. WiFi for a fee in Business is unreal. Purchased a 10USD package that expired before one site could be up. Waste of money. Didn't use again the whole trip (4 segments). Return NRT-SVO-TLV, the first portion again on A333 but in Economy! My request to have four seats for myself and my 11 yr old son, so he could sleep was answered by ""we are completely full"" - so moved us to a two seater by the window. After takeoff I counted at least 10 rows of 4 seaters with one or two passenger at the most. So much for telling the truth. The agent could have blocked the seats between us, and release them for others if need be. For someone who paid so much for those tickets, I expected more cooperation. I asked to check an upgrade fee, but the ticketing agent took over an hour to calculate the difference in fare, but failed to come up with a confirmed rate. We gave up, as we wished to eat and shop, and didnt fancy waiting so long at check in. Was that rocket science task? Onboard crew less friendly than the usual, seats painfully crowded and very little padding. Food was average again ,most Japanese around me left the food untouched. IFE ok, but sound tracks in bad quality, with much background noise. One cabin crew smashed her trolley against my knee, very painful, but except ""sorry"" nothing else. Moscow Transit was OK, and a packed Boeing 777-300to TLV. SU joined the misery club of 3-4-3 seating in economy, simply the worst. You keep rubbing shoulders and arms against a stranger, thank god it was 4 hour flight only. On a longer one it would have been a nightmare. Crew this time friendly and hard working, its really the ""shining star"" of Aeroflot, but the hard product must improve to make them attractive. IFE on B773 excellent, a factor to make you forget that you are a sardine. Food good.

The irplane is not a restaurant. Food is a + but my values are on the seat comfort more. Seats were comfortable. Service was very efficient and fast. I also liked the dimmed cabin.

The flight out of Montreal departed on time. The small Embraer was in very good condition and the short service and snacks was enough for this short flight. Connecting through EWR from Canada is not an issue as immigration is pre-cleared, so I headed directly to the lounge. The food offerings are not that great and the lounge is crowded, but drink variety is good, lounge is clean and service very good. I have mixed feeling for the second leg of the trip: the plane was not very new, but it was clean and well maintained. Cabin crew were very friendly and nice",,,,,,,,,,,,

Emirates,4.0,Ravish Thomas,19th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Emirates has lost it's edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress. Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions. Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers. One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters.

American Airlines,1.0,T Barden,19th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Our flight this evening was delayed 4 times over 3 hours due to bad weather in Chicago. At 9pm we were informed that our flight had been rescheduled for 9:30am the next morning. I understand you can't control the weather, but by this time there were no other flights leaving Raleigh (or the surrounding area) until at least 7am the next morning. I had an important event to attend in Chicago the next morning. When I approached the agent you could tell right away that she didn't care. I tried to find an earlier flight from a nearby area or even just one that got me close to Illinois. I offered to drive from Raleigh part way to catch a flight or even drive from outside Chicago a couple hours...if she could just get me close. The response I received was that my request was too difficult and required too much work on her part. I then asked if there was someone else who could help me and she said I was free to go wait in line again for someone else who might be more willing to spend the time assisting me in getting to my destination. (point to note: there was no one behind me in line) I was frustrated and started to break down into tears (that's how important this event was) but all she did was pick at her nail polish and repeat the phrase 'you will not be making it to Chicago by tomorrow morning.' She then proceeded to tell me that I was not eligible for a hotel voucher because I was not based out of Raleigh? Well played. I travel a decent amount and have a lot of patience for people dealing with travel issues. Travel delays happen and I accommodate, but this time I really needed to get somewhere and American Airlines missed the mark. The least she could have done is shown a little compassion but no, I was treated like I was there to serve her needs as she saw fit. Would it have been so hard for her to ask someone else to help me? Apparently the purchase of a ticket from American Airlines doesn't include basic kindness for the ticket holder.

Line up through security was long and slow due to only one lane being open (obviously not United's fault but still frustrating). United flight to and from Winnipeg are seldom on time and either delayed or cancelled probably about 70% of the time. It was no surprise to me that it was delayed an hour and a half. Ended up landing in Chicago about 2 hours late. On the way home mobile check in worked and the whole experience was positive. Got to the gate and seeing my flight was on time was too good to be true and it was. It moved gates and was delayed 40 minutes. Both flights were on an E145.

We had booked JetBlue for our return flight and had arrived on an international flight so had 7 hr layover. Another clue that I should have picked up on, the enormous customer service line located at the JetBlue gate area and the number of people that were crying. After waiting 5 hrs for our scheduled flight we were advised 2 hrs prior to departure that our flight was canceled. Waited in line 1.5 hrs for the agent to tell us they had no available flights for our family of 5 to to get out of New York until 3 days later - no compensation for accommodations - there were cots in baggage claim to sleep on and, in addition, this airline does not work with other airlines to look for other travel availability - only what is available in the JetBlue system.

Flight coming back was a nightmare. They delayed our flight for no real reason (weather was perfect, plane was there and fine ... we asked multiple people and nobody had an answer). We then waiting on the tarmac for 1/2 hour .... right in front of an open gate. No reason. Because of these errors on their part, we missed our connecting flight in Mexico City. Customer service was awful. Iâ€™ve never been treating so poorly and it was their fault we were in this inconvenient situation. Their best flight they could do for us was the next day - 20 hours out. We asked about different airlines, different airports to fly into, or at least accommodation for our family (a baby and 2 other small children) to go to. They just kept shaking their head no. It was horrible, and we had no choice but to take our exhausted babies to a hotel and feed them and let them rest for the night. All hotels within a 1/2 hour hour radius are well over $300. And we were not even close to being the only ones who missed flights due to their errors and their claims they had nothing until the following day (even tho this was at noon). It made me wonder if they were in on it with the hotels and purposely doing this to their customers. They made us miss obligations back home, they turned a hard 6 hour travel day with little kids into a 26 hour travel day, and we are out over $400 for their short comings and inconvenience they brought onto us.

On boarding I was offered a choice of drinks and a hot towel. Post take off drink requests and meal selection soon followed. I was asked if I knew how to use the seat controls and given a demonstration - a first for me.The staff were helpful, cheerful and courteous and the meals superior. The seat was outstanding in terms of comfort and it was made into a bed using a memory foam mattress that gave me an extremely comfortable 7-8 hours sleep.

Air Canada,2.0,M Hirst,18th February 2016,"I flew with Air Canada using Airmiles and it was a dismal experience. On the flight there, the food took 2.5 hours to make its way down the plane - extremely painful as it was right around dinner time. When we arrived in Toronto, the baggage took almost an hour to arrive. On my flight home, they overbooked it (the third flight in a row that they had overbooked that evening). The person at the gate was rude and impatient when explaining the situation to passengers who had paid to be on that flight. In my opinion, it is ridiculous to overbook flights, and it should not be the norm of an airline's practice. The flight attendants were harried and frustrated (understandably), and the airplane took off 25 minutes late. When I arrived in Calgary, the baggage took a long time to arrive again, the belt stopping several times even when bags were on the ramp, making it so passengers could see their bags, but not pick them up until the belt started moving. My two main issues were with the overbooking, and the way the way the gate person addressed people who were trying to find out whether or not they would get on the flight. Reprehensible customer service, I will not be flying with Air Canada any time in the foreseeable future.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YYC to YYZ,February 2016,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

Lufthansa,10.0,Peter Bailey,8th June 2016,"Edinburgh to Malta with Lufthansa. Never flown with them before but needed a return to Edinburgh and this was the only option. Transfer time was not enough at under an hour at Frankfurt as it is a huge airport but luckily the next flight was delayed anyway due to bad weather in EDI. This is an airline like they used to be, good food, friendly staff, comfy seats and lots of leg room. Only got a sandwich as short flight but what a sandwich, free tea with a cold drink also and refills as needed. Every thing on both flights went like clockwork with true German efficiency just like Aldi but with Waitrose quality. The food was handed out quickly but politely and the real clincher was the rubbish was collected at just the right time so as not to leave you with the tray down for ages. Even my grandchildren at 11 and 12 travelling with us were impressed. So on our many trips planned to Malta it's Lufthansa or bust, cost won't come into it but will allow at least 2 hours for transfer as can't gallop these days at over 60.

The customer service here needs serious improvement, for example today I asked a flight attendant if there was any room left in overhead compartments for my carry on (even though this is still 7 minutes or so until boarding ends and all of the compartments had been closed early) very kindly and politely and the response was completely rude and dismissive to my question she told me ""that can comfortably fit under your seat, in the most condescending offensive tone"" well I am a 5'10"" woman whose knees already touch the seat in front of me and would like to be able to enjoy my flight. She acted like it was too much to ask and so I then had to be uncomfortable unnecessarily on a flight that I paid for. So instead of arguing about it, as it was not worth my time and energy I then said forget it and then just bitterly deal with it the rest of the flight.

We came to the airport and found that we need to take another flight, which was delayed and we couldnâ€™t make connection from Toronto to Quebec on time. We had to spend 1,5 hours to find another ticket and it was just the beginning of nightmare. Our flight was Premium Economy, and the ticket was changed to economy without any refund or explanation whatsoever. I had a fracture in my spine and metal rod was installed, that was the reason for Premium class and a window seat, so that I wouldnâ€™t suffer from pain. Instead we were seated by the toilet in economy and I had severe pain through the flight and a day after. When we finally got to Toronto our flight to Quebec got delayed and we had to wait another 2,5 hours. We got there eventually, but on the way back it was the same story. Our flight got delayed, we did not make it to our connection flight and on Dec 30, 2017 we got stuck in Montreal. Air Canada provided accommodation after an argument, but we had to take an extra flight to make it home on December 31, 2017. Thank you Air Canada for screwing up New Years for us.

Had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage.

United Airlines,3.0,Vitalij Zabelo,18th February 2015,"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not.

We missed a connection because the crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before, so we were forced to take one at 8am, which meant waking at 4.30 am. We arrived at the airport, boarded, and were taken off the plane as it did not pass inspection. The flight was then cancelled and the next one was at 8pm, arriving home at midnight. We went to the customer service desk with all 300 other passengers but decided to go to another customer service desk. The agent was nasty and sarcastic to those in front of us, and to us.

Our flight out of Aspen was delayed due to rain, which is normally for an Aspen Denver flight, however every person on the flight had tight connecting flights. The crew knowing many passengers needed to get off, would not open the door off the plane for 22 minutes. After majority of the passengers now need to run to the other side of Denver Terminal B (and for those who donâ€™t know thatâ€™s close to a mile) we are told our plane will be waiting for our bags to be put on before take off. They were not. Not even put on the next flight, they will be arriving two days after our arrival. United so kindly asked us to pay for their drop off as well.

American Airlines,1.0,Gary Davis,15th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Denver to Quito via Dallas/Ft. Worth. So we planned an awesome trip to the Galapagos and made the mistake of purchasing plane tickets to Quito Ecuador on American Airlines. I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning.

American Airlines,1.0,Fred Mertz,24th June 2016,"American uses dubious business practices when booking tickets. I booked tickets for a family of 4 weeks before the flight date. There were no available seats at the time except for the upgraded seats at premium prices. I checked daily for a month and no seats opened. I hoped to get seats when we got to the airport. When I checked in online 24 hours pre-flight, I checked seats again. Surprisingly there were 42 empty aisles and window seats now available. American wanted to sell out the middle seats first, then make you pay extra for an upgraded seat rather than make all the empty seats available. We got 2 aisle seats and 2 window seats in the same row. The plane was extremely small and the seats were closer together with less legroom than any of the other 7 carriers I've flown domestically this year - by a lot. When the seat in front of me reclined I had no room to read my iPad without propping it on the top of the seatback in front of me. This made for a very unpleasant flight. Further - all the cabin overhead lights were turned off for the entire flight. It was a red eye but there was no option to turn a light on if you wanted to. Whenever a passenger opened a window blind they were told by the flight crew to close it. This was supposedly to allow people to sleep (because nobody sleeps on day flights obviously) but in effect it minimized the work the cabin crew had to do since everyone was relegated to darkness and had little reason to ask for anything from them. The worst airline and the worst flight I've ever taken is an impressive one-two punch. Avoid American at all costs. I'll never fly them again.",,Business,Economy Class,LAX to BOS,June 2016,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1.0,no

Needless to say that my pre-booked seat was gone and I had to endure with a leftover seat for the next 7 hours. Flight was 100% full due to the other cancelled flight. 777 not nearly as comfortable as the A380 in terms of space, comfort, noise and dryness of the air. Service was average and rushed. Lounge at Doha airport very crowded as always during peak hours. I left after a while because lines even for the toilets were building up. They should really consider getting another lounge.

Air Canada,2.0,R Wilcox,30th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Tokyo to Denver via Vancouver. Tokyo to Vancouver was an uneventful flight as you want flights to be. I have no issues with the plane or service on that flight. My issue came in trying to go from Vancouver to Denver. At the last minute Air Canada cancelled our flight. Okay fine. Things happen. (There was no issue with weather in this case.) I'm not upset that the flight was cancelled. I'm upset at how it was handled by airline representatives. First of all, there is no customer service counter for the airline in this part of Vancouver airport, so the entire flight is waiting in a giant line for a mere two representatives to help us rebook. Second, they start handing out a phone number because they said it was faster for us to rebook if we called this number. This is true, and I did call. However, why are they making already frazzled customers do this? Shouldn't they just employ enough agents to handle this sort of thing? As a side note, when I called the number the woman on the phone was very nice and helpful and took the time to answer all my questions. Third, did my rebooking over the phone, and the agent was very helpful. However, she can't issue me a boarding pass or check me in over the phone. I have to see an agent. She assured me that my baggage would follow me, perhaps not on that same flight, but eventually. I'm on my way home, so I'm okay with this. Fourth, I try to see said agent. If I can get a new boarding pass with enough time, perhaps I can get go get my baggage and get it retagged myself. I have no such luck. I can find 3 Air Canada reps in the entire airport (or at least the part I have access to without going through US customs again.) All 3 are trying to help with rebooking. I wait in line while my husband wanders the airport looking for a person or a kiosk or anything. He finds nothing. This is where my issue is. The woman trying to rebook everyone literally will not even let me finish a sentence. She says I have to go get my baggage and go through customs again with it retagged. When I tell her that the agent told me over the phone that I would not have to do this, she rolls her eyes and prints me one boarding pass. I need two boarding passes. You see, our new flight was from Vancouver to Seattle and then from Seattle to Denver. The final Seattle to Denver leg was on another airline. She refuses to print me that boarding pass and sends me away with a wave of her hand and will not answer any more questions. I go to the gate where we are supposed to take off from Vancouver to Seattle. This agent also will not print me another boarding pass. Here's how that exchange went Me: I was wondering if you could print me a boarding - Agent: No. The flight has been downgraded. I don't know if you have a seat. Me: Okay well - Agent: Sit down and I'll page you. (Not sure how she was going to page me without asking my name but what do I know right?) She pages customers being bumped to the next flight. They are unhappy naturally. She is just as snippy with them, not letting anyone finish a sentence. We do make the flight and eventually get home over 6 hours late. We have no bags. Of course there is no Air Canada representative in the Denver airport to speak with. Our final leg was on Alaska Air. I make a lost baggage report with them. I've been on hold with Air Canada the entire time I've been writing this review.

Southwest Airlines,6.0,Tim Pitman,6th January 2016,"Ontario to Sacramento. This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations. He then stated, ""Sorry but there is nothing that he can do"". He didn't even try to make it right but rather tried to come up with different excuses. Also he knew very little about the policies as I was placed on hold several times while he consulted with another co-worker.

The plane we were on from Atlanta to Las Vegas a long flight had no leg room and there were two large men and me in a row! On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there!

Once we were in the air, we landed early in Detroit and United Airlines had no instructions. We were only told to get off the plane and wait for instruction. After an hour of waiting they came to a conclusion that there would be another flight the next day. United did not help with any accommodation for a place to sleep in the night for any of their customers. When I checked into a hotel that I was forced to pay for, other people staying at the hotel had vouchers from the Amarican Airlines company because American Airlines cares about where their customers go to sleep at night in the event of a flight change or delay. The day of the flight there was no representative seen at the desk gate D10 from the hours of 7am-10.30am. There was no one there to talk or help any customer until the time of boarding.

Alitalia,,N Yanaky,25th June 2014,My parents and I were returning from a lovely vacation in Italy to Toronto on June 1st 2014 when we discovered our flight AZ650 from Rome was delayed over 3 hours. We were not offered any advice or meals and only found out from talking with other passengers that we could get a meal provided to us for our long wait. We were not allowed to choose the food we felt like but were limited to very limited selection of very bland overcooked pasta. When we finally got on the plane we were shocked at its condition and that it felt very uncomfortable. The upholstery was all worn the seats were cramped and my mothers seat even had her arm rest duct taped! When the television screens came down (unfortunately not on the backs of seats) our screen was flickering and full of static so we could not see the safety video at all. When the movies came on we discovered that both my mothers seat and my seat did not have working sound systems so we could not hear any movies. The screen continued to flicker so much that not only could we not hear the movie but we could even see the movie. A flight attendant came and folded the screen back up and said it was not working. For 10 hours my parents and I were crammed in a middle seat row with no sound or movies to watch. This was unacceptable. Our row of seats was in the middle (unfortunately) and had bathroom doors at either side so we continually heard the slamming of doors. The food was awful so surprising from an Italian airline. Our seats were also the most cramped I have experienced and I am a small person. It was a disappointing end to our vacation.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,P Trealader,3rd October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dar es Salaam to London via Istanbul. I was on an overnight flight from Dar es Salaam departing at 03.25 to arrive at Attaturk Airport at 10.25 later that morning. The plane was an old model and the seats did not recline completely. Sleep was not easy. One of the stewardess's in the business section could barely speak English, was unable to make herself understood and spent a lot of time opening & shutting overhead compartments in the business section, making it difficult for me to sleep (I was in seat 2B). My problem arose at Attaturk Airport when, only having a 2 hour layover, I chose to go to the business class lounge to relax until the connecting flight to London. However, I fell asleep and woke 20 minutes before take off. What I hadn't realised was that the gate was a 25 minute walk from the lounge and though I ran I made it to the gate only to be told the gate had closed, that I would need to go to the information desk to get another ticket for an alternative flight to London. When asked for instructions to the information desk, I was given incorrect information as to how to get there. Every member of the ground staff I asked told me a different direction, and were most unhelpful. Eventually I was told I needed to go to the transfer department - again given incorrect directions. Finally when I spoke to a member of staff there, he told me I had to go to the ticket office as he could not issue a ticket for me. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the ticket office. Back to information, who told me I had to go through passport control. When I got there I was told I needed a visa. Why? After all I'm airside, I'm not leaving the airport - no one had the courtesy to tell me that the only place I could buy a new ticket was outside the transit area. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the visa desk. I purchased a visa that cost me Â£20, went through passport control and eventually managed to find the ticket office. Again, I was met by very surly ticket office sales staff who were most unhelpful and who tore up my boarding pass & suggested I would have to pay a further Â£1050 for a business class ticket or Â£435 for a single economy ticket. She suggested if I wanted to try to buy one cheaper, I could do so online. When asked what the Wi-Fi code was, I was told there wasn't any. Having no alternative but to buy the economy ticket, I was then told to go to the incorrect check in desk! Standing in line for ages, when I got to the desk, I was told I had to go to 'C' section. Finally I came across the one and only helpful staff member, who understood my predicament, was sympathetic and helped me through the process of locating my luggage (which had obviously been off loaded from the original aircraft I was supposed to be on) and assured me it would be on the flight I was now booked on. I was aware that I had a restricted ticket and would therefore forfeit the ticket for a no show, or cancellation etc, however, what I did not expect was the rudeness and unhelpfulness from Turkish Airlines ground staff. I certainly would never book with Turkish Airlines again. It was a nightmare.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,DAR to LHR via IST,September 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Mason Panos,3rd July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Where do I begin, before booking this flight from Portland to San Francisco with United I looked through the baggage policy online to make sure I was able to take carry on and personal item. Website showed nothing saying I couldn't. Upon check in I was told that we were unable to take a carry on and would have to pay $25 dollars per bag to be checked. So there went $50 dollars. Let me add how rude every employee I met for them was! Absolutely no help or care in the world. Then we get to the gate and I see almost everyone bringing on both. With normal amount of overhead bins in the plane. So there is absolutely no reason for them not allowing carry on bags.

The customer service was terrible. I am not sure they even know what it means. The stewardesses had a very arrogant, superior attitude which I found just low and disgusting. As they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves.

Lufthansa,9.0,Tizian Dey,19th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Frankfurt. Solid flight overall. Flight departed not on time owing to the weather conditions at Dulles, but Lufthansa and German Air Traffic Control managed our flight to land on time. Seat comfort was nice with plenty of space left for my knees. Nonetheless, my seat was broken and therefore it reclined all the time which was awkward for the person sitting right behind me. Flight crew was outstanding. They did their job always with an extra smile and I told one flight attendant about my damaged seat and he dealt with the situation and offered me a new seat, which was fantastic. Food was okay, which was also down to me as I am not fond of Camembert cheese. Drinks were available all the time in the galleys and also offered by the crew throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment offered plenty of films in several languages which was a nice touch as well. The only thing bad about this flight was a rude female passenger next to me complaining about me going to the loo twice at this 8 hour lasting flight, but that is not Lufthansa's fault at all!

It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy.

Iâ€™ve never seen people treated like that in my life let alone in airport related problems. When one woman from AA was â€œdoing her jobâ€ and asking people if they needed help with anything she would listen to their questions and then be so patronising and unhelpful that it then put people off asking her questions as they feared to be verbally abused by this member of staff. The attitude from the AA staff on the desks as well was unforgivable, they had absolutely no urgency and not a single iota of warmth.

Most ground staff donâ€™t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English.

Also, Iâ€™d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out.

Really disappointed to realise that the airline I was once proud of has fallen behind the competition. The aircraft was late on departure both ways of my trip. The seats are too close to each other and too narrow (30 ins pitch as LH). The food was unacceptable for a Greek airline that represents the country with the best cuisine in the world, both ways of my journey exactly the same food and each time worse that the previous one. Cabin crew professional but with attitude and poor training, Night flight and they left the lights on throughout the whole flight without dimming them, announcements were too loud and hasty (especially in English), asked for water twice and they forgot it both times.

We will reset the seat and see what happens - it got stuck half way to lie flat. We changed seats off our own back but the only seats available together were in row 26 infront of the rowdy men's pub area (inflight bar). If you want a peaceful flight don't sit in the rear section. It's like lying down at a party. The food service started - they took our orders early on but oh dear, our choices weren't available.

I was traveling to the states for Thanksgiving weekend and was delayed 3 hours on my first flight due to ""late inbound aircraft"" and again for my connecting flight another 2 hours due to the same reason. Looking back the last 4 times I have traveled with United this has been the reason. There was no weather leaving Montreal or Chicago. Then again on my return flight I was delayed 2.5 hours and 4 hours on my connecting flight. When I finally got to my final destination at 2 am after 12 hours of traveling which should have taken a total of 6 I waited 45 minutes for my checked luggage. When I asked why we were waiting for so long the United representative told me there were two flights coming in from Chicago and they wanted to put the luggage out all at the same time. I've never heard of this happening and several other passengers and I thought this was unreasonable. Our flight landed several hours late why should we have to wait even longer for another flight to land deplane and unload their baggage.

No gate so exit in severe snowfall and winds people in flip flops and t- shirts as this was from Thailand. Shipped on buses finally to terminal in utter chaos as all flights were cancelled. Thousands of people and only 3 TK representatives to help. Took into hotel at own cost rebooked tickets next morning via phone. Then headed for airport again flights cancelled again and no help anywhere and of course thousands of angry passengers stranded. TK head office is a place of shame that gave absolutely no help actually the sour lady just said no and then called for next in line. Result 2 days in IST from own pocket. Flying business and being star alliance gold gives little in this company when it matters. Even refused to be rebooked on other flights. Needless to say last flight IST-ARN was 1h late boarding commenced without communication between gate and crew so business passengers and others too stood 20 min outside of plane door watching crew clean the cabin and stock the food. Quite embarrassing. Was planning another flight with TK in business to BKK but my money goes from now to other carriers.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,no
American Airlines,6.0,Michael Chen,1st August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | This New York to Manchester flight was taken on 25 February. The check-in counters at JFK Terminal 8 can be confusing for the uninitiated. Checkin was done at one station, while weighing of checked in luggages and the drop off for the luggages were at some other stations. While the queues at each station was short, it nevertheless required some effort, patience and time to figure out which was the station to get to first, and then negotiate the crowds to get to the next stations. There were a fair amount of confused travelers wondering where they were supposed to get to. I would rather stand in line for the usual check-in counters which handle everything from check-in to luggage drop-offs. The cabin crew were busy getting everyone settled at the start of the flight. They were friendly and there was lots of interaction with the passengers. I had pre-selected a seat at the back of the aircraft but was asked by the crew if I was willing to take an exit row seat somewhere in the middle of the aircraft.

I reached there at 19:57. The guy who was at boarding counter told me that gates are closed. I told him how is it possible as I have the boarding pass and still there are 23 minutes left. Then he asked me to go to the transfer desk and assure me they will help me in this matter. I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high. When I paid the entire money and have nothing left out I asked them I have no money left for anything to eat. They told me they will provide food every 5 hour - once i got the new ticket and after 14 hour I reached them and asked for food and they denied even for tea.

Lufthansa,4.0,Sid Vinyard,28th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrÃ©e selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival. Apparently ""priority"" bag tags have no meaning at LH. 2 flights were 3+ weeks apart, but entertainment was identical in both directions.",A380,Business,Business Class,Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt,2018-05-01 00:00:00,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

My flight was scheduled to leave on a Sunday but was cancelled with no reschedule until Tuesday. They have strict internal policies that do not allow them to upgrade / book other airlines if they have an opening. This is primarily driven by American Airlines not wanting to pay the difference in cost. Instead they decide to put the passengers life on hold in a poor hotel for two days. Note the delay was not weather related, but a maintenance problem with their aircraft - they should have a better back up plan. One day delay is acceptable- two days is not! In some cases passengers were delayed 3 days. Also note there are no exceptions made, even if you have a medical issue. Also the front counter attendant was extremely rude.

Air Canada,3.0,M Keane,20th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Paris to Newark via Montreal. The check-in process from Paris CDG went smoothly and the flight and service were operated by a courteous and efficient crew on the first leg of my flight (CDG>YUL). Following U.S. Customs & Border Control, there was a delay in flights into New York due to weather. After a small delay, our flight (AC885 @7:55pm) boarded anyway. Following another two delays of about an hour each on the tarmac, the captain announced air traffic control in New York was cancelling all flights for that evening. It was already 10pm, so there were no flights after the weather cleared up until the following morning. The cabin crew was very kind and helpful. They wanted us to get home as soon as possible, but since they couldn't do that were handing us bottles of water and pretzels during the delay and apologized as we de-planed. That said, everything following was a nightmare only exacerbated by the unhelpful staff at the check-in desk of Air Canada in Montreal. Because our plane was canceled due to weather, they handed us each a brochure detailing their policy on inclement weather. While they could not comp a hotel room, they said they would reschedule our flight for the following day. Because I booked through United, however, I was not receiving email notifications on the status of the new flight, and could not see details on the Air Canada website because I could not find the reservation number in the confirmation from United in my email. It was getting closer to midnight at this point and, understandably, the staff is on overtime and wants to go home as much as we did, but they were only grouping about to speak in French (which I understand and speak fluently) about the customers being difficult. I understand their hands were tied with the flight situation, but they were discouraging customers standing in line to rebook their flights with the booking staff because ""everything would be processed automatically"", but they did not even want to help me navigate the website to find my tracking information. Since my ticket was a United ticket, they figured I was last priority. Finally, in this time waiting, they just brought out a small cart of ginger ale and other sodas. I had to specifically ask one of the staff for water (which there should have been a stock of for situations like this). Overall I would say the international leg of my situation went smoothly, but I would avoid using this airline in the future for how little they seem to want to do about rebooking clients on missed flights.

The day before my flight I discovered I was only getting one boarding pass. My husbands flight booking was under a different conf #. This would be fine however the united miles plus card no longer applies to him, therefore he looses priority boarding AND United took it upon them selves to change our seating assignments to where we were no longer seated next to each other for 14 hr flights. I have never had my seating changed by any airline after choosing a seating assignment if they ""cant be guaranteed"" there is no advantage flying United over Southwest aside from paying more money. They had availability to accommodate to economy plus but of course wanted more money. we had to change flights adding a 4 hour layover and pickup arrangements just to sit next to each other. No wonder United ranks so poorly in customer service. I will avoid flying this airline at all costs in the future, its more important to try and suck another $300 out of a customer than accommodate and make it right. I will also be canceling my United Plus card as it serves no benefits. It does us no good to travel together if only one person on the card gets priority.

United Airlines,9.0,R Gibson,21st May 2014,"Rome to Newark (EWR) in Business First departing at 9:50 a.m. We were lucky that we could use the miles we had accrued with the United Mileage Plus card for this trip and were very happy with the flight. United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music.

United Airlines,4.0,E McCarty,17th January 2016,"I flew from Chicago to San Francisco on one of United Airlines many daily flights between the two hubs. It was a typical United flight: delayed by an hour, no sense of urgency as plane was being boarded. Seat comfort was fine. My power outlet couldn't hold a plug without it falling out constantly, which made doing work difficult. A few things I did enjoy : pretty good customer service, effective internet that priced by the hour (which was a bargain for me, because I only needed to use it for a couple of hours).",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to SFO,January 2016,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no

They are the least reliable airline I've flown with. Seems like everything they do puts you one step behind on your trip. My flight home to Ottawa they had us wait 2 hours well they tried to fix the door of the plane. After that amount of time they game up and got us to another plane. This new plane had a faulty cockpit seat so now we're blessed with another 2 hour wait. Could have been home 2 hours ago now.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,M Sheikh,20th January 2016,"Me and wife flew Turkish Airlines from Toronto to Lahore with a layover in Istanbul. The plane from Toronto to Istanbul was a little cramped for legroom, which was a 3x4x3 setting. I can't sit for very long and had to get up a few times and there was very little leg room to stretch my legs, my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me and I am not the tallest guy under 6'. Entertainment system was nice though, nice big screen with a lot of variety, the earbuds the airline provided are terrible for fitting, so just use yours with the adapter they provide. Touch screen is a little annoying as they don't have the best accuracy. One of the few airlines that provide care package that includes slippers, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and paste, wich is really nice. If you have little kids they will come around prior to take off with little baggies for them. Plane was clean overall, and the crew were overall very nice although English is not the best, making it hard to understand at times. Food was hit and miss. The main meal was decent, the dessert was great. Our next flight after this was from Istanbul to Lahore and the seating was roomier thats for sure. I think I would have enjoyed the flight more if not for the 4 hour layover that was compounded with a 4 hour delay with another 2 hour delay on the tarmac. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were nice once again. The food was again hit and miss as this time the main meal was not so great, dessert was nice though. Also whats nice is that you can ask for a sandwhich or dessert anytime during the flight or get up and go the the kitchen area and they have water or juice ready for you. Coming back, again the planes were clean and cabin crew were nice. Entertainment system was working all the way through. No delays at the airport this time. Overall I would say this is a decent airline, not the best. They have one big flaw and that is they are known for delays. I was told even before I flew that be prepared for this, I took this remark with a grain of salt as I know that it happens with all airlines. When we got to Istanbul I have never seen so many delays and cancellation on the gate screen, so be prepared for that.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LHE via IST,January 2016,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,E Wong,14th September 2014,"On September 8 I boarded my connection flight scheduled to depart at 6.30pm from Calgary to London Heathrow but after boarding the pilot announces that there was a problem with the de-icing device. They spent hours trying to fix the problem but in the end the flight was canceled. By the time we walked out of the plane it was almost midnight. I understand that due to safety issues there was no choice but to cancel the flight but what I'm extremely upset about was the unhelpful staff and lack of support for the 300 passengers walking out of that plane at midnight in a snowing city hungry and without anywhere to go. After exiting the plane we were summarily dismissed by agents who could do nothing to help us rebook our plane find hotels or even to just to remove our ""checked-in"" status so that we could call the helpline to rebook our flight. Because the desk agents failed to remove my ""checked-in"" status (when I asked they told me it would be done in about an hour which did not happen) I had to call the help line 3 different times before someone there was able to reach the ticket office to fix things up and issue me a new ticket for next evening. Needless to say it was a sleepless night. As a single Canadian adult traveling by myself with all the right gadgets and adequate travel insurance I was lucky enough to sort everything out myself albeit with endless frustrations. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been for foreigner families or elderly people with hearing problems.

Air Canada,1.0,C Kemp,24th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Had a horrible experience with Air Canada (and unfortunately not the first). Upon check-in, the lady at the counter informed me the flight was departing on time as scheduled. Thirty minutes later, the first first delay alerts started to come in. Initially, it was a three hour delay, that became 5hr 15min, eventually it settled at a delay of 4hr and 45 minutes. There was no explanation at all given as to the delay, just told to sit and wait. Time went by, and at around 11pm, the airline's lounge started to broadcast that they were closing. With this flight and several other flights of Air Canada delayed by several hours (one delayed by 6 hours), you would think the airline had the courtesy of keeping the lounge open longer in these exceptional circumstances to accommodate the premium passengers and frequent fliers. Finally, it was time to board, and the boarding area was already full of passengers impatient to board the long-delayed flight. Suddenly, the ground staff came on the intercom and announced that the flight would be ""delayed"" until late afternoon of the next day, a ""delay"" of 21hrs. People were obviously very upset and there was chaos. The ground staff tried their best to calm nerves and frustrations, but the worst was the lack of news, lack of updates and lack of announcements what passengers were entitled to during the flight waiting period. As for the cancellation, they announced that they are not in a position to book hotels for people (not even to offer discount vouchers), so hundreds of people had to go off on their own at 1am! Really unfortunate turn of events (not even sure what happened), but the airline just handled everything very poorly with lack of information and lack of compensation or regard for the wellbeing of passengers.",A330,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Amsterdam,August 2017,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,2.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Dela Santa Corazon,1st September 2014,Our Air Canada flight to Barcelona August 8 and our return from Madrid August 21 were saddled with cancellations delays and very poor customer service. As the 8.50 flight was getting closer to departure time on the night of August 8 passengers were first told that the aircraft had not arrived while the crew had come in. Then we were told that there was no part and it was best to wait and be safe than sorry. By 10.30 additional staff came in and said that the part had arrived. After an hour of waiting close to midnight we learned there was no crew to fly and the flight was cancelled. The station manager came in with security and more staff. The manager said that all hotels in downtown Montreal were full booked thus no hotel for us. He however guaranteed that we would be flying the next day to Barcelona and that we could retrieve our luggage and AC staff will make sure that we are comfortable. There was not a single staff member around after customs so passengers who decided to sleep in the airport went around looking for benches and chairs to sleep on. Vouchers of course were handed over but in the beginning my sister and I were told of the following: no food will be served on the flight but would be available for purchase no re-routing to catch our tour and AC was not responsible if we missed our tour. All these actions on the part of Air Canada were well orchestrated and any questions from passengers was met with Security ready to handle any raising of voices. Our Air Canada saga however did not end in Barcelona. On the way back August 21 from Madrid again the 1.30 pm flight was moved to 3.00 pm. It was not difficult to figure out again the cause for delay. As more fresh looking passengers came in to join the 3 pm flight it was clear the delay was done to combine the 1 pm and 3 pm passengers. The delay caused us to miss the connecting flight in Toronto for Montreal our final destination. When we asked Air Canada customer service if we could take an earlier flight to Montreal we were told that our luggage had been checked in for the 10.30 flight to Montreal. We could not say anything to customer service only to find out that our luggage did not arrive in Montreal in spite of the nearly 3 hour window to load our luggage. As someone enticed to fly Air Canada's direct flight to Barcelona from Montreal this airline gave its passengers a sing song routine when all passengers like me wanted to know what is really happening with our flights. Air Canada should never forget that we paid the fare they asked for be it from a travel agent or online.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Terry Booth,21st July 2015,"On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am. Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again.",Boeing 737-700,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to RIC,July 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Mind you, a 6 hour flight with a screaming 1 year old plus being dragged through a 45 min process just to check bags because computers froze and then employees almost tagged our bags with the wrong tags.

I had cancelled our prior tickets more than a week before flying. When cancelling my flight the rep didn't notify me of this policy. When booking it said there is a cancellation fee but $350 a ticket is crazy. When calling in to re-book, I asked for a manager and was told there was no manager available and that I would need to send in an email. The response time was going to be 7 - 10 days. I called again the next night to speak with a manager, I was told that there was no one available. I said I would wait, they finally put me through, I waited for 10 minutes and was hung up on. I tried calling back again, waited on the phone for an hour and no-one answered. Pretty sure they screened my call. Needless to say we didn't re-book with them and were unable to use our credit.

American Airlines,1.0,R Cawlie,10th July 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to new York JFK. Boarded the plane and pulled away from gate only to find out twenty minutes in that we needed air pressure and a boost and we waited 3 hours with no air in 100 degree weather in Miami just for mechanics to come fix the problem that they said was no big deal. Then we had to wait about an extra hour for a push car to come push the plane and only the crew shows up without the starter car! Had to wait another half hour for them to find the car . And all this we were only told 2.5 hours in that we may leave the plane but the kicker is they were not giving back luggage and were putting whoever wanted to leave on standby to wait whenever they decide to give you another flight. They said it could be tonight tomorrow or next week. How convenient. Who is going to go anywhere without their luggage? Basically didnâ€™t make sense for anyone to leave so we had no choice. On top of all that the flight attendants were the laziest I ever met. I am 6 months pregnant with an 8 month old baby. We were both sweating and overheated. My baby couldnâ€™t even eat it was so hot for her and I asked one for water about an hour in and she pointed to her metal cabinet draws where the water is. Was I supposed to get it myself ? Who knows. I had to start crying to finally get water. Then they said that maybe they should start giving out some water. Maybe? Is that a joke. People are dehydrating. When my husband asked one for iced water she just stared at him with a blank face she only got it once he yelled and then she got mad he yelled ! They only started giving out water about two hours in and had to ration it because they ran out. People had connecting flights in JFK that they missed and you would think they gate manager would help them reschedule or provide them with a compensation but no.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,E Huang,9th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Pittsburgh operated by Delta. A nightmare. After 21-hour flying from Asia to JFK with my little kids, a 7 year and a 2 year old, we supposed to have only 3 hours layover at JFK and a 2 hour flight to get home. The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care. Seat comfort - small, narrow. Cabin staff service - The only thing they can do is to bring you water. Conclusion: very high price for very low cost flight.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Pittsburgh,August 2018,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,A Neil,4th May 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Miami to Atlanta. When boarding the plane the lady checking my bag said she wanted me to check and see if it would fit and if not I would have to check it. I was able to fit it in and she rudely told me I still had to check it even after me telling her I was going to miss my shuttle from Atlanta to Chattanooga. I also told her I was pregnant and really needed to make the shuttle. I had no trouble on the way there and didn't purchase anything this trip so the bag size did not change. Customer service was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so disrespected while traveling. No wonder they have had such horrible reviews lately. They need to work on their employee training so that customers are treated with respect.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Atlanta,2017-05-01 00:00:00,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,9.0,A Whitehouse,12th June 2014,"I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely.

Emirates,8.0,John Hamill,27th October 2015,"Flew Emirates in Business class from Budapest to Shanghai via Dubai. Check in was fast and able to use fast track security. Emirates use the Skycourt lounge in Budapest which is nothing to write home about. Cold food offering, cheap wine and some spirits. Seating was comfortable, but no natural light in the lounge at all. A330 is the Achilles heel of Emirates. I am not sure how they can get away with sending such an uncompetitive aircraft to Budapest. The seats are narrow, recline is limited and are terrible for anything more than a few hours. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and chatty. Overall, not a bed flight apart from the seats. Used the Emirates lounge in concourse B which is excellent. The food and drinks offerings are outstanding and there are a number of great seating options. The lounge is truly enormous and it would be easy to spend a long time in here. I was actually disappointed when I had to leave. The only complaint was the shower room was extremely hot which made getting dressed very uncomfortable. Second flight on an A380 was excellent. The seat is very comfortable and offers great privacy. Being a night flight, service was limited so as to let people sleep. I put the seat in lie flat mode and slept for the best part of 6 hours. Breakfast was served before arrival in Shanghai and it was once again, very good. On arrival in Shanghai, first and business class have a separate baggage carousel and bags arrived promptly.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Modak Sanjay,2nd June 2014,JFK to DWC via DOH. Managed to get first row economy bulkhead seats for self and wife. Found myself sitting next to some sort of bodybuilder guy whose biceps extended over into my space. When they announced all pax on board we swiftly moved over to the centre three seats and took up aisle positions with the centre seat empty. Flight was decent but the IFE was abysmal. Poor choice of movies and entertainment. We were among the first to transit the new airport in Doha - thank goodness no more buses! Marked improvement over the existing airport. At JFK we got 5K miles extra because the Silver lounge was not ready yet but we used our HSBC Premier cards to get into the Oryx lounge. Decent service clean cabins and bathrooms maintained well.

One of the best business class lounges, food, alcohol and facilities are great. Staff are the same as every other lounge. Service In Flight: The first time in my experience of flying business class that I was not greeted with a welcome drink, while other people in the cabin received it. I had a feeling of unwelcomeness from the staff - an overall indifference. The only thing premium is the menu and not necessarily the service. I think the diversity of their crew is the biggest problem. There is no cohesive identity and embedded culture of service and welcoming. Even having to press the call button twice on a few occasions to receive service. Food quality varied - some were delicious, the others not. Seating was very uncomfortable. I was reconsidering my decision to upgrade. I couldn't sleep properly as I am a side sleeper.

Emirates,9.0,Francis Wong,14th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Hong Kong to Cairo via Dubai. Emirates first class is a special travel experience. I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible. While I was off to my shower, my bed was made for me, with night snack of fruits and herbal tea all ready. Emirates ICE entertainment system is the best system. The privacy door is a huge bonus especially for sleeping. The vanity mirror, mini on the side etc. Excellent massage function of the seat. USD 1 for 500 MB of wifi data, every detail has been well thought of. Then there is the excellent menu and such extensive wine list! If you got the budget or mileage to upgrade, here's the way to do it to pamper yourself. I took one star off for the inconveniently closed Bangkok lounge due to renovations.

When we arrived to Shanghai we found out that our luggage was missing and due to time spending in the airport we missed our connection to Macau. The financial damage was very high as we had to re book our flights and buy some basic stuff as our luggage came only 3 days later.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1.0,Oleg Levy,29th December 2013,Flew from Tokyo to Tel Aviv via Moscow around December 4th. Flight from Tokyo was pretty good. From Moscow there are no direct gates so you have to take a bus to board the plane. Waited 10 minutes inside the bus while it was right under the plane already. Another one and a half hour inside the plane before they drive us back to the airport and gave us 400RUB (gets you a coffee). Overall the flight was late by almost 6 hours on a 4 hours route. From Tel Aviv the flight was late by about half an hour. Upon landing had to board the bus again. It drove for about 20 minutes to the terminal. My bags didn't arrive to Tokyo (because the connection was too short).

Qatar Airways,2.0,C Gaunt,11th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I've flown Qatar Airways several times before and always loved the in-flight service and the food. However, never before did anything go wrong. Business class trip to Oman, and on departure from Heathrow they held the plane for an hour and a half for late arriving passengers (so announced the pilot to the passengers). Didn't make any time up in the air, and on landing at Doha it meant half the plane missed our connections, including me, which meant being stranded in Qatar for a night. Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight. The shocking thing is that on return no one cared an ounce about the fact their decision to hold the plane in London - not weather or mechanical. I asked for compensation for the $21 I had to spend on their hotel's Internet and was refused. True customer service shows through when things go badly and Qatar failed in this case. In short, inflight service is definitely one of the best airlines in the world.

We got an A boarding position and had our pick of seats upon entering the aircraft. Both planes were on time and actually got us to our destinations earlier than scheduled. Flight attendance were nice and efficient and pilot was well spoken and friendly when he spoke to the plane about weather, arrival times and such. Seats were very tight, but that was to be expected. Both my husband and I took aisle seats and that makes for easier exiting to bathrooms and such. When we found that the cabin was a little too warm they fixed it right away making the temperature much more agreeable. Snacks were good and coffee was very good! No charge for those on Southwest. Being able to check two bags for no-charge was also nice. I will fly Southwest again and would recommend it to friends and family.

The welcoming by the cabin crew was very appealing and we were served with fresh towels and candies. The in-flight entertainment was also good since they had movies and other audio-visuals in the most updated forms. The food served was very delicious and was specifically served to me as per my special request for food. All the cabin crew were very pleasant and had a smiling face all the time which was very warming for everyone.

Emirates,6.0,A Ritzau,1st October 2014,Caught the Dubai to Adelaide 300-777 Sept 18 2014. After the A380 experience this was definitely a louder bumpier ride! Seats were smaller and more cramped. People had far to much cabin baggage which really annoyed me on this flight as it was us who had stuck to the rules of 7kg limit 1 bag who had to separate our luggage and have it stashed all over the plane. I feel this should be policed by the terminal staff. Our luggage was only ever weighed leaving Adelaide airport. The people in front reclined their seats fully for the whole trip and they were not asked to sit upright when we were trying to eat which had happened on other recent flights. The galley was very noisy especially in down time when the passengers where trying to sleep. The toilets were very noisy when flushed and although we were seated away from the toilet we still constantly got woken by them. Ambience was lovely. Plane was clean and fresh looking although a little worn around the edges. Food was tasty and a lot of it. Drinks were regular but cold drinks were warm. Seemed a common problem on all our flights. Staff were friendly and attentive just loud. My entertainment screen was broken and wouldn't work by touch once I worked out the hand set this was ok.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Benedict Jones,12th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g. A honeymoon), I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip.

I asked hours earlier if they could schedule us on another airline and was told no it must be a KLM flight. We were told we had seats on the Milan flight and when we got there we were on standby. The woman who helped us at United in Milan was kind and got us seats. In the 14 hours we were at Florence airport we were given one voucher for a sandwich. After we got our booking for Milan we had to find and pay our own way and find a hotel. Florence airport only allows one hour of free wifi which we had used early that morning so we had to pay for that too. It was 11:30pm by the time we got to our hotel in Milan and cost about 500 Euros.

American Airlines,2.0,M Blacher,15th January 2014,AA 57 LHR-MIA 31 Dec. Inflight service in First Class seemed friendly enough however the food and beverage suffered by comparison with British Airways. AA serves Dewar's Scotch $20/litre BA Johnnie Walker Blue Label $200/litre. But certainly AA seats while older were lie-flat and comfortable in comparable pods. Where AA fails wretchedly is on the ground in baggage claim and in passing through security in Miami where there is no 'Fast Track' access to ongoing flights. For two years in a row despite flying International First Class with baggage checked and tagged 'Priority' by the international departure airport I waited nearly an hour for the bags in Miami with no American personnel in the baggage claim area to assist and no out source baggage company access to American computers. The result is that a missed or delayed international arriving bag must be reported outside customs and security to AA's baggage service office which does not have access to bags inside customs!,,,First Class,,,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no

I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements.

Not that we ate having had a delicious lunch. We boarded the plane to Mauritius and were immediately impressed by the welcome, the cleanliness and the comfort of the cabin. Straight after take off the Chef (yes they have an on board chef) came round with the dinner menu. Pre dinner drinks were served with small bowls of nuts and olives to be followed by a variety of hot and cold canapÃ©s served from the trolley. Our tray tables were beautifully set and dinner was served with all the little extra chefs touches just like in a first class restaurant. After an truly wonderful meal the cabin crew asked could they make up our beds. A bed pack was produced with mattress pillows and duvet. Our seats then became fully flat beds and I had a restful night. Having already chosen our breakfast we were wakened to yet another lovely meal. Arrival was on time and our baggage arrived quickly We had the same experience on our return flights nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff.

Turkish Airlines customer service extremely chaotic and disorganized, the worst flight experience I have ever had. I realize that the bad weather conditions (snow) was out of the airlines control on the night of 6th January in Istanbul, the service and the little information provided by TK was extremely poor and confusing. Soon after we landed in IST, we were informed that all flights were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. There was no clear information or guidance provided and the few (rude) TK staff members present at Ataturk airport seemed not interested / willing to assist passengers about what to do. All we got was wrong information and their ground staff kept sending us from one desk to another. That first night, after 4 hrs spent in the airport to get some information, I decided to go to an hotel paid by myself. The following morning (07 January) we were informed that all flights were cancelled again due to snow and I had to queue almost 7 hrs at the ticketing office to rebook my flight for the next day. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself again, as there was another extremely long queue at their hotel information desk.

The last flight, IST-BRU, was really dissapointing (especially after a so good flight from HKG to IST). The airplane supposed to be used for that particular flight was normally, as every day, an A330-200 with their Business seat flat-bed, angle-free, 2x2x2 configuration. But unfortunately, in late minute, their plan changed. Probably due to the fact that the plane was not full at all (even the replacement plane, A321). The big dissapointement was when we entered this A321. It was a very old one, in 3x3 configuration, with no real business seat. So even we paid really expensive business class ticket, we got seated in Economy Seat, with the ""chance"" that we were only 2 person in a 3 seat row. But the leg-space was still really tight, and seat really narrow. Bad service, old plane, no screen or inflight entertainment, really bad seating for that price.

Upgraded on the return flight which was Frankfurt to Dulles on Lufthansa 418 on December 13 2014. Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal especially if the person in the seat in front leans back. The seats are narrow and not comfortable. They are squeezed together so much that the seat pocket in front of you can barely hold one bottle of water. Food has greatly degraded over the past few years. I feel degraded by being in economy class. It is insulting to pay for such a horribly uncomfortable trip. I felt like baggage being crammed into the baggage hold and that I had no value as a customer. Our return flight was much better as we unhappily upgraded to economy plus but we greatly resented being forced to pay more money just to have a seat that was adequate for an overseas flight.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Qatar Airways,4.0,Ali Soufan,27th April 2015,LHR-DXB via DOH. Both legs of the flights were operated by an aged A340-600. I think Qatar should start thinking of not sending these aircraft's to such long haul routes. Aircraft was very tired from inside and the leg room was awful - so tight. Your flight would be ruined if the person in front reclines their seat as there will no room for you to move or watch. Food was of a very low standard. Coming back again aircraft was an A330-200/300 leg. Frankly speaking the leg room was much better on this aircraft however again old and tired from inside with cabin crew not being attentive to passengers.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,no
Southwest Airlines,2.0,Chad Heinrich,23rd November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Phoenix. Very disappointed in Southwest Airlines. I fly at round trip at least once a month with Southwest and I am usually very happy with the airline overall. However, I recently had a trip scheduled to go from Phoenix to LA, LA to Denver and Denver back to Phoenix. My client in Denver had to reschedule our meeting and my admin bought a new one way ticket for me to get back to LA from Phoenix and she also bought a new round trip to go to Denver the following week. Unfortunately, she forgot to cancel one of my initial flights (Denver back to Phoenix) and it was not until I received an email notification from Southwest that I realized the flight had never been cancelled. I immediately called Southwest (was on hold for 27 minutes) and explained the situation. I was hopeful that due to my loyalty and this one time oversight, Southwest would at least issue me a credit toward another future flight. That was not the case. It was explained to me that there was nothing they could do. I think it is time for me to find a new airline.

Jetblue Airways,10.0,F Boulos,28th August 2014,August 20 2014 flight 124. We flew from LAX to JFK on Mint. I can honestly say that I was very impressed! I have flown business class on many international airlines and the on-board service was comparable in every way. The food was excellent - best I have had on any airline. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and very attentive and our bags were the first to arrive at the carousel as promised. Furthermore the seats reclined to a flat position. All in all a great trip. The one suggestion for JetBlue is to have a small lounge area to accommodate Mint customers at larger airports such as LAX.,,,,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes

Boarding rather chaotic waited in aisle for passengers to get into seats airline should have started boarding rear seats first.

Seating in the Boeing 757-200 was spacious and comfortable. (We sat in their Economy Plus which offered plenty of leg room and I'm six feet tall.) Entertainment was plentiful and varied (I watched three recent movies I had missed in theatres) and the viewing screen was quite large enough.

American Airlines,8.0,R Chalmers,20th March 2015,New York (JFK) to Antigua during the very bad snow on the US East Coast. Early morning departure was going well until we reached the gate and found that a problem with a burst pipe meant no baggage could be loaded. However assume this was a knock on from the weather conditions. We were kept relatively well informed about delay which extended to around 3 hrs. However the anticipation of arriving in 85 degrees warmth mitigated the delay. Service on aircraft was fine. We had seats with extra leg room. Inflight entertainment ok. Only soft drinks were free. We had an egg sandwich which was OK. Flight back was also delayed slightly but made up time to arrive near to scheduled time. No queue at immigration. However all this came to nought due to baggage problem at aircraft which meant we waited an hour for bags to arrive.

American Airlines,1.0,L Gramado,8th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | From all the bad reviews I've read here, it seems like AA doesn't really care about it's customers, but I'll write this review anyway. I have just flown from Montreal to Charlotte, and I was mistreated by a flight attendant for no reason. The airplane had already landed and we were waiting our turn to stop at the gate, which was taking a while, I needed to go to the restroom really bad, and since I didn't know how much longer it would take, I decided to get and go. I told the flight attendant in the rear of the airplane that I needed to go really bad, the other flight attendant in the front, who never bothered to ask if I had any health issues that would force me to go even if it wasn't the appropriate time, simply said in the mic for the entire flight to hear, ""we are all going to have to wait here until this person in the restroom returns to his seat.""

Turkish Airlines,9.0,B Dowe,23rd January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bogota to Rome via Istanbul. We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places. Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at AtatÃ¼rk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at AtatÃ¼rk airport. Things probably would have been different for us if we had travelled some days earlier.

She refused to allow me to return for it or ask a member of staff at the plane to bring it down or to try and obtain it herself. The impression I got was that my issue was an inconvenience for her and she did not care at all about helping customers. Then I returned a second time to Moscow airport 10 days later.

They didn't provide good customer service on or off the ground. We arrived well over 3 hours for a domestic flight and no one kept us informed if we would make the flight or not due to the computer problems they were having and could not print tickets. This is understandable but to pick people who were yelling and causing the most commotion as opposed to calming veryone down letting all passengers know that the flight crew is aware of the problem and no one would be missing their flight. When i would try and ask questions i was dismissed without answers and they were rude. Leaving the trip had a horrible experience with them as well. Again we allowed ourselves plenty of time especially after our first encounter with them. We again waited in line for hours when we finally approached the desk They only let 2 of us check our bags. The other 2 family members they refused to allow them on and had them fly out later that night. I have never encountered such an uncompassionate and unorginized company.

Able to use the Qantas lounge in ADL due to QF status nothing out of the ordinary but you need to allow time to pass through immigration etc at the gate. Boarding started well ahead of time (on all legs) and was strictly by seating zone which worked well and lead to on time departures all 4 legs. I prefer an aisle seat and on 3 of the 4 legs the middle seat was unoccupied. Chose the small Y class section just behind business which was good. I found the seat and leg room good but then I am quite short. Note that aisle seats don't always have power plugs but the USBs worked well. ICE was impressive but the relentless ads got a bit annoying after a while even though you can fast forward them. Service was universally good and friendly albeit with the inevitable slightly ""plastic"" airline feel to it. Hot towels menus small amenity kit. Food was more than adequate on all legs and always got my preference. Trays cleared away promptly regular drinks runs and staff seemed to respond to individual calls. Liked the mood lighting overnight and slept well. Transit in DXB worked well no long lines at security even a peak hours. One bus transfer but very efficient. Used the lounge in DXB - yes its big but just move away from the central hub and there are lots of quiet spots to chill out.

US Airways helped me with seats for my family on their 3 legs. I tried to log in to my flight the night before to book seats to together and found to my horror there were no seats together and I had no choice but to choose from the few left. Arrived at Miami and flight was showing on time. Shortly before take off it became a 30 minute delay. Many people waiting concerned as they had connections like us. Some had no boarding passes for their US airways flight as they could not print these on check in. Unhelpful lady at desk would not help meaning those without passes then had to go chasing around PHL airport to get passes printed. Flight landed 30 minutes late cue rush as the plane was packed and most had connections to make. We were lucky as our flight departed from Terminal A. Still it left no time to go to any shops or buy food and drink. For their abysmal customer service for refusing to help me but worse by far for the first time in my life having my entire family split up on a plane and having to sit with total strangers I will boycott AA.

On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests.

Qatar Airways,5.0,F Hendricks,26th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset. The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad. For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience.

My husband and I travel very often. Heâ€™s Executive Platinum with American and travels well over 100k miles a year. Iâ€™ve been considering switching airlines due to the terrible customer service weâ€™ve been receiving. We spend too much money to not be treated well. The last 3 trips weâ€™ve taken have been hell. We had to call customer service multiple times to check in and get out tickets corrected. Every agent told us they were going to fix the problem but of course never did so we ended up almost missing flights because of it. Our return flight 3/29/18 was a disaster. We had a 30 minute delay leaving Philly so ended up missing our connection at 2:30. They put up on the standby list for one flight and also booked us for another flight. We ended up having to get on the second flight which was due to leave at 6:50pm from Dallas but ended up being delayed until 9:00pm. It was such a disaster. We lost our upgrade due to the delayed flight and having to switch flights. We had to travel 3.5 hours uncomfortably. We were suppose to make it back to LAX by 4:54 and didnâ€™t return until 10:30pm.

United Airlines,1.0,Serena Kratz,24th July 2015,"Since there is only one flight a day to Aguadilla PR from Newark we have taken this flight a number of times, it is always late. In January, the delay was due to ""insufficient crew"" this time, the almost 1.5 hour delay was due to ""awaiting aircraft"". This flight had incredibly cramped seats that are hard and have almost no recline. The pocket in fron of the seat was very low on the seat in front so that when I put my book in the pocket it bulged out so much that I had to keep my knees apart. The entertainment is only for a $7.99 fee per person, and there was only one offer of a four ounce cup of a liquid for the entire 3.5 hour flight. United planes are new so this uncomfortable seat situation is going to continue, I would avoid United if at all possible.

United Airlines,4.0,J Egleton,1st October 2015,"London to Charleston via Newark, and Myrtle Beach to Toronto via Newark. The most positive things I can say about my United Airlines experience were that I made my connections and my bags arrived in the right place on time. There it stops. Why are United using antique 767s on the London - Newark route? They are uncomfortable, the noisiest aircraft I have ever travelled on, the food was basically inedible. As for IFE, I think I would have been less offended if there was none. Minute screen, and only a choice of 5 or so films, which played on a loop so if you missed the start or - heaven forbid - wanted to go to the bathroom, then tough luck, you've missed part of the film. Cabin staff were friendly. On arrival at Newark, I was pleasantly surprised to make my connection between terminals in under two hours. However, like their planes, the circle of hell that is the United gates at Terminal A desperately needs dragging into the 21st century. EWR-CHS leg was on a tiny ERJ145 which was thrown around in a thunderstorm. The stewardess was the finest I have ever encountered though",,,,,,,,,,,,

That caused a strong misdundertanding among passengers and the ground crew for about half an hour. 2) The flight was rescheduled to 8am. It was a late flight (11.15 pm) and they were very slow to solve the situation. Therefore, a group of people could not go to the hotel and got stuck in the airport. The group of about 20 people had to stay outside the security area from 2am until 4am with CAN30 for dinner and brekfast meals. 3) No alternative to these passengers was presented. 4) Air Canada shamily sent an email with a promocode to be used in the next 60 days, otherwise it will expire. This promo could not be used for upgrade on a next flight.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Natalie Tan,10th January 2016,"London to Singapore via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, and a 22 hour delay on the ground. Outbound to London, everything went excellent - service by attendants and minimal delays taking off and landing. When I fell asleep on the first leg from Singapore to Istanbul and couldn't find my glasses, the attendant was very helpful in searching for it, even ripping out the seat in case it was stuck there. Food was really good also, considering when I slept through meal service and by the time I woke up, the flight attendant told me that my meal wasn't fresh anymore so she gave me a business class vegetarian meal instead. However, on my inbound flight on New Year's Eve/day, everything was a mess! I showed up at Heathrow to hear of a flight delay. Supposedly 1 hour became four, then five hours due to snow. They could have updated the website or sent a courtesy email so I didn't have to spend 8 hours at the airport before take off. Landed in Istanbul after circling for 2 hours due to lack of landing spots and another 2 hours waiting on the runway. Missed my connecting flight of course, and had to queue for 2 hours to get rebooked and re-sorted out on my next flight back to Singapore. Total chaos there with 30 crying babies at any one time and very rude, sneaky men cutting in line and making offensive remarks when I didn't let them cut in behind/infront of me. Ground staff and customer service desperately need training on conflict resolution and soft skills. Finally got on my plane, yet after another 1:30 delay.

Talk about the benefit of a merger. More than a weather delay, it was a blatant organizational failure. After 5 hours of delay, we were offered the famous airport sandwich, but that's insulting for other sandwiches to call it that. In Aug 16 we took 4 flights with American, for a total of 11 hours delay. It costed us money and precious time.

Qatar Airways,6.0,S Rajesh,28th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Barcelona to Mumbai via Doha in Economy class, paid to upgrade to business on DOH-BOM segment during online check in. On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. There's a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard. The Doha lounge was overrated and almost appalling for me.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,E Smith,11th January 2016,"We arrived at the Charlotte, NC airport around 7:45 am, giving us more than enough time to prepare and check in for our flight out at 9:45 am. To begin our day of misfortune, our flight was delayed due to weather purposes, which is understandable, till around 10:15 am. As we were flying out from Charlotte to our connecting flight in Detroit, we realized that we only had, what we thought, was a 38 minute layover to make it to our next flight out of Detroit. However, as we were leaving the terminal, we learned that the connecting flight was not delayed at all and we had approximately 3 minutes to make it to the gate before the flight began its departure. As I ran ahead and sprinted to the gate to try and save my family and I some grief, I was greeted by a Delta representative who proceeded to inform me that I was to late to get on the flight, even though I could physically see our plane sitting in the loading spot, motionless. So, my family, along with around 15 other people who experienced the same I convienemt timing and planning due to Delta, watched the flight we had payed for depart in front of us. To try to salvage this situation, the crowd of left behind passengers began to congregate to the airlines help kiosk, where we virtually on went to be told that we needed to call and contact a Delta representative about changing flights - even though there was a representative standing right in front of us. To make things even better, once we had finally jumped through enough hoops and made it onto our flight from Detroit to Las Vegas (6 hours later), we were surprised to find out that not only did any of our luggage make it to Las Vegas, but they were sent on a flight that departed 3 hours after we were scheduled to land. So, after speaking with a Delta baggage representative who realistically was no help, my family and probably 5-10 other passengers sat in the Las Vegas terminal for upwards to 3-3 1/2 hours before finally receiving our baggage. Not to mention that all of this was at the expense of us passengers, with the Delta representative claiming that ""there was nothing that they could do"".

Apart from some minor ""beauty defects"", none of which turned out to be Lufthansa Â´s fault, the flight was uneventful and quite pleasant. We spent some time at the ""Sala Pau Casalls"" business lounge which is a total let-down (see my separate review). Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes. They refused to let me take my trolley bag onboard because, despite the fact that it has the required dimensions, it expands when it is fully packed. They didnÂ´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. There is no inflight entertainment except via the downloadable LH app, which some people will object to, but I donÂ´t.

American Airlines,1.0,J Burnam,16th September 2015,"I am totally fed up with American Airlines. AA1021 departed Las Vegas without incident and on time. The flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth is only about 2 hours. The A320 can easily fly for over 4 hours. While over Wichita Falls, the pilot announces that he is low on fuel and has to divert to Wichita Falls. Later, the pilot comes over the intercom and tries to explain that it is because of weather around Dallas. Savvy passengers on the flight check this and find there are no current delays at DFW. Why does he not have enough reserve fuel? Maybe the FAA should look into this. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight to Richmond from Dallas. American Airlines had only 2 customer service reps to process about 125 angry passengers. It was after midnight when we got our new airlines tickets for our continuing flight. Our flight was 9:30AM the next day. American Airlines offered us a hotel, but at our own expense. No food vouchers were ever offered. American Airlines left us stranded waiting for our next flight.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Sarah Markland,17th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | It was the worst flight I've ever taken. Flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Islip, NY. They delayed us an hour due to weather, 2 hours due to air traffic control, and then 5 hours because the pilot's hours to fly had expired and they needed to find another crew. Found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. They then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. I was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. They refused a hotel, transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. They expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. Meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. I get on the flight for 24 hours later, a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm. I had to reschedule my flight for the following day yet again and they weren't willing to provide hotel, transportation or food once again. So my flight was initially 6.30pm from Fort Lauderdale and we were supposed to land at 9.20pm in Islip. We were given an hour delay due to weather (7.30pm-10.30pm). After the delay, we boarded the plane (7.00pm). They then proceeded to keep us on the plane for over an hour as directed by federal air traffic control (8.00pm). Then they made us sit another hour on the plane demanding that we all stay in our seats and stay buckled because they expected to depart soon (9pm). After this hour, the pilot comes on the PA system and told us that he's reached the maximum number of consecutive hours that the pilot policies allow (9.30). They took us back to the gate where we were given no updates or information for at least 2 hours (11.30). After this, they told us that they were trying to find a pilot and crew to fly the plane. They then told us that our flight would board at 12.50am. They delayed us twice more until they cancelled my flight at approximately 2am. They automatically rebooked me for a flight that would board at 8.30am in Fort Lauderdale and would bring me to Tampa. They would then give me a 10 hour layover in Tampa. I would board the 10.30pm flight to Islip and get back at approximately 1.30am. I waited in a line 3 hours to get this changed and also demanded a hotel, transportation, and food (5am). They hadn't fed us anything but a mini sized bag of mini pretzels and 6oz of water in 13 hours. They refused a hotel. They refused transportation. They refused food. They also told me that they could not change this horrible flight. I went back to them twice and harassed them before they finally put me on a flight that boarded exactly 24 hours from the one I originally had. The woman was extremely snotty and rude to me the entire time. I had to call my friend at 5 in the morning after she, her parents and my parents stayed up the entire night. My friend picked me up at 5.45am because Southwest wouldn't even provide me with a taxi.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Fort Lauderdale, FL to Islip, NY",June 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

No flight attendant helped me out in any way like putting luggage up in the cabin, picking up her toys for me, or even just being friendly. Everyone treated me like I was a hassle to deal with. One attendant refused to give me my bassinet because service had started, even though I had already been waiting for an hour. It only takes a few seconds to latch it on. One flight attendant actually made eye contact with my smiley daughter and waved, which was nice. One Japanese male attendant who I spoke to in Japanese, replied to me in English even though (he was speaking Japanese to the other staff so) I know he spoke Japanese. Why not speak back to me in Japanese? That is just plain rude. Other than that, after experiencing JAL last year, I thought the food was extremely disappointing. I also specifically made a phone call just to request a bassinet, but when I went to check in, there was no such request. I was baffled.

American Airlines,1.0,David Wobcke,4th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines managed to somehow cancel our tickets that were purchased months previously. The flight was critical for us as we were flying from New York to Los Angeles to connect for our international flight back to Australia later the same day. The first inkling of a potential problem was the day before when I was unable to check in online, so spent hours at an AA office in Manhattan trying to resolve the issue. I was given various explanations but ultimately they accepted no responsibility, asserting that our travel agent in Australia had cancelled or voided the tickets. Again, at the check in counter on the day of the flight, the issue remained unresolved with a supervisor basically saying that our travel agent had ripped us off. We had no alternative but to purchase new tickets (fortunately, I had made a tentative booking the day before in case it was needed, otherwise we would have likely missed our LAX connection considering all flights were full). After returning home, AA repeated their conclusion after investigating the matter that our travel agent had cancelled our tickets which of course they denied so demanded further investigation. Weeks later, American Airlines admitted that the error was theirs all along and offered to reimburse the cost of the new tickets. There was also a gesture of compensation for our inconvenience - a $50 voucher towards another flight on American Airlines - of zero value to us in Australia. Overall, a very disappointing experience given the stress and inconvenience that resulted from their mistake. I would suggest that their staff receive improved training on dealing with such hopefully rare cases - being left in the lurch at a critical time by indifferent staff doesn't leave you with a great impression of an airline.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,October 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Brandi Porter,29th July 2015,"Everytime I fly with this airline there is a 3 or more hour delay due to ""awaiting aircraft."" One time is was because the pilot was in a different city and had to get to Boston to fly out, which took 5 hours! Another time the plane was awaiting the crew which was coming from a different city apparently. Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous. First off I had a connection flight and was not notified of the delay. Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time. So in my experience this airline is all about delays if your current flight is coming from another city. I get it, things happen but this airline really needs to improve its punctuality.

Well, due to poor weather we circled Phoenix airport until we ran low on fuel.

Long and short of it, there was a line of planes ahead of us. They would not allow anyone off and we sat there for about 2 hours before getting refueled while being told we were headed back to Phoenix shortly. No food, people missed connecting flights, I was forced to say overnight in Phoenix and missed a very important day of work in Omaha. American insisted they would not offer any compensation in terms of food, hotel, etc., since it was weather related. On top of I found out from another flyer the hotel rooms offered at a ""discount"" at the Red Lion Inn were actually more expensive than their regular prices. Waiting in American Airlines customer service line was horrible, took a long time (over an hour) with lots of angry people.

United Airlines,1.0,D Edwards,18th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Absolute worst airline I've ever flown with. I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate. Absolute swindle. You buy a cheap flight because you can afford it, but then you have to pay extra for something every other basic airline ticket allows you to have.

Very reduced service as on US domestic flights and only drinks free of charge. Flight was on time and in order. From IAD to ZRH on Boeing 767-300, comfort was again not very good, only a little legroom and the man behind me was slightly larger, so pushed the whole flight with his knees into my seat, which was very annoying.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Brian McNay,29th January 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Last week I flew from San Jose to Phoenix on a Southwest flight at 3:45 in the afternoon. When we got off the plane in Las Vegas I left my coat on the plane. We immediately tried to call to find out what we needed to do and figured we should probably go to the baggage claim area where the Southwest office was. We went there and of course there was no coat. We filled all the information out and have heard nothing. It's a shame that someone from Southwest would take my coat. It didn't make it a few hundred yards from the plane to the baggage claim office where the lost-and-found was.

Not much information given apart from aircraft was circling above probably due to fog but other flights although smaller jets landed up to 2 hours earlier. On board aircraft had no personal screens and on take off the Captain announced there would be no IFE with no reason given. Transit at IST should have been 6 hours but due to the delay we had a 1 hour transfer so a rush to the departure gate. Flight to LHR arrived a half hour early but checked in baggage was left in IST.

Few people could or cared to speak English and airline staff were rude, dismissive and aggressive. They were in a queue for 4 hours to be told they need to return the following day. My nephew had a broken foot and was in a cast. They were also told to sleep in the airport as there was no available accommodation. They arrived home 48 hours after leaving CT. Their 3 suitcases have subsequently been lost. After 10 days they've received no feedback, no returned calls and their calls ring unanswered. When my sister did get through she was told there was no update. We understand that life happens.

United Airlines,7.0,R Paterson,18th February 2015,AUS-IAH-LGA in F. First segment on a new E175 in Economy Plus. Actually really surprised at the comfort of the seat despite all the negative press about the new Slimline product. Of course this flight was only about 30 minutes but for a regional hop not bad at all. Continuing segment was on A319 in F. Seat was moderately comfortable but pitch was lacking and by the end of this 3 hour flight I was definitely eager to deplane. Service was attentive and professional however and drinks were consistently refilled. Food could have been better but what else is new.

American Airlines,8.0,S Robinson,31st October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow in C on a B777-300. Arrived from a domestic flight and transfer in DFW hassle-free, but involved an (easy) change of terminals. DFW is probably one the very best transfer airports in the U.S. AAdmirals Club in DFW was nicer than others I have been to, but offerings very minimal and sub-par for an international flight. Food and ""premium"" drinks for purchase at steep airport prices. Coffee/tea, soft drinks for free. Basic beer and wine available from a manned bar (this is the U.S., so ""free"" means ""for tips""). WIFI was reliable. Overall, definitely not comparable to the lounge experience offered by non U.S.-based airlines. Boarding fairly orderly and cabin crew good and friendly. Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FAâ€™s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated. Catering out of AAâ€™s hub in DFW seems to be superior to that out of other locations. Cabin crew professional, obviously experienced and good, even friendly. On-time departure and on time arrival (more or less). Good experience and nothing to complain about. Comparing to other carriers I have used in C over the Atlantic: as for Oneworld alternatives AA is way ahead of BA (especially due to seating arrangement on AAâ€™s B777-300 vs. BAâ€™s high density 2-4-2 seating), probably in line with AY, but not quite on the level of IB. Also, I would rate the overall experience on Star Allianceâ€™s OS and LX higher, but again AA did good on this flight. Recommended, if you are on B777-300 (seating can be much inferior on other planes types).",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow,November 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes

When arriving in Rome, we again contacted a service staff. She was much more friendly and informed us that Alitalia had some software problems resulting in bookings via the internet not being correctly processed internally. She promised that our costs will be reimbursed. We then contacted Alitalia to get our reimbursement. Unfortunately, although we spent much time to precisely indicate all circumstances and additional costs, Alitalia only reimbursed the 254â‚¬ for the original ticket but did not reimburse the additional costs of 380â‚¬ for the extra flight to Rome (and we had to pay another 250â‚¬ for the flight back from Rome).

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,9.0,M Marnay,27th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Venice to Los Angeles via Moscow. I booked this last minute due to Air Berlin going bankrupt and cancelling our flights. Had some hesitation, but overall I had a good experience. Premium economy rate was reasonable, however seat choice was problematic. The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat. The waiting room in Moscow airport are small, I would find an empty waiting area and head to our terminal once we are closer to boarding. Or in our case we stayed at the V capsule hotel in the airport.

Lufthansa,4.0,K Fortwaengler,9th March 2015,As large person (6ft 4in) it is almost impossible to sit in one of the standard economy class seats! I learnt that with the cheaper tickets a seat reservation is no longer possible. So even if you check in online (24 hours prior to the flight) only middle seats are available - absolutely impossible for people like me! I had luck that one person didn't check in so one of the seats with additional leg space was available. The crew supported me in this (the woman at the check-in told me that the seat maybe would be available and I should ask at the gate as I've arrived at the gate they already were informed). So this time leg space was no issue but if you don't like close contact to your neighbors you will not stay in the seat for a long time! You can't sit erect you have to buckle. I've spend more than 50% of the time walking around and chatting with the very friendly crew. For me (not paying an extra charge) this seat was OK. But for my neighbor who paid extra it was annoying - he like me was more walking around than sitting in the insufficient seat!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,no

Aegean Airlines,2.0,David Worcester,27th November 2015,"A bit of a wait at the Business class check in but at least Business/Aegean Miles and Bonus Gold get to use the fast track passport control and security and the dingy Aegean Business class lounge. The lounge offered a reasonable selection of food and drink but not really high-end and the fact that 2 flights were leaving in short succession meant the lounge was fairly crowded at one point. Despite there being several vacant air bridge gates we had to suffer being bussed to a remote stand which involved no priority boarding and being herded onto a bus that was almost bulging at the seams by the time we left. There was a sort of welcome onboard by the cabin crew member as she was on the phone. Pre take off drinks were offered but without any real enthusiasm or engagement. After take off there was the usual hot towel, menu and drinks but no real customer engagement. The cabin crew member pushed the meal trolley into the cabin and set down the table mats and offered bread, placing it on the mat and moved on. A colleague had to tell her that she had forgotten to hand out meal trays. No apology, no making a joke of it, just a robotic performance of giving us our meal trays. That summed up the service. If you wanted anything you had to press the call button because even though various cabin crew floated through the cabin casually glancing at empty glasses at no time did they ask if anyone would like a refill. The liqueur trolley was pushed into the business class cabin but again it was something they had to do because it was in the service plan. London couldn't come quick enough. There was nothing really to thank them for. Cabin crew make the trip. At least the e-passport gates were quiet and after a 5 minute wait my bag was third on the carousel.

Lufthansa,10.0,H Severin,3rd October 2015,"I flew Frankfurt to Buenos Aires in Lufthansa First Class at the end of August 2015. Before the flight, I visited the First Class Terminal. Having been there a few years before, it's amazing how Lufthansa keeps the service at such a high level. When the plane was ready to board, I was driven to the 747-8 with a Porsche Cayenne. First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive. IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was. On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger. On arrival in Buenos Aires we were greeted by a representative who explained us how the immigration process works and told us that our luggage would be delivered to a dedicated luggage belt.

Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website.

The service was not good, for example the hostess came only once to offer some water (during dinner time) and nothing more afterwards. When you asked for something (e.g. additional drink), it was like asking for a huge favor, and I was in Premium Economy! The plane was not clean, I had a broken biscuit under my seat.

Long line of people queing to board not by row numbers, little delayed in leaving. Sat down the back by the tail, seat 93e. Short of crew on this flight for some reason, could clearly see the results as the service was slow and the crew function like robots, no smile, just doing the motions. Food standard fare nothing special, in-flight entertainment was bad, not much to choose from, not a good selection and the touchscreen was slow to respond.

We were given Taxi fare to get home but the queue was very unorganised - some were getting hotels others cabs but were not directed.

We had previously flown from JFK to Istanbul a week earlier so we knew what to expect as far as seat comfort movie selection and meals. This time however the flight crew was very different from the last crew. It was obvious from the moment we walked on the plane that the crew was unfriendly and unprofessional. They seemed completely unconcerned for the well being of the passengers. We received a tiny cup of coffee at take off and did not get any more in the 11 hour flight! The beverage cart only came around when meals were served - twice! The bathroom went from clean to disgusting in about three hours and remained that way.

Delta Air Lines,7.0,Brian Smith,18th February 2015,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall.

American Airlines,6.0,Davide Greco,29th December 2015,"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.","Boeing 737-800, Boeing 767-300",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to MXP via MIA,December 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no

We paid extra money for more legroom and, whilst understanding the reality of cramped spaces on any airline, expected what we paid for. We have done this on several occasions with Virgin and found the seating and surrounding area to be more than satisfactory. Instead the area in front was constantly used by passengers to access toilets on the other side of the plane and for a toddler (parents seated three rows behind) to run backwards and forwards. The space to the right of us over the wing was used by passengers to stretch and chat the entire overnight flight. The stewards/ stewardesses were nowhere in sight and surfaced only at meal time. The passenger seated beside my husband was a very large man who required an extension belt, no problem and not judging him, but it made for a very uncomfortable flight. Being a large man, he occupied some of my husband's seat as well as his own. When it was obvious (before take-off) the flight was going to be difficult due to this factor, the stewardess responded that she could understand it would be uncomfortable but the flight was full and there was nothing she could do. We contacted Air Canada upon our return to request a refund of the additional money outlaid and were told that they offer a high standard of service and apologised that we disagreed - basically 'bad-luck'!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to SYD,November 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Nick Kambounias,28th October 2014,My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each.

There were only two small things I did not get - table - very difficult to pull out and angle - to a point flight attendants had issues with it. And second was iPad for entertainment? Really.

And when I asked why they collected it so early they said they were preparing for landing. 4 hours ahead? The same on 777-300ER they keep collecting the headphones at least 1 hour before landing therefore you can't use the system.

My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,9.0,M Tushishvili,28th October 2014,I had excellent flights PAR-DYU-PAR by Turkish airlines. The economy seat comfort was satisfactory for the space the entertainment and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of high quality and good quantity. I really appreciate that sandwiches were served after dinner as the second service for IST-DYU flight (about 5 hours flight).

The flight attendant came and collected the blankets 45 minutes before the landing and she did that in a firm way, like there was no discussion. I gave her mine (even though I am very cold whenever an AC is on) and had to ask her to let my daughter keep it. She said yes in a way like she was doing a favour to me. Then the lady next seat told her that she needed to keep the blanket, because she was sick and the flight attendant had a back and forth with her until she conceded at the end. Then after that, she came for the headphones 35 minutes before the landing with an almost rude attitude. My daughter and I were nearly finishing our movie and wanted to tell her that, but then I was watching around and no one was saying anything - I felt like I would be the only one complaining. I gave her both headphones and sat there for 30 minutes thinking about this flight. After all, leaving a blanket and a headphone for the passenger until the end of the flight is not asking too much.

Basically, after looking forward to flying on the Dreamliner, the way united have configured the plane and the service ruined my experience. Although leg room was fine, the seat width is dire.

Air New Zealand,5.0,Judge Anthony,21st March 2014,I have travelled on a number of occasions from Melbourne to Christchurch and have much admired the unique qualities of that experience as an introduction to NZ. On the last occasion this was on a code sharing flight with Virgin. The experience reversed my previous appreciation of the introduction to NZ. The best of NZ Airlines seems to have been undermined by the worst of Virgin. I watched an Air NZ ground staff member stand by and instruct my wife to load her weighty suitcase on to the luggage belt before I could intervene. My wife had spent the previous two days undergoing heart check ups. Furthermore I was impressed to note the speed with which the ground staff requested an extra 80 dollars for an extra bag when it was reasonably evident that the extra bag could have been packed into the non-extra one. Please note that the comment rating relates to the experience in the code sharing flight with Virgin.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,J Howard,1st July 2014,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,no

Emirates,10.0,Chia Ty,23rd June 2014,13/6/14 EK71 DXB-CDG. Boarding very orderly by zones. Sparkling new aircraft of 0.6 years old. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Snack service 1h after take off and drinks another 30m later. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach and scrambled eggs with hash browns. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff creamed spinach really good. Fruits were fresh too. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread made me feel like I'm in France already. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was really good on this flight the best flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they even asked me to sit down and they'll return the bottle to me. I asked for 3 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and they obliged as well with a smile. Excellent service beats SQ on this leg.

As Air New Zealand does not have business class trans tasman from some cities I had to take my flight via Auckland. We took off on time but, unfortunately there was a medical emergency on board and the flight had to land back in Christchurch. I understand and support the fact that the aircraft turned around to ensure the health of the passenger. There were numerous passengers connecting on different flights. I asked the crew member and she told me that the airline had made arrangements on arrival in Auckland for connecting flights and that we would need to hurry to catch the connecting flight. Arrived in Auckland and were met by an Air New Zealand staff member and were put on a bus to international terminal. At no time was I told that they would not hold the connecting flight NZ105. Had to run through the terminal and immigration to try and catch the flight, there was an Air New Zealand representative outside immigration who told me the gate had closed a few minutes ago and that I needed to go to the international transfer desk. I attended the transfer desk only to be advised that I would be put on an alternative flight, I was happy with that but it was not a business class flight. I have paid for a business class flight so I expect to be put on a business class flight. Staff at the transfer counter could not give a dam about it, just rolled their eyes and said oh well. I asked for a refund and the lady handed me the telephone of which there was a long wait to talk to an Air New Zealand staff member for my refund. I hung up and then asked to speak to the manager who told me that I could get a refund at the ticketing office in the departures hall or by submitting a email. I then had to proceed back the other way though immigration and customs to the check in terminal and book a business class flight on QF so I could get back to Sydney. I managed to get a flight immediately and I paid full fare for the flight. Under advice from the manager at the transfer desk I then proceeded to the ticket office to get a refund. I was then told that this could not be done and I had to ring up. Emailed the Air New Zealand executive teams personal emails with a complaint over a week ago and still have not heard anything back.

My wife had to speak to gate agent on speaker phone to even get her to do basic customer service. The lack of compassion this gate agent showed is appalling. Regardless of any additional fees paid or not the safety of a minor should have been Delta Airlines main priority. Leaving a minor stranded without rectifying the issue is unacceptable. It should not have taken a call from an adult to fix. She knows her job she chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum or actually even less than that. With all the bad press Delta has been receiving you would think that retraining your agents would be a priority.

Qatar Airways,8.0,B Mandeno,6th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew New York to Doha return on an A350 in Business Class in late October. The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard.

United Airlines,1.0,B Saunders,7th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Our group was returning to the US after two weeks of international travel. At the United terminal we endured an overbooked check-in with rude ground agents.

The inflight service was just as rude as what we experienced in the terminal. Air New Zealand (the service we used in Australia and New Zealand) by comparison was staffed with a pleasant, polite and accommodating in flight crew.

Air Canada,3.0,T Mark,28th March 2015,Just flew AC6 and AC5 and I have to say that AC are the worst airline I have been on. The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery. As a regular NH flyer I feel the code-share between AC and NH reflects badly on NH who are outstanding. First and last time to fly AC - an airline who are really let down by the worst flight attendants I have seen.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,9.0,James Boxer,18th January 2016,"I've frequently flown First and Business Class on American Airlines so I was keen to experience Delta's Premium product, flying from Salt Lake City to Paris CDG. Beginning with the boarding process, we boarded slightly late. Then with no notice they started boarding us. I was welcomed on board and made my way to the seat. The seat and private space was smaller than I am used to from flying with AA, but it is also a smaller aircraft. The seat offered a full recline, duvet and pillow. I found the seat fairly comfortable and although there was a massage function, it wasn't very effective. I also found there to be very little space to store anything small in the seat. Additional there was no call button for the crew. I was provided an amenity kit which was a very nice Tumi case. After settling in I was offered a drink. The TV display was smaller than I expected with an adequate range of entertainment. The aircraft was WIFI equipped. After take-off I was offered a hot-towel and had my drink order taken, then served a very nice dinner which I could chose from a menu. I found the cabin crew of a very high standard, they went above and beyond and made sure every request was taken care of quickly. This was probably one of the most professional premium class crew I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Unfortunately for breakfast they had run out of the choice I wanted even though the cabin was only 1/4 full. Nonetheless the crew made sure they did whatever they could. I was particularly impressed that I was offered a selection of teas.",Boeing 767-300,Business,Business Class,SLC to CDG,December 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes

I travelled with my 80 year old mother who lives in a different state than me, and who does not know how to use the kiosk. There were 3 ladies behind the check in counter huddled up talking and giggling like school girls. We stepped to the counter and asked to be checked in. A rude woman said, did you try the kiosks?! I stated, ""No. My mother is 80 years old and does not know how to use them, so we would like to check in here"". She gave us a bad attitude while her friends still stood there doing nothing to help other passengers, by maybe calling them over to their empty check in stations. There used to be something we called ""customer service"". Apparently, American Airlines would rather pay staff to stand around and *watch customers use the kiosk*, rather than offer assistance to elderly passengers, who remember the days of checking in at the counter with a live friendly agent, not an robot?! I was furious my mother was treated this way. To top it off, they also put us in separate seating rows at checkin, yet when I booked our tickets, I had chosen seats together online. I had to have another agent at the gate correct the seating arrangement, where we were then sat in the very back row against the toilet walls where seats did not recline, not the prechosen seats we paid for and were ticketed to sit in on our reservations.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Dallas,April 2019,1.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,no

So, the cost of transporting two pieces of luggage back from Mexico to Vancouver now stands at $100US. Outrageous.

The B777-300 looked a bit tired compared to the B777-300ER, seat pitch seemed tighter, the entertainment screen was cracked and did not fully respond, the headsets were awful - seeming to increase engine noise and necessitating deafening volume to hear anything on screen. The seat cushion was a bit lacking in padding. Wine arrived early but from about climb out and for nearly 3 hours we experienced severe turbulence and in spite of regular calls for seat belts to be fastened and even the crew having to return to their seats for lengthy periods the service was somehow maintained. Dinner this time was king prawns with rice and greens in sweet chile sauce and better than we have often had in business class. The approach to Lisbon was equally bumpy but finishing with an excellent smooth landing about 20 minutes late.

Before I even left LAX I knew my flight home from SFO would be over 1.5 hours late. That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service. And while I was given B51 on the earlier flight to LAX I still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating. Checking in early is key!,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes

I have been offered a $400 voucher in compensation of all of these however when I tried to use it, they said it's not valid for anything other than booking new flights.

It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me.

Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight.

You could purchase snacks on board, however for the price we paid, we would not have expected this budget airline style behavior from a Star Alliance member airline. Moreover, even though we were supposed to fly on the Boeing 787, the flight was on a very old (Singapore Airlines decommissioned) Boeing 777 with an antique entertainment system (to be fair the website did warn us about this fact before ticket purchase). Other than that, legroom was fine and the seats were as you would expect from a very old 777: not that comfortable, but tolerable.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Honolulu,August 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,10.0,A Lewis,24th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | We are happy to report an excellent experience with American Airlines. We took a long-anticipated vacation to D.C. and the flight there was on time and very nice to inexperienced travelers. The flight was good and we were comfortable. They handed out snacks and a drink to passengers. Unfortunately, our trip was cut short due to an unexpected death in the family. My mom had also been hospitalized after learning of the death, so I just wanted to get home asap. I called American Airlines to help change our plans for an emergency flight home, and the woman who helped us was so kind and patient as we were still reeling from the news and trying to make a decision whether to take an early flight with a layover or take one in the afternoon. They waived change fees that would have been over $400 and just charged us less than $20 for the difference in the ticket costs. The woman from American Airlines handled everything, and got us home at the earliest possible time we could get out. We are inexperienced fliers and have never had a transfer. The ticket agents helped us figure everything out. When our flight was delayed due to weather I started to panic for fear of missing out connecting flight, and the steward was so helpful and kind - The transfer ended up getting off and then getting back on the same plane so we didn't have to worry about missing the connecting plane! Thank you American Airlines - we felt like people, never like sheep.",,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington DC to Minneapolis,August 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0,yes

Qatar Airways,5.0,W Utomo,18th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | After an outbound trip which was good, we had slight issue during the inbound trip. First off, start with the check in process at MUC. Arriving 3 hours before flight, it took us 1.5 hours to get the boarding pass. 30-40 people waiting in the line, and only 1 counter is available to do the check in. We and other people ending up boarding last on the plane. Upon arrival for transit at DOH, we were greeted with the sign that passengers to KUL please report to staff. We learned, from the first staff that our flight was overbooked by 50 people. For pax from Munich, they decided to bump us to the next flight. They offered us $250 voucher (not cash) and get on the next plane which will arrive 8 hours later. As that means we will miss the connecting flight and they do not offer to compensate for that connecting flight, we refused the offer. Also, how come it impacted us when we checked in successfully not even 6 hours before. There were several group of passengers. Then the story change, it is not overbooked but technical difficulties. After heated arguments with the ground staff, we indeed can get into the plane, the seat next to me at the plane is empty.

Southwest Airlines,,C Tirrell,28th July 2011,My wife and I have flown Southwest often in the past. We've watched the past couple years as Southwest has made cutbacks and the value of their service has declined. Our primary frustration with Southwest comes from a recent flight where we were abandoned in the Denver airport. We arrived at our departure gate in Austin to find the plane running late. When we landed in Denver I checked our connection to see that it was boarding. We arrived to see they had closed the door. We were frustrated that they wouldn't hold the plane for a few minutes to allow connecting passengers to board. We spent the night in a chilly airport and offered no dinner or breakfast voucher.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Robert Mcshane,29th December 2016,âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to Los Angeles. Utterly disappointed in American Airlines service. First the website told us all seats were taken except additional cost seats at $90. They made us check in at airport and stand in a long line of surly employees to be told that there were actually many available seats at no additional cost. Duplicitous and inconvenient. Next we were told no overheard space for carry ons was left and had to check our carry ons and pick them up at baggage claim. Also ridiculous. AA knows exactly how many people and bags they have - they only run out of space by letting people fill overhead bins with jackets etc. Irresponsible. I would try hard never to fly with these unhappy employees nor this third rate airline. On a humanistic note: there was a Spanish speaking woman in line next to us who was repeatedly dismissed and sent to the back of the line because no one would bother to call one of the many bilingual employees to assist her. I am disappointed to have my family vacation begin on this note.,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MCO toLAX,December 2016,3.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,1.0,no

Chauffeur drive pick up worked perfectly and check in was very quick. I was seated in my pre-booked aisle seat in the 777-300ER which serves the morning flight from Manchester (the other 2 flights are operated by an A380). Fast track security worked like a dream. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked. I had collected my luggage, done some duty free shopping and was in my limo within 40 minutes of touch down.

Before departing the airplane, the pilot informed passengers that all flights to Washington were cancelled and to proceed to ticketing. So once I cleared customs, I went upstairs to the ticketing counter and after spending almost an hour in line, I was told my flight to IAD had been cleared. It was around 4:15pm. So they took my baggage and told me to proceed to the gate. I had to go through security again. After spending over 3 hours at the gate, I was informed again the flight had been cancelled. Customer Service said that Southwest had only two flights to IAD on 8/16 and the flights were full and they could get me on a flight on Tuesday. I understand the issue with air traffic control, however FAA stated computers were back in service at 4 pm on 8/15. Southwest only had three to four flights to IAD and my flight was at 8:55 pm. So with only four flights, Southwest could not get the later flights to IAD out? I'm stuck in an airport on standby but the only thing Southwest say is sorry, it wasn't our fault. Southwest needs to do a better job with its flights and with IAD being a major airport, more flights to and from are needed. Southwest also need to branch out to ORD and contract with other airlines to assist in situations like this. Having customers wait for three days to catch another flight without any form of compensation is unacceptable.

American Airlines,3.0,C Sanders,6th September 2014,We flew from Manchester to New York at the end of August as a couple. We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service.

Customer Service standards also seem to be slipping. On arrival at the airport I was informed my flight was delayed 3 hours but wasn't told that an earlier flight was also delayed and I could have caught that one and still made an onward connection. The previous couple of flights also had delayed arrivals (up to 2 hours) and therefore incredibly rushed connections (with onward flight delayed to wait for connecting passengers).

Qatar Airways,9.0,C Hollis,28th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Birmingham to Manila via Doha return in economy class. Overall a pleasant experience across the four sectors flown with only one delay of less than 30 minutes due to a passenger feeling unwell. The BHX-DOH sectors were on a B787, which was probably starting to show its age. For example the AVOD system on these planes is not as sleek as on the B777 which were used for the DOH-MNL sectors, however both provided a good selection of movies both new and old, TV shows, music and games. Seats are generally comfortable although the box for the AVOD system cuts into legroom if you are seated by the aisle or window. The recline is good on both planes as the lower portion of the seat moves forward slightly as the back portion reclines, giving slightly more recline overall. The quality of the food was generally excellent across all sectors, however I was disappointed that on three of the four sectors my first choice was unavailable by the time I was served. On one occasion the air stewardess did make up for this slightly by offering me a crew meal which was similar, however it would be better if the meal choices were available to more of the passengers. Drinks were available throughout the flights although in between meal service you need to go to the galley and ask. We were provided with an amenity kit on the DOH-MNL sectors which included an eye mask, travel socks, toothpaste, toothbrush and lip balm. Free Wi-Fi was available for a limited time on all sectors although the speed on the DOH-MNL sectors was much better - again this might be due to the age of the aircraft. USB ports were available on both planes to charge devices.

Qatar Airways,7.0,R Taylor,14th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Qatar is still a great airline overall, but declining in some areas. Onboard service is fantastic, flight attendants are the best in the business, hard-working and hospitable in every way. The food is good. The seats on the A350 are nice, the B777 less so. The IFE on the A350 is great and easy to use. The B777 less so. At JFK, we were delayed leaving. The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through. Security screening can be hit and miss.

Virgin America,3.0,Paul Eveloff,21st February 2014,Outgoing SFO-JFK. Return JFK-SFO. The seating comfort legroom food quality and selection and entertainment on Virgin America has declined over the last year from my personal rating of Very Good to Great to Disappointing at Best and Very Uncomfortable. Seat size and legroom as a standard have declined markedly and steadily. Both of my recent flights on American and United have had better seats more leg room and much better food. The selection of videos and entertainment has decreased. Lastly is the food - it is cheap. The choice of entrees are worse than you can find in a gas station. Regardless of the abysmal conditions currently on VA the people are uniformly very nice and do the best they can. I paid an extra $399 on this trip to upgrade to first class after I boarded the plane and found that I could not turn my shoulders in a standard exit row seat with a seat mate of normal weight and size as am I. A big price to pay just to be able to have room for my laptop. Food was OK but nothing close to the many other first class meals I've had.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Met by Qatar Airways staff at my taxi, and they unloaded my luggage and escorted me to a check in desk. Check in, dedicated security and passport check was very speedy. Once in the departure lounge, I did have a little trouble finding the Al Mourjan business lounge. It's up an escalator, just to the left of the big yellow teddy bear. Superb lounge. Flight departed on time from Gates D - please be aware that the D gates are a long walk from the lounge - the terminal shuttle train is not yet running. Aircraft configured 2-2-2 and we took 2 together by the window and aisle. The seats are fully lie flat, but the foot space is a little small. The seats in row one seemed to have a larger foot rest area. The inflight entertainment had a lot less choice than on the Boeing 787. No wifi on this plane. The dining experience was the same as on my previous report from Manchester to Doha but the menu was different. As the flight departed at 2.30am, we chose a light meal and then had something more substantial near the end of the flight. On demand dining allowed you to chose what you want and when you have it.

Lufthansa,8.0,S Gethin,19th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I did a return flight from Dublin to Cape Town via Frankfurt. On both outward and return all flights were excellent. I flew Economy on all 4 flights. I booked and paid extra for my seat which was 16k on the outward journey from Frankfurt to Capetown and 16A on the return to Frankfurt. This row was directly behind Premium Economy. From what I could see it is better to spend the money on the seat rather than PE. I had more legroom than those in PE. The food wasn't great but airline food is always hit and miss. The service from the flight attendants was superb. Nothing was too much trouble.

Meal service consisted of a warm dish (chicken with vegetables and wedges) a roll with butter rice pudding and a small bottle of water followed by two rounds of drinks. LH still has one of the most generous choices of free drinks non-alcoholic of any kind plus red and white wine sparkling wine beer etc. Announcements from the cockpit were short clear and informative.

Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777.

Not flatbed but angled - no comfort in any position left me arriving with back pain and exhausted by lack of sleep. Unfortunately I get to enjoy it all again on the return trip in 10 days.

So I get on the plane, after takeoff I grabbed my book and found my original boarding pass with a seat that the attendant just gave a free earpiece to, and I was just charged for one. I realized she had given my seat away to someone else and give me a broken seat. When I point it out to the flight attendant she said there's nothing they can do for me that the flight is full (with empty first class seats of course) however she will send a red code to the counter at the exit, and go talk to an agent when landed which I did - at the counter in FLL she completely ignored me.

I recently traveled overseas from Philadelphia to Athens with my family. Firstly, I expected anyone with children to be among the first to be boarded. I was, I believe the only one with a 9 month old baby in addition to my 3 1/2 year old toddler. To my surprise, and I'm sure the other parents, we never heard a ""anyone with young children, please feel free to board"" call. Secondly, I was extremely aggravated and angered that I couldn't get the bassinet and seat that goes with it for my baby and I. I called American Airlines weeks before and even 24 hours before my flight, not to mention my Travel Agent who requested that seat for me when they booked my tickets, and was told that ""we don't reserve the bassinet",,,,,,,,,,,,
Delta Air Lines,3.0,K Peng,1st June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | New Orleans to San Jose with Delta. Very disappointed and frustrated with Delta. This was the first time I have had such a bad experience flying. I was supposed to arrive home by Monday evening, but the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to mechanical failure so I would be missing my connection. I was rerouted to go home via a different airport, but that flight was also delayed by 2 hours due to weather. After standing in line for 45 minutes and spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was rescheduled for a flight out the following morning. Delta at least covered the accommodation, but I had to contact my work last minute. I thought the saga had ended when I arrived back at the airport the next morning. I was in for a surprise. I called the central help line to see if I could get my bag checked for free, since I had purchased liquid souvenirs after passing security the day before. The agent on the phone said they would maybe reimburse me, but thankfully noticed that my flight out that morning was delayed by 2 hours. She made a very deft, last minute move to rebook me for an earlier flight out through a different city and I had to run through security to make that flight. Having reached my layover city en route home a day later than expected, I thought, ""I'm finally on my way."" However, Delta had the wrong flight information posted at the gates. I was not aware of the mixup until my name was called over the intercom for the final boarding call. I rushed to the correct gate and barely made it onto the aircraft on time. I was very very upset at this point. I had to conclude that since I had never experienced this type of delay-after-delay-after-mistakes before flying with other airlines, that it must be something to do with Delta. I would not fly Delta ever again. I am now home, 15 hours later than my original itinerary and exhausted from all the stress, uncertainty, and frustration.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MSY to SJC,2016-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no

Flying from or into Punta Cana, this means that we had many hours without food and with very little to drink as one is not allowed to pack anything to bring through TSA. To compound that when the Manchester flight was canceled due to fog we were left with no time to get any food either.

United Airlines,5.0,D James,8th July 2014,Our flight from Anchorage was to depart around 8.35 or so but delayed 2 hours due to electrical issues. Repairs made and flight was smooth and safe. But this put many people into flux because of missed connections. Houston airport was a total mess with people milling around and scrambling for standby options. We had a package of frozen fish we did not care to lose. We would approach the podiums for standby only to be advised the flight was already overbooked. On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees. Some were very nice and helpful but many but totally burned out and fighting with each other. This is a nasty situation and I encourage another airline at the moment.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,no

Emirates,4.0,Karla Gotting,1st September 2014,Flew ADL-DXB-BHX return on 777 all the way. Seats felt smaller (not sure if they are) and the service was below average. I had to ask numerous times for a drink on the long let the seat belt signs were on for 8 hours so I could not help myself to water but they did not bring trays of water/juice around regularly either. Everything seemed to be too much trouble. On the return leg from BHX-DXB the flight was not full and many women with children moved away from their sleeping husbands to sit next to other customers who were probably hoping to curl up on the extra seat. They allowed their children to claw the hair of passengers in front and change channels of those behind. They were not asked to return to their seats and one even changed a nappy on the seat and at no time was approached by cabin crew. The food was fairly awful and I was forgotten for over an hour when they ran out of my choice (though I was happy to have anything). It wasn't cheap $2400 AUD return but they are direct from Adelaide.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,1.0,no

The lounge at Doha is okay but didn't blow me away as expected from reading various reviews, it was very busy both times I was there and I found it to be quite soulless and uninteresting.

United Airlines,8.0,J Diaz,22nd August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Washington to Barcelona with United. It is generally true for United that things were better in pre-Continental merger but it all ain't that bad either. I have flown the B767-400ER and B777 on several transatlantic routes this summer in both classes. I was surprised at how much more comfortable the B764 was as compared to the B777. The B777 felt packed (3-3-3 configuration in coach and awkward backward facing seats in business), while the B764 felt very spacious, clean and modern (2-3-2 in coach and 2-1-2 in business, all forward facing and not too many seats, so quieter). There were also no bothersome IFE equipment boxes under the window seats in coach. I would recommend searching routes that operate the B764 over the B777 - I really believe it is superior in terms of cabin layout and passenger comfort. BusinessFirst very comfortable flat bed seats (I am 179cm). Food quality ok, the main course was very good (beef with steamed vegetables) as well as the cheese and desert (nice detail they cut the cheese at your seat, so it feels fresh). The starter salad was very uncreative and plain bad actually, and no olive oil option as a dressing. But OK, it's an US airline so just don't expect any proper food to come out of that. Food in coach was also good with 3 separate serving rounds for appetiser, meal and desert+coffee. Great idea to hand out water bottles before the sleeping phase of the flight. Next time I will opt for the express dining option in business, as the full dining service takes so much time that you have little left for sleeping. Some people argue the seat configuration in business should be 1-2-1 rather than 2-1-2, but I disagree, while 1-2-1 is perfect for solo business travelers as everyone has isle access, I feel that when traveling with my partner (or any other person) I want to sit together by the window, so 2-1-2 does make sense to me. The business experience in United may not be up to the standards of European and Asian carriers, but (at least on my flights) you also pay less, so I think it offers great value for money. Would fly in United BusinessFirst again, but preferably on the B764.",Boeing 767-400ER,Business,Business Class,IAD to BCN,August 2016,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,yes

The main problem is that the Lufthansa website does not allow to choose your seat on the planes operated by ANA and online check-in is only available 24 hours before flight. Therefore you might get the worst seats on the plane. Most airlines allow you to at least choose your site on code shared flights but Lufthansa does not.

I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac.

I do get that fly attendants are not waiters but trained professional here to assure our security, but having them smile is much appreciated. We were a bit late, it may be only 20 minutes but it shortened my connecting time. Second flight from Frankfurt to Hong Kong was not good. Being served last and not having a choice of meal is something I do not care about. I was pretty close to the galley and could hear FA's chatting/giggling very loudly for most of the flight, and they should have cared a bit more. Most of them were quite cold and they were not serving drinks enough. The seats weren't comfortable, and once the front seat reclines it feels way too cramped, I was surprised it could be reclined that much. Sit back and enjoy the Lufthansa entertainment programme is more like sit back and enjoy your own device.

American Airlines,1.0,G Chaplin,28th March 2015,I flew Manchester to JFK and return with AA. On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all.

Great seats which recline enough to relax in economy. Enough TV shows and movies which kept me entertained and for my wife who prefers things in Arabic there was also subtitles on mostly everything for her. What we did do to make things a little easier was the first leg Paris to Dubai I purposely selected a flight with the 13 hour layover so we left France in the morning arrived Dubai around 8pm. Explored the shops visited the spa for a massage then stayed in the Airport Hotel over night for our connecting flight the next morning. It was the first time I had done it this way normally just allowing 2-3 hours wait between flights but then usually you are so tired on that second flight you sleep and in economy its not the most comfortable which ever airline you choose as you are not in a lie flat bed.

The seats were good for Economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. The service in Business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average.

American Airlines,1.0,Rich Claar,30th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | American Airlines flight from Milwaukee to Chicago was showing as delayed by 35 minutes upon our arrival to airport. No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere. Again, more issues. We finally arrived at our destination over 7 hours late (which is big in a short 4 day vacation). The experience was terrible all around. So much so that we are looking at cancelling our Citi Advantage card and never flying AA again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Chicago via Charlotte,March 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

After 1/2 hr got connected and agent said nothing can be done and that my son's rebooked for next day. They wouldn't rebook on any other airline w/o Air Canada flight numbers even though United and USAir are partners in the Star Alliance. What I'm most upset about is the no notification of cancellation - agent checked and said system shows ""text not sent"".

So I now have to book two extra nights accommodation and there were no alternative flights either day each side of my flights. Air New Zealand have basically said too bad, zero compensation, no free accommodation for those nights, no meal tickets, nothing.

Emirates,5.0,I Jansen,30th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard, most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When youâ€™re in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - youâ€™re going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, youâ€™re almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 2008-2013 era will ever return. They have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen (which I donâ€™t even use because I prefer to sleep).",A380,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Dubai,March 2018,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no
Southwest Airlines,,Luke Bailey,1st July 2014,"Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay. Southwest cannot and will not do the same.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,,,,2.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Alexander Sanchez-Lopez,22nd April 2015,My family and I were traveling on March 27 on flight AA 238 from (DCA) Washington Ronald Reagan National D.C. at 5.35 pm to (MIA) Miami International Airport. The airplane was old. We could see where the paint was chipped on the right wing. We had seats 15D 15E and 15F. The seat next to the window would not move back up after it was inclined back. We were landing and we pressed the button and could not get the seat to move back in an upright position. A male flight attention called my attention and I said I could not move it. He said that seats on American were more aesthetic than they are functional. The airplane lacked tray tables. Accordingly when served drinks there was no place to put the drinks. Furthermore not only were tray tables absent from this old plane but even the lock to hold them in place was gone from the plane. The plane had not been properly cleaned before the flight and our flight was overbooked. The seats were very narrow even though we paid for more better seats. My mother who is of normal weight and body proportions had difficulty getting in and out of it.

The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport.

Emirates,7.0,J Choi,30th December 2013,LHR-HKG via DXB. The seat pitch was surprisingly generous aboard the A380 EK006 from Heathrow to Dubai. The ICE entertainment was superb the staff were friendly and the catering was above average. What I disliked the most was the boarding 'process' they had to make it sound 'so grand'. I sat at the front and by the time I boarded and requested for eyeshades they were gone already. Also it is very hard to hear what the guy was saying as there were a battle of voices between our flight and the Qantas flight at the next gate. The queues for transfer were very long in Dubai but it was pretty inefficient. However it takes 40 minutes to get from the first gate to the second although at a leisurely pace. The second flight from DXB-HKG was far more horrible. We had to endure the horrendous 3-4-3 configuration. The ICE entertainment on the 777-300 was not as modern as the A380 thus the person behind me had to press the screen with tremendous force every time to get his TV working. The screens were also far smaller and much harder to operate. But in terms of service it was really average.

Check in was uneventful at LAXâ€™s Terminal 2 and the Maple Leaf Lounge was very run of the mill. The 16hr ultra-long-haul flight was superb from embarkation to curbside. Qatar Airways shines with the onboard service, meals and wine. Food quality was outstanding and it was great to dine on demand on this super long flight â€“ I ate three times. Service is top notch being professional, prompt and always accommodating. The seats are large and super comfortable, with mattress, soft pillow and blanket. Only downside was I had a window seat so I did have to jump over the legs of fellow seat mate. To me a small price to pay for such a huge bed. Arriving into Doha was seamless with separate customs and immigration that looked more like a lounge than a normal customs area. This trip was definitely 5 stars â€“ the return flight was completely different.",Boeing 777-200LR,Business,Business Class,LAX to DOH,2016-05-01 00:00:00,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Virgin America,2.0,T Nienow,15th November 2013,Main Cabin Select is comfortable and they throw in enough amenities including priority TSA lines to make it worth the extra price. Main Cabin is not a good experience. The seats are really small and close together and they make you pay for everything. The DISH Network TV is free but the programming is very mediocre and on my flight the sound kept going out. They also constantly interrupt your viewing with announcements which get pretty grating when it's pumped directly into your head. Southwest's regular seats are significantly more comfortable than Virgin America's Main Cabin and JetBlue give you free snacks. The flight crew were courteous but there's far too much activity in the cabin with the flight attendants bringing snacks and drinks to passengers on almost a continual basis because everyone can place orders on their TV screens.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Delta Air Lines,6.0,P Stern,8th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Papeete via Los Angeles, the flight to Tahiti with Air France. Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Tahiti. We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly. Flying out of Minneapolis on Delta we sat on the tarmac for over and hour because of mechanical/electrical issues. Even tho the issue was not fixed, de-icing proceeded and we left for take off. Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation. Trust me you do not want to shop in Tahiti on a Sunday for toothpaste/toothbrushes and swimsuits. Thank you Delta, it is much appreciated. On a side note, I would fly Delta again and also Air France where the service and food were exceptional, even back in steerage.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Tahiti via Los Angeles,February 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,yes

Emirates,1.0,A Danal,22nd October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay. If you have an issue on the flight don't count on dealing with their complaints team after as they wont offer you anything, try and get what you want while your on the flight.",A380,Business,Business Class,DXB to MAN,September 2016,4.0,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,,Claudia Paz,29th December 2013,We made reservations way in advance prepaid our flights and chose the seats that best accommodated our needs. Delta then changed the flights on several occasions and reassigned our seats giving us the worst possible seating even having our kids separate from us. We called customer service and were told they could not do anything that they are not allowed to change other people's seats. That is exactly what they did to us! We learned our lesson the hard way and we hope to never have to fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,10.0,M Patapong,10th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Before my flight, I have spoken to their Twitter. They respond within an hour, and if they don't, they apologise. During check in, it was chaotic and took me an hour. I understand since it's the big A380. The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic. Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy. She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me. On the flight to bangkok, there was a Malaysian flight attendant who was also very nice and talkative (I'm also talkative) so we had too much conversation, she wasn't able to service other passengers. Overall, an amazing experience unlike any other airline.

Air Canada,3.0,David Butcher,13th May 2014,Flew YVR-MUC on LH and LHR-YVR on AC in May 2014. Have flown BA long haul many times in last year mainly on old 747s. For a while AC had really improved their product making it better than BA. Not any more. The new AC high density 777-300 on the YVR-LHR route is awful In business the Pods are gone. The seat pitch is much reduced. The seat is poorly constructed and difficult to change position. The table is bizarre - spring loaded and very difficult to put back. The lie flat is not comfortable and has no privacy. You have to climb over the aisle passenger to get out. This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks. The staff however were very professional. Overall the experience was much poorer than LH's new business class on the A330. I wont use this plane again by choice.

Being a night flight, the Emirates staff not only failed to request them to tone down in consideration to other passengers. But what shocked most passengers is to see one of the Emirates staff is part of the noise making throughout the flight with the 3 men. Seated herself at the crew exit seat facing them. Extremely unprofessional for any staff to act in this manner by disregarding passengers comfort. Next, the food was poorly presented. Budget airlines like AirAsia has better food.

The overall seat was superior to anyone else's business class I have been on. The food and beverage service was excellent. Appetizing decent portions well served and proper temperature.

I miss the times when bread was just that bread, made with water, yeast and flour. The entertainment is a bit annoying as you are forced to view 2 commercials prior to any movies or TV episodes.

Emirates,1.0,L Salter,15th February 2016,"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead!",A380,Family Leisure,Business Class,BNE to LHR via DXB,December 2015,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good.

The outbound was 10 out 10 due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc. I took advantage of the free Istanbul Tour offered by the Turkish Airlines. For the return leg the flight was delayed by 7.5 hours due to foggy conditions at Dhaka which obviously is not Turkish's fault. I was put on a different connecting flight to London which was supposed to depart within 1 hour of the arrival of the Dhaka flight to Istanbul. However the flight took 8.5 hours instead of 7 hours which meant that I missed the London flight. But what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this 8.5 hour flight. If Turkish is to compete with the other Airlines (Emirates Qatar Etihad) flying to Dhaka it has to take the Istanbul-Dhaka-Istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,yes

Arrive at airport checking in to Porter Air, they tell me my flights are being deleted and I need to call Qatar. Finally, Air Canada reaches me and for some reason I was moved from Porter which I booked, and now was placed on Air Canada (a company I try to avoid). I contact customer service once in Thailand on my trip to inquire about the screw up. They tell me all is fine and this was not an issue. I try to check in before flight going home, can't check in. Can't contact Qatar, their phone number is in Doha and I am not paying to call them for poor service. Arrive at airport 2hrs and 20min before flight.

Firstly, the airline allowed a passenger that was not on the flight onto the flight and did not notice until we were about to take off. Secondly, in this process the plane ran out of gas. The crew were very poor at addressing these problems and the passengers were left in the dark through out most of this delay.

I flew Cathay in First from LAX-HKG R/T just a few days earlier and felt that this experience was on par with CX First and in some areas even better - and that says a lot as CX is world class.

Right from the pre departure drinks service to the excellent restaurant style (and quality) meals to the amenities on board (excellent Ferragamo and Armani kits mattress pads duvets pyjamas superb champagnes) to the crew and the world class new lounge at Hamad - this was an experience! The Business/First lounge at Hamad is huge (not Emirates huge) but manageable. The shower amenities (L'Occitane) and the restaurants in the lounge are excellent (yes Krug is still being served in the business restaurant). The bus transfer (once) was in a bus with 8 lounge style sofa seats. A good way to start the new year!,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,9.0,B Loewenstein,8th March 2016,"First time to use Lufthansa new Premium Economy on this long 12 hr flight to Cancun. The seat comfort is a mayor plus compared to the standard Economy Class. Nowadays there are so many Premium Economy or Economy Plus concepts that you don't know what to expect. Lufthansa has done a great job. It's an almost independent class with very comfy seats. The seat offers 18 cm more legroom, is wider and has a relatively big tray table (comparable to that one in Business Class), power sockets and IFE on high definition touch screens. The service was very professional, friendly and efficent. The purser of this flight welcomed us personally. On this A340 the Premium Economy consists of only 19 seats and has it's own compartment. It is quiet and you can deboard quickly after arrival. The food is almost the same than in Economy Class, but served on china and with a menu and some real glasses. After boarding you get a non-alcoholic juice cocktail. Food quality and quantity was fine. You get plenty of drinks. IFE and WIFI worked also really good. At your seat there is a water bottle and nice amenity kit. The flight was almost one hour ahead of schedule. It was a great experience.

Jetblue Airways,1.0,Y Ling,16th October 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Nassau to New York JFK. This is by far the worst experience I had with jet blue. Also like to fly with them but on the way back to the Bahamas there was engine failure. The flight was canceled. On top of that they wanted us to fly out the next morning to FL then catch a flight from FL back to JFK. I booked a non stop ticket and we wanted to get home. So we had to fly to FL and then go back to JFK the same day. Did not get in til 12:30 and got home at 2 AM. Called them up to see what they can do for us and they ended up giving us 175 per person credit. That will expire in 365 days and we have to fly with them again. This really did put a bad taste in my mouth after flying with them for so long. I donâ€™t think I would ever fly with them again. They can take the 175 credit and eat it. All the hours I spent at the airport and had to do a layover to get home and I get 175 back. Total joke! I guess JetBlue does not care about customer service.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,John Peters,26th October 2015,"My wife and I flew in Turkish Airlines premium economy from Toronto to Istanbul. Boarding was orderly and the flight left on time out of YYZ. Service on the outbound flight was good and the larger premium economy seats which recline allowed us to sleep on this night time flight. Food was above average. However, the return flight was not nearly so happy. The flight out of Istanbul was delayed (which happens) and there was chaos in the waiting hall. Then it turned out that the aircraft wasn't able to come to the bridge which meant we had to be bussed to the plane which was in the cargo area a long distance from the terminal. The ground crew never explained to us why the airplane couldn't come to the bridge. So all of the passengers had to walk to the end of the bridge and down fairly steep metal stairs to the tarmac. There were a number of elderly women who had a very difficult time negotiating the stairs and, so far as I could tell, they never got any assistance from airline staff. I ending up helping one older lady down the stairs. The return flight is during the day and after serving us a quite acceptable meal the flight attendants disappeared for about 6 hours.

FastTrack was quick and the Skyteam Lounge at Terminal 4 Heathrow is excellent. Boarding was efficient with priority very clear for Sky Priority passengers. The short flight to Amsterdam was very good with a high quality snack and very friendly crew. Arrival at Schipol was 20 minutes early. Unfortunately Schipol Airport is undergoing refurbishment which makes it something of a mess but the lounge was welcoming and not too crowded. Boarding from Gate E7 was very disappointing. It was a mess. Everyone had to go thru a security check and the queues were long. Then once thru security it was standing room only. Boarding was just a rugby scrum as people tried to get out of the claustrophobic boarding area. On board the Dubai flight the crew were very welcoming. Departure was on time and the on board product was very good. I am used to the KLM Business Class seat and while it may not be a flat bed it is fine for the approx. 6 hour flight to Dubai.

Air New Zealand,5.0,G Brennan,25th November 2015,"Singapore to Auckland on Boeing 787. Felt crammed with seats and very narrow aisles. Sitting by the aisle meant being bumped and pushed by people going past including one of the cabin crew â€“ a big man who banged into me every time he passed and kicked my foot once with never an apology. Seat pitch was OK because the seats are very thin with little padding. Seat belts arenâ€™t very long and if youâ€™re a larger person the buckle is under the armrest which is uncomfortable and awkward to access. IFE was good but no inflight magazine and no entertainment listing. All you get is a food price list and a safety card which was better than the All Blacks safety video. Explored the onscreen offerings which werenâ€™t well laid out. I stumbled on a good TV program that popped up on the screen but couldnâ€™t find tell my partner how to access it. Thereâ€™s no menu card or indication of what meals and drink service is offered. As one of the cabin crew grumpily instructed the passenger next to us, you have to use the online screen to order a drink. Having figured it out I ordered two drinks and some vege chips (the only food item besides a pre-packed cookie available without paying for it). After a while one of the drinks arrived but not the other one. We asked if it was coming and were told it should be. However it didnâ€™t. Eventually my partner decided to order it again but theyâ€™d closed the kitchen. So I rang and asked for the drink. Steward wasnâ€™t happy but finally came back took the order and went and fetched the drink. The food was mediocre served with plastic cutlery on tiny trays. The sparkling and the white wine was shocking quality. The cabin crew service was perfunctory and bored. We never once saw any of them smile and I barely got a muttered Sorry when a stewardess split wine on me. What a contrast to our flight on Singapore Airlines a fortnight earlier when smiling, pleasant staff welcome you on board and offer hot towels before you even take off. You get inflight magazines with a full entertainment guide, complimentary socks/toothpaste amenities in a little zip bag, pre-dinner drinks service with nuts, a printed menu listing the meals, drinks and snacks offered, and proper meal try with metal cutlery. We havenâ€™t travelled Air New Zealand for a while and wonâ€™t be again. It felt like a budget airline cutting costs at every opportunity.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Aleksander Saeth,30th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Oslo to Dhaka via Istanbul return. I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only). Turkish would rather exploit it's customers. The irony is that this very trip was the one that earned me the last points for a membership upgrade.

Delta Air Lines,5.0,Farouk Mogheth,23rd December 2013,"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers.

After two and a half hours we were told the plane was fixed and that we would be taking off. 30 minutes later we were told they didn't have any flight attendants and if we waited a few minutes the replacement flight attendants were in the airport and on their way.

How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. I was second in line when they asked us not to be in line, why would they announce for us to get out of line and then tell us we have to get back in line and then tell most people, sorry there's no hotel. Several of the United staff were clearly upset and they just stopped helping people and when I finally got to the front I was treated poorly. I was asked why am I here and when I told them about the flight delay they said they didn't know anything about it and that they had just got there. I asked for my hotel voucher and they had to check to see if they could help me. I received a hotel voucher and by the time I got to the hotel there was enough time for 2 hours of sleep.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Stephen Kelly,19th October 2015,"My wife and I and baby daughter (1 year old) flew with Turkish Airlines from Dublin to Dammam via Istanbul in September. When I initially booked our flight I was informed basinettes could not be booked in advance but would be allocated at check-in. At Check-in at Dublin airport all basiinettes for the first leg of our journey from Dublin to Istanbul had already been taken which was annoying but ok with us. However, the second leg of the journey from Istanbul to Dammam, we were informed by the check-in person that she was unable to allocate the basinette seats for us since it had been 'closed' out from her system, even though this flight wasn't due to depart for another 13 hours. We were allocated seats for the second leg in row 29. On boarding the second flight I noticed that one set of basinettes seats were occupied by a man and woman who had no child with them. I brought this to the attention of the nearest cabin crew and she informed me that she would notify the senior purser. Of course nothing happened, no one came to me, no one offered an apology or an explanation. I made an online complaint about this and other issues also, to Turkish Airlines but got nowhere with them",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aircraft was clean, food was tasty and the entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies but not as good as Emirates and Qatar Airways. The return leg (Dhaka-Istanbul) was flown by an older A330, the entertainment system didn't work for at least 2 hours in the whole plane, and the screen was not so good. Food was again tasty but quantity not enough. Overall I enjoyed Turkish Airlines. It was better than expected but not as good as Qatar Airways and Emirates and that's mostly because of the crew.

So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Benjamin Podszun,8th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Frankfurt to Singapore via Istanbul. FRA-IST then 2.5h layover and IST-SIN. The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn't arrive in Singapore. It's missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn't state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like ""On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then",,,,,,,,,,,,

The nice thing about Lufthansa is that they are running a tight airline operation that usually doesnâ€™t leave anything to chance. The not so nice thing about Lufthansa is that being tight can quickly turn into being uptight with little wiggle room if a certain degree of flexibility is required. I was almost refused boarding because my return flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was booked for a date which happened to be beyond the extent of my 90 day visa-free stay period in the country. I understand that airlines have to adhere to the rules as stipulated by immigration laws, but ultimately the decision to allow me to board the flight rested with Lufthansaâ€™s flight manager who proved to be stubborn and neither susceptible to reasoning nor my explanation that I was not intending to spend the 5 months in Singapore but would travel in the wider region. It took almost an hour of arguing back and forth with several Lufthansa representatives before I was finally issued a boarding pass.

As someone who struggles to walk distances and has to use a walking cane I asked Emirates for ground assistance. This was agreed, confirmed and confirmed again at check in where they advised it had not been added. On boarding the aircraft when those needing time/assistance were asked to board I found myself behind at least 10 able bodied passengers jumping the queue. To add insult to injury, after getting on board, the stewardess then made me wait while one of these able bodied passengers messed around for 5 minutes. When I did get to my seat, I had spent that long standing and queuing that I was in a lot of pain. Thanks Emirates.

Excellent check-in, completed in 5 minutes by very friendly staff member, including being told the great news that I would not have to pick-up my bags and re-check them for my connecting flight at IAH (which I was told is only done at IAH). Efficient boarding. Second UA service of the day to IAH, so the flight was quite empty (ended up with all 3 seats in the middle section to myself). The 787 was still very new and presented a very clean and airy cabin, helped by the larger than normal windows and lack of passengers. Comfortable seat with an excellent headrest which folds to support your head, and stays in place! Extremely quiet in terms of cabin noise (engines). Food service was reasonable and wine and beer served for free (premium drinks charged US$7.99 to US$8.99). WiFi worked very well for the entire duration of the flight (US$20 for the duration of the flight). Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight.",Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to IAH,September 2016,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Jenny Marie,2nd June 2018,"âŒ Not Verified | New York to Wichita. After flying once before with American and not having the best experience I decided to give them another shot. On the way here the service was great, 0 delays. Granted that was Memorial Day. Flying home this morning was a pain in the ass. It started arriving to LaGuardia airport this morning with staff who seemed to not be knowledgeable of what they were doing and told me all other flights were booked (not true). My flight was supposed to leave at 1030am from LaGuardia, which turned into 1130am then to 12.50pm mind you I had been sitting st the airport since 8.30am. The only flights left to my final destination was a 10.30pm flight out of DFW meaning I would sit in DFW for 6-7 hours or more depending on delays. Turning a 6 hour travel day into a 17 hour flight day. Additionally I would have missed that flight if I would have not gotten up to go to the restroom and so happen to look at the monitor to see that the gate had changed. No communication what so ever about the gate change. We did not depart to almost 1:15pm - mind you they gave us 0 information about the whereabouts or why our flight was delayed for nearly 2 hours. Finally we made it to Dallas 3.5 hours later. At this point I was tired and irritable. Thank you to the kind woman at DFW working for AA, who got me on a flight sooner than 1030pm, she was patient, kind and emphatic. She made sure I still had my first class seat and all. She turned a very long day into a better one. But after having a experience like this in the past, AA will no longer receive my service nor would I recommend them to anyone.",,Solo Leisure,First Class,New York to Wichita,June 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no

Flight attendants were extremely rude, telling customers to be quiet and to stop asking questions. Ended up paying the moving crew for three hours to sit around, paid for a hotel the night before my flight and had to stay an additional night in a hotel because it was too late to complete the drive on the anticipated day. Contacted corporate and was given an insincere apology.

Emirates,5.0,F Marber,28th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available. There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us, we wouldn't have spent two hours on the floor. Onboard, the Business Class was in a 2-3-2 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class, I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite, but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good. No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE, there is the same ad as in Eco.

JetBlue Airways attracts it's customers with low prices for airfare as well as complimentary items such as their free 36 Direct TV channels on their in flight entertainment systems. However, while complimentary items and low airfare are nice, the customer service always needs to be a priority and that is what was lacking on Flight 602 service to Boston. Even though this was a Red-eye flight (aka an all-nighter), I believe that at the least flight attendants shouldn't be screaming for people to sit down. The attendants on this flight I can imagine probably don't like their shift but taking it out on the passengers isn't right. And while I understand that they have a tight schedule to keep they are perfectly capable of saying please and thank you every once in a while. All I have to say is that if you think low airfare and complimentary items beats Customer Service in the airline industry, then Jetblue Airways isn't so bad - but personally I prefer an airline with good customer service.",A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Boston,January 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,no

Virgin America,1.0,E Bazella,31st December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Palm Springs to San Francisco. The experience has gone from bad to worse and we havenâ€™t even boarded the flight yet. Making the reservation ended up in my having to cancel what I had already booked because they wouldnâ€™t let my small dog on that flight. So an agent in Denver assisted me in canceling that one and booking a new one. However he forgot to assign seats. When I discovered this error 2 days before the flight, I was told there were no free seats left and would have to pay $60 for premium seats. I should have fought it because it seemed like an agent error but I paid it. Then we got to the airport and paid another $100 for the bags. So for a short flight, we paid $160 just for seats and bags not including the actual flight which was around $475 including $100 for my dog. I kept getting flight status emails for the canceled flight, nothing on the new flight. Once we arrived at Palm Springs airport, the flight was to board at 4, take off at 4:42. At 4:15 and no plane at the gate, we asked the agent for an update. Then we were told thereâ€™s a mechanical problem, no plane will arrive until 5:30, take off around 6:10, an hour and a half past the scheduled time.

American Airlines,3.0,Derek Northcutt,27th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service.

United Airlines,1.0,A Ehmen Carlotta,25th June 2014,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Stephen Sacks,20th November 2014,"A lot of anticipation on flying the AC Dreamliner - a large spacious quiet aircraft that just eases the flight hours away - not - Air Canada decided to put in very small aisles tiny uncomfortable seats and an entertainment system that doesn't tilt. I'm 5'4"" and 135 pounds so if I can't fit in a seat - something is drastically wrong! And I couldn't get comfortable - the flights to/from Europe were each 12 hours of misery. How greedy could AC be as to try to fit in that many seats? The plane is already super-efficient - so having an aisle seat is awful - you will constantly get your elbows arms and feet banged by the flight attendants. Add to that - the washrooms are so small I couldn't even fit in. And the toilet seats refuse to stay up! Come on AC adding a slow-release toilet seat would cost you nothing!",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no
Turkish Airlines,1.0,G Harris,10th December 2014,Turkish Airlines staff are normally brusque and indifferent but when one of their flights is delayed they really excel themselves in terms of inscrutable disdain. Firstly TK0805 to Istanbul (5/11/14) the cabin crew didn't seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not. When we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting Turkish flight to London. So not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said 'yes it'll be held'. Everyone rushed to the gate. Low and behold it wasn't held. Sent from pillar to post to interact with various other stony-faced employees who frankly don't care. Not a single person ventured an apology.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,E Young,10th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dallas Ft Worth to Paris CDG, connecting to El Al for flight to Tel Aviv. After checking in approximately 3.5 hours prior to departure, which is ample time for international travel, and my bag being tagged as ""Priority,"" since Monday, November 7, no one can tell me with certainty where my luggage is. In CDG I was told that I needed to give the gate agents the code for my padlocks even though they are TSA approved. I complied with their request and gave them my code. Prior to arrival in Tel Aviv, I was advised by the flight attendant that my bag had not made it on the flight and to ensure that I would file a claim with El Al at the Lost Baggage counter prior to exiting the TLV airport, which I did. The agent there told me that there were two flights coming in later, and that my case would be on one of them. They gave me a bag with very basic toiletries and what looked like a short pyjama suited for my 10 year-old granddaughter. They told me that there was no allowance until after 24 hours. I was also asked to cross off from my declaration any items over $100 so I wouldn't need to return to the airport to pay duty on those items. I questioned the accuracy of her statement, but the agent who filed my claim with El Al insisted that I had to cross off on my form what I had begun to list as items over $100 in value, which I did. That was Tuesday, November 8. On Wednesday, November 9, the hotel concierge followed up on my claim. The person he spoke with said for me to get whatever I needed and to keep all receipts. That evening the concierge followed up with El Al again, who informed us that my luggage was still in Dallas! I called back and spoke with Maya, who told me American Airlines had put my luggage on a flight to Toronto and then it was scheduled to get onto an Air Canada flight to Tel Aviv. ETA was now for Thursday morning. I am joining a Holy Land tour and had gone a few days ahead to spend visiting Jerusalem. Instead, I have been wasting my time trying to track my luggage. A hotel guest relayed to the concierge and me that El Al had told her that if she wanted her luggage the day it had arrived, she would have to get a taxi to and fro the airport as their courier was no longer available, which she had no other choice but to do it. Armed with this information I hung tight by the hotel. On Thursday morning (I departed on Monday), the El Al call center for lost luggage would not put me through a manager as he was calling American Airlines liars. He said he would have a manager call me, which still has not happened. As of Thursday afternoon, American told my husband that they lost track of my luggage in Toronto and that they could not access El Al lost baggage system. El Al claims AA is lying as the lost luggage system is an international system, not El Al's. Until they physically have my case in their possession, El Al cannot do or say anything further. And besides being tagged ""Priority,"" they also have me as VIP in their system. I have lost the extra days in Israel. What promised to be a trip of a lifetime has become a nightmare for me. It is ironic that my bag was so handled by American Airlines, compounded by El Al.

In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth. Not only did I get a whole lot of extra space and privacy but extra TV monitors pillow and blankets as well. Much much better than premium economy but at no extra cost.

Then on our return flight on January 8, 2016, our flights were all delayed, starting from Santa Fee and at Denver, it was a nightmare for my mother and I. She needed wheelchair assistance and we had to request for it twice because the gates got changed, like 5 minutes we were dumped at the first gate. At the second gate, we were advised on the Departure screens that the gate was now somewhere else, even further from the original gate. In the end, my mother got fed up and walked to the last gate where we finally got a rep who was very professional and patient. The information on the Departure screen was confusing as both United and Air Canada were shown to be departing at the same gate but with 5 minutes difference. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and instead of getting into Toronto at a reasonable hour of 10.30 pm on Jan 8, we only got home at 3 am!

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1.0,S Radojevic,20th January 2014,SU106 SVO-LAX Jan 11 2014 on A330-300. This was some older version airplane I was seated in row 16 in a broken seat and virtually with virtually no legroom. Comfort absolutely inadequate for a 13 hrs flight. After takeoff we were told that we had to land in Oslo to refuel. This turned out to be a 2.5 hrs stopover since no one was informed about our landing and need for fuel. In fact Aeroflot used the opportunity to change the crew so it is very possible that this was the actual cause for the unplanned stopover. All together we spent 16 hrs in that plane and of course missed the connecting flight on DL airlines.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,no

Qatar Airways,2.0,Chris Hall,29th March 2014,Melbourne to London via Doha. Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights.

We land after a 2 hours of flying and with only a 6 minute delay. The transfer was quick. We board our flight for JFK on-time and we take-off on time. The food was good and plenty of snacks.

I asked Southwest for a refund of the Early Bird Seating fee ($20.00) sending them the hospital and rescheduling documentation. Southwest called and said they would refund $200.00 because of the medical emergency - said they did not believe in taking advantage of their customers.

Emirates,3.0,W Thant-Cyn,15th January 2014,Recently flown Emirates while on holiday with my family to Singapore and Sydney from New Zealand. I have very specific requirements when traveling due to using an electric wheelchair for mobility. Despite emailing the airline in advance with these requirements I had a distressing experience using this airline. It was awful from check-in to landing. The customer service was terrible at the check-in desk. The Emirates crew at Sydney airport were unfriendly and they were more interested in talking amongst themselves. At check-in I explained that I'd like to drive my wheelchair up to the entrance of the plane. Check-in staff made a lot of calls and eventually they assured me they were happy with my request. Having reached the gate with my family the bad service continued. The lady at the gate was surprised to see me and asked why I wasn't in a transit chair. She refused to process my boarding early. She ignored my explanation regarding my wheelchair and brought out a transit chair for me to transfer into. When I refused she made more calls and finally she allowed my family and I to continue toward the entrance of the plane. On board usually when a passenger with a disability is onboard a Cabin Service Manager (CSM) comes to say â€œhelloâ€and make sure all is OK. I was totally ignored. The food was terrible to say the least. Flight attendants did not seem interested in passengers. When we landed I had to wait for other passengers to get off first. Once the cabins were cleared I was told that a chair was on its way. 15 minutes later she showed us to a transit chair. My heart sank. I asked where my chair was and I asked that it be brought to the entrance of the plane instead. I pointed out to her that she clearly saw me board the plane with my chair and I was requesting the same procedure to happen in order for me to get off the plane. Within a few minutes my chair was brought to the plane. What could have been a very simple problem to resolve turned out to be a nightmare. I am hesitant to travel with Emirates again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,no

But when we went to Delhi airport for flight check-in on 24th April, airport officers/check-In counter told us that my infant baby ticket is suspended by United Airlines (they gave us proof also), and they canâ€™t issue boarding pass for Infant. When we contacted United Airlines customer care at same time then they told us that my infant ticket is suspended because as per united airline records my infant baby did not travel to Delhi from Newark (EWR) on 24th March 2019 and thatâ€™s why United Airline suspended my infant ticket because of no show and we missed our flight due to suspended status of infant ticket. We have Infant boarding pass(EWR to DEL), I am not sure how come a International Airline can miss something like this. Initially they told us that they donâ€™t have any seat available till 5th May and we can reissue 3 tickets for 5th May 2019 but asked to buy Infant ticket as he is turning 2 years on 1 May 2019.

The rest of the crew was OK. The airplane was one of the 737s that has not been yet revamped (N860AM). It was very uncomfortable and legroom was very tight. Armrest earphone plugs did not work, thus it was impossible to watch the inflight movie. Newer airplanes have personal TVs, and since seats are a bit thinner, there are few inches more of legroom.

After arriving in Frankfurt, due to short connection, direct transfer with a limousine was already organized. LH440 - 06/07/2015, A380. Unfortunately when arriving at the gate to Houston, plane was delayed due to technical issues. Ground staff were confused, delayed the boarding twice. Boarding started about 45 min later than normal. Due to the amount of seats in business class, there were already 2 lines of about 40 people each for the boarding process. When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH.

As it was only a three hour flight I didn't book a meal, but the people next to me did, looked okay and they said it was fine. The cabin crew kept me well topped up with mineral water, could have had tea or coffee. The cabin crew were very pleasant. More or less right time arrival, unfortunately there was no gate for us at Auckland airport so we stopped on a remote stand and were bussed to the terminal. Not really the airlines fault and it didn't take too long. The return flight was an Airbus A320 again clean, boarding commenced on time, again a clean well presented cabin. Not quite as much leg room. On time to push back a technical fault was found and a fitter had to be called resulting in a 30 minute late departure. These things happen with any machine. Due to high headwinds we had to aim for Melbourne before heading north for Brisbane. Again outside the airlines control. The meals looked ok, same menu, tea coffee and mineral water in good supply.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,D Carter,13th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew with KLM on the 3rd April from Lisbon to Newcastle via Amsterdam. Before I arrived at Lisbon Airport, I checked in online using the KLM app which was a very smooth and easy experience compared to some airline apps. On arrival at the airport I checked in my bags at the bag drop using the boarding pass which I had on my phone. The staff around check-in were absolutely fantastic, couldn't have been more helpful. As I boarded the aircraft, I was given a very friendly welcome by the cabin crew. The flight departed 15 minutes behind schedule due to an issue with ATC in Amsterdam. Once we were airborne the crew began to serve breakfast which consisted of a Dutch breakfast sandwich and a choice of drink. The sandwich was actually quite nice although the appearance did not look so tasty.

My flight here was first delayed by four hours. Then my return flight was delayed by two hours because they held a plane for another group from another city, causing me to miss my connection.

Emirates,1.0,K Ruganta,4th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai.I am disappointed with Emirates. The entertainment is excellent, the food is good, the seat is comfortable, the aircraft is clean, the staff are okay. My flight from Paris to Dubai was delayed 3 hours because of bad weather. The ground staff at Paris reassured us that we will be taken care of if we missed our connecting flight. We landed at Dubai at about 10.20 pm instead of the scheduled 9.40 pm. We need about 5-10 minutes to get off the plane and proceed to the transit area. There were 2 staff holding boards, for the Bangkok flight passengers and other destination. We checked the departure screen and read that our connecting flight was boarding. All of the Kuala Lumpur flight passengers ran to the gate, just to know that the flight had departed at 10.30 pm. We were very shocked. If it had waited 10 more minutes, all of the passangers would not be stranded at the Dubai airport, on new years eve. We were forced to queue at the ground office for hours to find our flight home. My family got lucky. We got our flight home after standing for 2 and a half hours. We were rerouted, flying from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Dhaka, using Bangladesh Airlines. We paid for Emirates, got Biman and extra trouble of tracing our baggage. Amazing way to start the year. I would be much grateful if the ground staff and the cabin staff had communicated better and at least some direction or guidance from the Emirates for the lost passengers.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,F Drexler,15th January 2016,"I had more than 20 flights on Turkish in the last 15 months, both international (European) and domestic. Out of those flights, half of them were on time with the other half were delayed by about an hour - only one had a four hour delay because of weather. As long as everything goes right, TK is a pretty good airline, but as soon as something goes wrong, their disaster management is a disaster itself and as a passenger you're usually left with no information about what's going on. Besides that, ground services are pretty slow as well and sometimes you're waiting for more than half an hour at the luggage belt. Seats on the narrowbody fleet are mostly okay while those on the A330s are pretty uncomfortable (didn't try the B777 so far). Turkish Airlines inflight catering is excellent and oustanding compared to most other airlines. When changing planes either at AtatÃ¼rk or Sabiha GÃ¶kcen airport, allow yourself some extra connecting time as flights are often a bit delayed and baggage handling and immigration (for domestic connections) sometimes takes ages. That extra time also increases the chance your luggage will make it on the connecting flight too.

The staff are friendly and polite but some of the 'hip' ways of communicating just don't fit the world of flying.

Air Canada only changed what they had to look at any part of the plane with a touch of detail and you'll see that it's just a gutted plane with very basic changes.

No problems accessing the premium lounge Plenty of drink and food available even though it was a little bit busy. Be prepared to walk a long way to get there and to the gate. However they give you plenty of warning when you are due to board. They scan all passengers in the lounge. You should not be overlooked. Best of all was the smoking lounge where in this politically correct world we live in was a bonus. It is isolated so those of us who wish to smoke can do so in peace.

Air New Zealand,,Mark Svatos,4th August 2013,Los Angeles to Auckland on NZ 1 in 777 (300) economy class. The only way I can describe an airline that insists on having 10 abreast seating on a 777 aircraft is pure greed honestly it just does not work you are so tightly packed and penned in it is just not funny. No matter how many pillows you tuck under and around yourself you just can't get into a comfortable position. As for trying to watch the inflight entertainment my only bit of advise is watch as much of it as you can before the meal service has ended because as soon as that seat reclines in front the screen will be a couple of inches away from your face. On a positive note no real queues for the toilet because so many people are trapped in their seat. I did find the staff excellent especially towards the kids and the food was really quite yummy and enough to keep you full for such a long flight. Do not have too many expectations on the inflight snack service all that was on offer was a packet of chips or a cookie. Next time it will be a lot longer flight and trip but I am sure it will be a much more pleasant trip on Virgin Australia.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,no

Hopefully American learn something from my poor experience and use that to create a better experience for the next guy. On Tuesday 4 October I knew the flight I was originally on for Thursday 6 October was going to get screwed up due to the impending hurricane so I tried to be proactive and call American. I was charged ~$720 to change the flight to Wednesday 5 October. My friend who was also on that same flight, waited until hours later to change his flight. Since a weather alert was issued, he was charged $0 to change his flight. Now you would think that American would be happy that I was proactive and allowed them to be organized, but when I called in and asked for a refund since I thought it was ridiculous that I was charged ~$720 for being proactive, my request naturally was rejected. On Monday 10 October I was booked on flight AA68 leaving at 10:30am. The flight was delayed because there was an oil leak. The original flight was postponed to Tuesday 11 October, however we offered a free transfer to a different flight taking off at 3 pm (4.5 hours later). As a reparation, we were offered food that had already been expired (see picture 1). Finally after boarding the flight, I was given a seat with a defective television screen so I had to stare at a screen with inverted colors while the rest of my flight was able to enjoy a movie. Fortunately, this gave me plenty of time to think about what an awful job American has done on my last 3 flights. American Airlines has just come off of a record year making $7.6 billion dollars. The last two times I've worked with American I gave them roughly $2,000 worth of business. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. Every single flight was delayed, I was fed expired food, I was charged over $700 to change a flight before a natural disaster that you allowed other clients to change for free.

United Airlines,9.0,L Barrallat,12th January 2016,"Pleasantly surprised at how well this Los Angeles to Melbourne flight was, given the length (15 hours) and the reputation of United Airlines. The Boeing 787-9 we flew in was a new aircraft, the cabin does feel airier, with larger windows, and improved lighting. The cabin crew on this flight was a mix bag of very senior flight attendants who were quite stand off-ish, to younger flight attendants who were very nice, attentive and friendly. United has upped its game in catering for the Business First cabin and it shows. Portions were plentiful, wines good, and choices good. The mid-flight snacks left on the credenza at the forward most section of the cabin and in the mid-Business cabin galley were basic and not great, but not an issue, given the large dinner service. Breakfast was served 90 minutes out of Melbourne. Flight departed on time and arrived 30-35 minutes ahead of schedule. If United can replicate the service and feel of the 787-9 to its other aircraft cabins on long haul flights, then it might have turned a corner. The LAX terminal it operates from is dingy, dirty, and has zero to offer in terms of comfort. It is supposed to be upgraded. Not soon enough.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Lim,26th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR.

Qatar Airways,3.0,V Loras,25th December 2013,London to Doha in business on the new Airbus. Our flight attendants English wasn't very good and they were not as efficient as other airlines.

I was lucky as I was traveling with my husband but if I was sleeping that close to a stranger I wouldn't have enjoyed it. With other airlines you can put up a screen which you can't do on this plane. Worst inflight TV selection I've seen on a plane. Old movies and only a few new western release movies. Arrived into Doha for a 6 hour stop over and the Business Lounge is already looking very tired.

Air Canada,10.0,Chris Summers,31st October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | First flight in Business Class with Air Canada from London Heathrow to Montreal. First noted was the ease at T2 and the great service in the Maple Lounge. After take off we were served drinks and snacks that were topped up without waiting for the trolley to come around. Amazing service so far against BA who I normally fly with and Gold member. What is good is the layout of seats, you don't sit facing a random person plus you don't have to climb over anyone to go to the toilet if in a window seat. The tables are great and the cabin crew come and bring a table cloth before they bring the food, another plus better than BA. Appetiser was first class, salmon and salad. Main was a rack of lamb followed by cheese and a selection of ice cream followed by a port. The service is impeccable compared to BA and I think BA is overrated just because of the brand. The plus point is Air Canada is 50% cheaper than BA. So far 3 hours into the flight and cannot fault it. Seats turn into a very comfy spacious bed and again lots of space / storage to put things especially if you wear glasses. Cannot fault Air Canada and it's crew.

United Airlines,1.0,M Samson,3rd January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Port of Spain. If oneâ€™s wondering if customer service has died among the US carriers then any flight with United will confirm that sadly it is deep in the grave. If the insults of charging customers for every single small comfort ever conceived in private transport, werenâ€™t already enough, the totally apathetic or even hostile attitude of the staff in anything but top tier business class, appears to demand that already deceased customers, rise just to be killed again. Passengers flying United are treated no better than cattle, or more properly cash cows to be milked, and then thrown off the plane. In both of our flights the only time the cabin crew even spoke to customers was to reprimand them or tontry and talk them into checking a bag. Heaven forbid they expend a calorie trying to welcome or make customers fee at home. The boarding process for our intâ€™l flight was a keystone cops disaster which could have easily been avoided with simple crowd management measures. Instead they stuffed an entire four groups into two narrow lines - even though they had four and expected people to trample over each other. The solo cranky ticket taker was snapping at customers telling them to â€œgo here, â€œ then no, there!â€ while a security person randomly deleted bags - by eye to get tagged and taken from customers as they entered the plane - no advisory, explanation, apology, nothing. Not a manager was to be seen during all this and our departure was over an hour late. Horrible experience from start to finish.

Flight arrived at 8:35pm and plane took off at 9:08pm. We arrived in Washington 9:55pm or close to that time.

No other flights are leaving out tonight. So I have to sleep in the airport. Catch a morning flight to Atl. The purpose of the email is communications should have been had between 6319 plane and 6322 plane. 6322 never knew of our delays so they proceeded to leave on schedule. I feel like just changing my flight and me sit and sleep over night in an airport is very insensitive. Poor customer service. I fly often and will never fly with United again. I was on a flight once yrs ago and there were a group of people on an international flight.

Even the remark that I travel on First Class did nothing. The lady in the lounge claimed that the United Passes I got from Chase were falsified! They were not as UA customer service later confirmed. The flight itself was a horrible experience: None of very old blue leather seats in First Class reclined. There were no foot-rest (which is standard even in many Economy Classes around the world - for example on Turkish Airlines). The United First Class Seat was at least 30 years old with a sealed armrest ashtray. The food was horrible and cold and a stewardess did not know the difference between white wine and champagne.

Business Class Seat 8A on a new A350 is on my opinion is the best seat on this aircraft, the last row of Business Class, with only one row in front of it, and divider to Premium Economy behind. Lots of space, away from galleys and far enough from lavatories. Two things that are inconvenient - the aircraft is extremely noisy and the noise cancelling headphones, attached to seats in Business Class are very bulky and impossible to sleep in. Ear plugs don't help with the noise. I've done this route three times in the past year, and I always choose 8A on MUC - YVR leg.

Air Canada,3.0,A Victor,30th October 2015,"Unfortunately, I will never fly Air Canada again as long as I can help it. Living in Hawaii requires a long flight to any designation outside the island chain. I have flown Hawaiian mostly to California destinations and have never been sorry about that choice. I always slept comfortably on red eye flights. However, I was in pain and shifting constantly en route to Los Angeles on the first leg of journey because seating was too close. I am only 5'6 and about 125 lbs so it should not be a problem. I couldn't sleep at all. Then, in Los Angeles, as we were boarding a empty plane that was not even close to being sold out, we were stopped by a flight attendant who lifted both our regulation size carry ons. She smugly said, ""if this wasn't a full flight we couldn't let this bag on."" Um, why bother singling us out? Why bother even mentioning it? It was wholly irrelevant. She was just rude. When we got to Toronto, we were in more pain and really uncomfortable because we were on the same aircraft type as the flight across the pacific (two rows of 3 seats, narrow body). The Air Canada folks were really unfriendly and downright couldn't be bothered throughout our traveling. It wasn't isolated. After a 6 hour layover at Toronto, we discovered we weren't seated next to one another on our 10 hour flight to Munich. We tried to get them changed and they were (sort of) but then they messed that up and the double booked our seats. So when we got on the plane we didn't have any seats. The kicker is that I went to ask a question of a flight attendant she pretty much ripped my head off and was extremely confrontational. All I wanted was her to tell the other flight attendant an important piece of info while they were sorting out the seat issue. Our flight to Munich on the brand new airbus was amazing. If you have a chance to fly the dream plane do, but the crew were still unfriendly. When we flew home we flew with Lufthansa and it was great. Back on Air Canada from Vancouver, BC to Hawaii - awful. The flight attendants were dressed in cheap looking uniforms. They left the lights on almost the entire time so we couldn't sleep (night flight) and they kept the air on the entire time. Everyone around us froze. There was no TV, music, or any entertainment at all. They told us we needed to download an app after we were on plane where there is no internet.

American Airlines,9.0,M Ferris,2nd November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I took American Airlines AA109 flight LHR-LAX (Economy) just over a month ago. And let me tell you, it was nice: you left the plane with a great feeling rather than a standard one! While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isnâ€™t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average Iâ€™d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as theyâ€™d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didnâ€™t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didnâ€™t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think itâ€™s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didnâ€™t help so much after all, but thatâ€™s ok. As you can see, American Airlines is not as bad as lots of people say.

Air New Zealand,5.0,B Sparrow,8th November 2013,Having just returned to the US after visiting New Zealand. I wish to comment on the economy seating on B777-300 compared to the B777-200 AKL-LAX. The seats in the new B777-300 are ridiculously cramped both in width and pitch. I had the fortune to buy the emergency seats on both legs but would have struggled if I had been in normal economy on the B777-300. In addition the extra crammed in seat reduces the aisle width to uncomfortable levels for both sitter and walker. Perhaps you should be calling them Hobbit Seats for Hobbit sized people. Even your steward staff were complaining bitterly about the negative feedback they had received from cramped Kiwis. Did Air New Zealand get any focus groups to try these seat mockups for size or did Air New Zealand marketing people get done over by the people who sold the premium seats? Your superb airline staff cannot overcome the 12 hours of cramped misery that that I heard people complain about.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,no

When we boarded the plane, the jet bridge was fairly empty, and we walked onto the plane very quickly. When we got onto the jet, the cabin crew were nice and welcoming. The aisles on the plane were fairly crowded, but it took a short amount of time to get to our seats in the back of the plane. When we sat down, the seat was pretty comfortable. However, the seat cushion moved a little bit, because of the life vest underneath, but it was barely noticeable. The takeoff was pretty smooth, and after a few minutes we were at cruising altitude. The first drink/snack service came out about 1 hour into the flight. After the snack, I turned on the inflight entertainment system. There were a handful of movies to watch on the system and there were games you could play with other passengers on the flight. After the second snack service came out, we were approaching EWR.

Emirates,5.0,H Zharman,15th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Dhaka via Athens and Dubai and back to Newark via same routes. Dreamed about these long haul flights, but got very disappointed - what has happened to Emirates? No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads. Not the best airline for service I have flown with for some time across the oceans. On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines.

At the gate it is announced the flight is delayed, for unknown reasons. The plane is at the gate. Many delay anouncements follow, each stating that boarding is to begin in 20 or 30 minutes. Gate agents canâ€™t provide any information on why we arenâ€™t boarding, I was told they were making an engine repair, another woman was told they were replacing a windshield wiper. After more than 4 hours of being held hostage at the gate, we are finally provided with water. After six hours we are allowed to board. We taxi to the runway and are told we are 3rd in line for take off. Then the pilot announces theyâ€™ve exceeded ground hours and we are returning to the airport. Not a gate, but a small door. United has no gate at VCE, no United employees either. Baggage is delayed for about an hour, another hour in line for hotel voucher, another hour ride to the hotel, finally eat food at 9:30 pm. Back on the bus at 5:30am. Long day, tired, hungry, upset, no explanations. Not a good way to end a nice vacation. United offered no compensation other than the 600 euro as required by law. I would like to know why the flight was delayed, what was wrong with the plane, why so many small delays and no customer service.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Newark,April 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,A Weber,28th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | One of the worst flying experiences. First, my flight took off four hours after schedule and we were stuck in the aircraft. This delay meant a missed connection. There was no one from Turkish Airlines to help or assist. After visiting several counters, waiting for hours, I was given new boarding card for a flight 24 hours later. They did not provide any meal and when I asked for a hotel they made me pay for the visa. The next day they asked me to be ready to go to the airport but they did not come and pick me up. Hotel management contacted the airline and they said I should keep waiting. An hour before the flight time, I decided to take a taxi. Due to a flight delay, I managed to catch my flight.

Alas, on neither my London to Istanbul flight or Istanbul flight did I get it. Not great. Then with a flight leaving at 10.35am - they decide to serve breakfast (about 11.30). Most of us have got up at 6 am to get this flight - what about serving lunch instead? However, this is all minor stuff - what really annoyed me is for the second leg of my return flight (Istanbul to London) they seated me and my partner apart. This is despite the fact that we booked our tickets ages ago! Forgetting common sense, you would have through it pretty basic - wherever possible, seat people who book together, together. It's not rocket science! Despite a call from Addis to Istanbul (which annoyingly cost me over Â£20) to their call centre - there is nothing they can do about this! Question - so if the plane doesn't even do flat seats, and then they don't even seat you together - why fly Turkish Business?",,Business,Business Class,London to Addis Ababa via Istanbul,September 2018,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no

American Airlines,5.0,A Sahni,23rd January 2015,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,3.0,yes

Told us we could not get our luggage. Put us in a hotel in the middle of no where. The KLM ground staff are rude. No one was helpful in any way. The flight staff were lovely. We were stuck in the very back of the plane. Totally cramped it was awful, but the food and staff were good though. On landing in NY we discovered one of our bags was lost. Our cab had to wait for an hour and twenty minutes while we made a lost baggage claim. Again. No help from the ground staff. No KLM staff available in lost baggage office. Got nasty Delta lady who told us it's a KLM problem. We at least got a reference number. So I just called KLM to ask when I could expect my bag. I was asked to ham up and call back as this representative's computer was down. I called back and was eventually told I could expect my back within 8 hours.

When they changed their loyal program earlier this year I kept away from posting anything and waited to see how it would affect me. I am sorry to say that KLM staff on this flight have at best misunderstood the terms and conditions or at worst are purposely misleading customers on the terms and conditions of KLM's new loyalty program. I always upgrade to business class when there are seats available from my economy ticket and more often than not pay full price. On this occasion i paid $900 ontop of my existing ticket to upgrade after confirming with the KLM staff that I would indeed receive the 24XP points in order to retrain my gold status. The flight went well until i noticed that I had only been awarded 8XP points via my KLM app. Upon questioning KLM on this after the flight they informed me that although their system is now revenue based that this ""revenue based"" program do not recognise this type of revenue based spend??

I, along with many of the passengers on this flight, were appalled at the lack of customer service and communication regarding this flight. We boarded and deplaned twice over a 3 hour span due to mechanical problems, first waiting to see if there was another plane available or if the plane could be fixed, until it was declared that the flight was cancelled. Employee at the gate got said ""your flight is cancelled, go to customer service."" No other information was given, no concierge came to speak with us, we were on our own with no other information about where to go, the luggage, departing flight alternatives, procedures, overnight accomodations, nothing. I asked a baggage handler what happened to our luggage, he said it would come off at carousel 9. Carousel 9 was under construction and another baggage personel told us that the bags were going on another flight to West Palm ahead of us. They put a call in to get my luggage and said, go to carousel 8. After another hour and a half later, the bags were still not there.

United Airlines,1.0,S Bair,12th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | My husband and I flew from Newark to Las Vegas. We purchased the tickets a few months before the flight and I was advised to contact United to inform them of my pet allergies. I called 10 days before the flight and was told that there were no animals booked for either direction. I was then told to call back 24 hours prior to the flight as there were a few available seats and the pet policy requires 48 hour prior notification. I called back and was offered a seat in the pet-free area (for $200 more each direction) which I declined as there were no pets booked and we were in the home stretch, the 48 hour notification deadline. I was told to notify the gate agent on arrival. At the airport my bag was pulled for inspection as they x-rayed my book and did a thorough check on my EpiPen. When we finally arrived I let the agent at the gate know about my allergies and was informed that he didnâ€™t know if there were any animals on the flight. He told me that it was policy to book anyone with allergies on the next available flight if there were pets onboard. I asked if the next flight had any pets booked as my husband tried desperately to pull me away from the counter but, not before I heard the agent reply that he didnâ€™t know. He did know that my husband and I would be seated in separate rows, 15 rows difference to be exact. As we boarded, our carry on was removed and banished to the bowels of the plane. I said farewell to my luggage and husband, got seated, cracked my book, and took a deep breath. Thatâ€™s when I began giving my seat mate some serious side-eye to see if she was covered in cat hair as I scratched at my hives and waved away pet fur. I took 2 Benadryl and started hitting the bottle, of eye drops that is. Hour fours, two more Benadryl (thatâ€™s four if youâ€™re counting) and a full bladder. I stood up to use the restroom and peered over the seat directly in front of me and thatâ€™s when I see it. A stressed out, full shed-mode, Pomeranian sitting on his owners lap. He pants as his owner strokes his fur creating the snow globe from hell. Who knew sitting 15 rows away from your husband would come in handy. I passed the baton (bottle of pills and tissues cause heâ€™s allergic to dogs too) and ran to the critter free zone. To be fair, I am an animal lover but, the pet policies have to be addressed. Iâ€™m not the only allergy sufferer and youâ€™ll have a hard time convincing me that this particular dog was a seeing eye dog, a seizure dog, a PTSD pooch or anything but the fluffy family pet.

Too much failure on American Airlines end when it comes to customer service and inspiring information for delayed baggage. Overall this is the 2nd terrible experience with this airline.

We ended up in a long queue and were at the counter shortly before midnight, only to be told that the next available flight is 2 days from now. We politely declined and asked them to organise a hotel. They said there's nobody to do it and we should do it ourselves and expense the money back. Now finding a hotel in the middle of the night in Boston can be a real adventure. We managed to do it and were as conscious of cost as possible. In the end Air Canada only wanted to reimburse us a 100$ total for the hotel stay. We paid way more. Although they didn't care about what happened to us they didn't even want to cover basic costs. It's now over 4 weeks and we haven't seen a penny. The ticket cost were supposed to get charged back to my card end of June. Nothing has arrived yet. The same happened with a Delta flight and I got my money back within a week. In summary a total disappointment.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Toronto,July 2018,2.0,5.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

The flight was diverted to Rochester N.Y where it sat for 8 hours. A JB agent in Rochester changed his connecting flight to Portland without checking to see if his connecting flight was on time (in fact it too was delayed). When he finally arrived at JFK at 11.30am he found that the new connecting flight on which he was re-routed had been cancelled. His original connecting flight however was the scheduled to depart JFK at 2.30 am. Ultimately his original connecting flight was also cancelled. The JB customer assistance desk was completely vacant and there were hour-long waits on the phone. A single gate agent was attempting to assist and her line was 100 feet long. When he reached her she said his only option was a flight leaving at 10.30 pm on July 3. He finally obtained a seat on a flight to Boston departing at 11 am. Eight hours later he walked past a gate at JFK that showed a flight to Portland at 1.30 pm which was never mentioned by the gate agent the previous night. He managed to get on the flight.

This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome. If you have not flown Inter-Europe flights, most airlines do not have a separate business class configuration. They use coach seats and then do not book the middle seat. The service is upgraded in these seats, but you are basically being wedged into coach seats at a business class price.

I was supposed to make an international flight from Chattanooga to Hamburg with two layovers in Newark, NJ and Copenhagen. Well the United flight from Chattanooga to Newark was cancelled due to â€œair traffic problemsâ€. There was never any notification of the cancellation and everyone had to find out at check in. Since I was supposed to be making an international flight, they quickly rebooked me to fly to Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Hamburg. The flight from Chattanooga to Chicago was decent. I had a 4 hour layover in Chicago waiting to board my international flight to Frankfurt. As I was boarding the employees pulled me aside and told me my boarding pass wasnâ€™t valid. They said I was booked going to Stockholm in the computer system. So they didnâ€™t let me board the plane until they could figure out whatâ€™s going on. Then the plane closed the door and took off without me because they couldnâ€™t sort out my ticket situation. So whoever rebooked my ticket, did something completely wrong - gave me a boarding pass that wasnâ€™t actually valid, and I missed an overnight international flight. Since the error was 110% due to Unitedâ€™s employees lacking the simple skills to print a valid ticket, I was at least given a hotel room for the night.

United Airlines,1.0,David Norton,27th October 2016,"Chicago to La Guardia and another zero star effort from United Airlines. I volunteered to give up my seat on an overbooked aircraft. There was no one at the gate so I went to United customer service. This must have been the first time the idle group of 15 workers have ever heard of an overbooked flight as they could not process (cognitively) what I was offering. After a few minutes, they referred me back to the idle gate (which we could see no one was there). Realizing that this was idiotic, I walked to one of the other NYC bound flight gates as we have 3 major airports in the US's busiest city. The good news was that there was a half empty flight leaving in 30 minutes! The bad news was that United said it would be too difficult to swap with such short notice. Despite being 8 feet from the jetway and presented with a situation which was both beneficial for myself and United, this was yet another insurmountable task. The lady was kind enough to tell me that my overbooked flight (which I have a ticket for) is going to be 2 hours late though. I fly for work every week. I have to take the cheapest airline as a company policy. Why can American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and even Frontier figure it out, yet 100% of the time, United has excuses and animosity towards its customers? I feel bad throwing United employees under the bus because the only real difference between them and the other airlines workers is a lack of training.

Lufthansa,8.0,Gustafsson Magnus,6th July 2014,I travelled with Lufthansa from Stockholm Arlanda Sweden to Frankfurt Germany on June 23. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time.

The London to Dubai and Dubai to London were on a 777-300ER the DXB to HKG on an A380. What a difference. The A380 was comfort personified. You are cocooned in your little area with nobody beside or immediately in front of you - I was in seat 23K. You have plenty of space with easy access out to the aisle. The 777 however felt very cramped with somebody sitting next to you. When that passenger has his seat in bed mode you have to clamber over his legs to get out to the aisle. With the A380 you have plenty of storage space with the deep side compartments. On the 777 there is no place to store anything other than the overhead locker. Up until experiencing the A380/777 difference I have never much cared about the airplane I am sitting on - from now on for me it just has to be the A380.

However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Anders Pedersen,18th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha on 15-16 June 2017 on B787 and A330 respectively. Flights were on time and service was good. Doha airport deserted due to the ongoing blockage and due to Ramadan. QR tackles the crises well by preponing some of the connecting flights from Doha to avoid delays due to excessive lengths of routings avoiding unfriendly airspace. Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game. Onboard, lengthy safety video shown with Barcelona FC become boring after being unchanged for several years. I am puzzled by the intrusive charity propaganda and money collection attempt by introducing ""Educate a Child"" propaganda without providing any facts and prove of efficiency. Children well cared for and given gifts and child meal given if requested prior to travel. Luggage handled well and all 4 pieces arrived to perfection at final destination.",Boeing 787-8 / A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha,June 2017,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Qatar Airways,8.0,W Harsha,24th September 2013,LHR-DXB return via DOH. First leg on A330 - seat and entertainment fine. I hold privilege club gold status and was greeted onboard by crew. Meal choices outlined were inconsistent with what was actually served. Overnight flight which departed one hour late - cabin lights dimmed after dinner service but fully illuminated three hours before landing when they served a snack (which was appalling). Missed connecting flight in Doha but was already booked onto the next flight and had to wait only 90 mins. Second leg on a new A321 with touchscreen entertainment. Crew were polite and efficient. Snack served on this 40minute flight consisted of a savoury and sweet breakfast - which was horrible. A microwaved sandwich and a muffin. Return DXB-DOH again new A321 crew once again polite efficient and friendly. Awful snack once more. DOH-LHR leg was disappointing. The flight was full and on a A330 which was clearly showing its age. Old style IFE - with controller inbuilt into the armrest - which makes it very awkward to operate. Crew were clearly over stretched and somewhat inexperienced forgetting requests and serving wrong meals. I will continue to fly QR but the decline in catering is a concern. Also I have noticed that some crew lack the hospitality which has made QR deserve its 5* status. I remain committed to flying QR whenever possible and will continue to recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
Qatar Airways,10.0,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,30th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to Milan via Doha, returning from Rome. Check in was a breeze, and I waited only 5 minutes. I was greeted by the cabin senior, who was polite and welcoming. This flight was about 85% full. I was seated where the second cabin senior with 12 years' experience was in charge of, he was polite and observant. He noticed my mother sitting in the middle seat squeezed in and very uncomfortable, and he said he will move her to a more comfortable spot once the service ends. Food on board this flight was sub par. The 777's seats are tight, and overhead bins get filled up very quickly. Transfer in Doha was really tight, with no time to spare. The next flight to Milan was an A330. I prefer 2-4-2 configuration more than 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration, as couples can sit together. On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional. On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok. Boeing 787 roomy atmosphere on board all added to a great flight. The seats are very comfortable and felt like an armchair in full recline. The crew on this flight were fantastic. After breakfast service, I went to talk to the cabin senior in the galley, and he had some spare business class meals, and he obliged me to try them, and he also gave me some snacks, which was everything an avgeek could ask for. Before landing, he asked me if wanted to try the business class seats. On the flight to Bangkok, it was another 777, and the crew were still excellent.

American Airlines,2.0,C Shiels,28th April 2014,I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Christelle Nasrany,24th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight. This flight and this airport is never to be recommended.",A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Beirut,November 2018,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air New Zealand,9.0,Francis Wong,21st October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Wellington to Sydney. They have very good flight time at 10:15 am which arrives at noon in Sydney. The best part is what they called Work Deluxe, which is more like a premium economy on other airlines. The small single-aisled air craft has 3x3 seating and no business class. Work + Bag and Work deluxe is almost like their ""Business class"", with the front 3 rows of seats used for that, with a middle seat blocked (guaranteed) to create a bit more space between passengers. For work deluxe they give bottled water, noise canceling headphone, landing form with free pen, a free meal, free drinks including alcohol. Priority baggage and brooding too. I find the whole thing even better than I had expected, the service was great too! I had a problem with self check-in, the staffs at the airport were very helpful and courteous. One would have to pay premium price , easily 3 times more that what I had paid, to get that on their competitors like Qantas, which only uses a small 737, but they do have a business class installed.

Had a really enjoyable service and even with a 45 minute weather delay due to incoming aircraft off the east coast still arrived in O'Hare relatively punctual. Outbound aircraft was the 737-900 with Boeing Sky Interior - which is very calming for a 4.5 hour flight. The only drawback was it was so new that the IFE hadn't been installed yet (not a deal-breaker as I normally read/work). Return aircraft 757-200 International config with on-demand. The best part of the trip were the crew. Both directions they were attentive and intuitive. They learned my drink order upon getting settled in and never had to ask again (with repeated re-fills).

On the flight QR564 from Doha to Delhi on 19 March I had very severe earache and I must say that the chief steward really went the extra mile providing me with a hot honey and lemon drink - mush appreciated and really unexpected for an economy class passenger! However the boarding at Delhi on 8th March was a terrible experience - standing in 5 queues for an hour and a half at dawn is not funny especially for a senior citizen. Also there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight from Doha to Nairobi nor on the one from Dar es Salaam to Doha.

We showed that gear to the Emirates check-in manager in New York, who gave us no trouble at all for carrying it on as hand luggage. Leaving Johannesburg, Emirates agents stopped us and the manager treated us terribly, telling us that we couldn't take the gear on the plane, that it was a safety hazard, blah blah. Our checked luggage was very light so we were not over in terms of the weight we were bringing on the flight. He told us that our only option was to sign a liability form and put the lenses in the hold. We might as well have thrown the gear into the street and watched the trucks run over it. This was the day before Christmas, and the airline basically threw us out to find our own way home at holiday time -- even though they had allowed us to fly in. We got no refund.

I have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. I stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers.

Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1.0,Y Delniz,21st February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Moscow. Overall, the inflight experience is OK, but nothing special. However the airline is terribly overpriced. The cheapest option you will find for Amsterdam to Moscow is at least â‚¬300. There are no other airlines flying this route without stop. It surprises me to see this airline, selling tickets from Amsterdam to Shanghai from just â‚¬350, but Amsterda to Moscow from â‚¬300. Note, that Amsterdam-Moscow is just a continental European, 3 hour flight with no onboard entertainment or anything special. KLM flies the same route charging the same prices. Now, I am flying monthly to Moscow, but not anymore from Amsterdam, but from Brussels, as it saves â‚¬100 per flight. I am strongly considering to fly with a layover in Riga from now on. Despite being an Aeroflot bonus member, and taking 23 flights last year, I have never been upgraded to anything, and never been recognised as a customer. On the contrary, when I had to change my plane tickets because of making a mistake with the dates (I contacted them within 1 hour after booking and went to the office within 2 hours after booking), they insisted that I had to pay, despite other airlines who change it for free within a reasonable timeframe.

The plane was a 767-300 and the seat was very uncomfortable as the padding in the middle of the seat had vanished over the years. The four stewardesses in my area must have been 60ish and not up to speed. One stewardess asked a passenger to get out of his seat and close the overhead bin as she had a bad back. Knowing that Air Canada did not serve meals domestically I checked online about international flights and it said that meals were served. None provided. During the flight I was offered a decent beverage twice and a couple of times the stewardess came by with a tacky plastic jug and served lukewarm water.

I am now waiting to find out even if we can fly at 9.20am or not. Which can't be answered until 8.50am. This is an unacceptable way to treat customers and I am sure is ruining more than the start of my vacation.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,D Rayhada,20th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Jakarta to Sao Paulo return via Istanbul with Boeing 777-300ER in Business Class. I felt that the entertainment screen is quite small, it is adequate but would be great if we could enjoy larger screen size. Food options were satisfying and presentation was nice thanks to Do&Co catering. It would be great if they offer flexibility to their pax to be able to opt to dine whenever they wish (not only in a designated meal service time). This is particularly for the red-eye flight like Sao Paulo-Istanbul which depart at 3am and a meal was served just after take off. Cabin crew polite and courteous especially Indonesian-bound flight. Lounge at Istanbul was great with many food selections but much fewer when you departing late at night. One most point that need to be improved is the boarding arrangement at the Departure Gate especially for Business Class Passengers !

Aeromexico,4.0,Andrei Olivares,18th November 2015,"The main issue with AeromÃ©xico is that the common practice of overselling the flight is more than common, is a routine especially in flight inside Mexico, so you can't take for granted anything even if you check in before. But the last flight was just unbelievable. I made my reservation for my wife (pregnant), my little girl and myself, when we arrived to the airport they intend to give boarding passes only for my wife and kid and not me - splitting my family even though we were in the same reservation. No way I will take the risk of not flying with my family just because AeromÃ©xico have sell more tickets than seats. At the end I had an awful time dealing with a guy without criteria, they only say it is a common practice. When you take these other factors in consideration : the MX City airport is over capacity, the delay of flights now is a guarantee, they oversell the flights and they are selling more flights so the situation is a mess and the least importance is the passenger. It is a business made in expenses of thousands of passengers waiting forever in the airports without guarantees of a ticket they already bought.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,7.0,Haglund Fredrik,19th April 2015,ARN-SVO-BKK return on new A320 and B773. Flights more or less on time. No problem with transfer. Good in-flight entertainment on B773. Food in economy just OK. We got an upgrade to Comfort class on BKK-SVO which was great. Big seats and plenty of leg room. Food also better - but not sure if better because of Comfort class or because made in Thailand. I don't like Aeroflots bread buns wrapped in plastic. They ought to have fresh bread. I also think all passengers on all long haul flights ought to be given 05 litres of water in bottles. Only difference to other European 3 and 4 star carriers appears to be the no alcohol policy.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,M Hogan,6th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bahrain to Cardiff via Amsterdam. As customers we have to except that cancellations do happen & that more often than not the decision to cancel is taken with our safety in mind. Every airline can run well under normal circumstances but a good test of a airline is to see how they cope with situations like these. KLM were aware of bad weather & by the time my flight had arrived had already cancelled a lot of flights, with this in mind you would of thought that a large business would ensure that they have enough staff on hand not only in the airport but also online & on the end of the phone to cope with the very predictable customer demand that would inevitably ensue. Not the case with KLM. Arrived in Amsterdam to a flight board of mostly delayed or cancelled flights, then had to virtually beg to get into the Crown Lounge with a Petroleum card despite being fully entitled to enter, I was later told that KLM staff were trying to reduce the amount of people in the lounge due to the cancellations. What is the point of issuing loyal customers with a privilege card if you are not prepared to give them the privilege in the first place? Upon being emailed & texted that my flight was cancelled I was given a link to click to re-arrange my flight, brilliant I thought, not brilliant as the link took me to a blank page. Not a problem I will go to the customer service desk & sort this. I (together with a lot of other people) had to wait for over 1hr and 30mins just to be seen, by which time all other seats were taken & waiting lists were at least ten deep for that days remaining flights. Not a problem, as I (& many others) hold a privilege card this takes my to the front of the ""waiting list"" for last minute seats, this is one of the major selling point of the privilege card system. But apparently when you most need this service KLM are not ready to honour it, leaving you as a loyal customer with no extra benefits that KLM had previously promised you in order to get your business & loyalty in the first place. 3 hours later I managed to re-book my flight, 5 hours later I managed to get to the hotel, to be far after this everything seems to be running ok. However, when you compare this airline to how other airlines cope with disruption KLM falls well short of just achieving basic organisation let alone good customer service. When you have your flight cancelled with KLM you will receive a voucher for 15 euros off inflight duty free which was not valid on my flight as my flight is under 70 minutes in duration. Or 2000 air miles credited to your account but only after you learn to read Dutch to decipher the voucher you have been given & then post in all your boarding passes & receipts to a international address, which will probably cost you the same in postage as the miles are worth. This is after you have tried to re-book your flight using one of the three online services they advertise, non of them worked & no response was received from any for over 12 hours. So in all likely hood you will have a 1 hour 30 minute wait to see a (understandably) fed up customer service rep.",,Business,Business Class,Bahrain to Cardiff via Amsterdam,October 2017,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,C Geurts,18th February 2015,From the moment we tried to check in at the Spokane Airport until our return from Costa Rica a week later we felt like we were just a major inconvenience to the entire Airline. At check in the staff member rolled her eyes while informing us we were in the wrong line and it went downhill from there. No smiles no greetings no nothing - flight crew were grumpy and detached. When I asked what was on their food menu for purchase another roll of the eyes and was informed it was in the book in front of me. Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load. We were pried into our seats with a shoe horn and never in all my travels have I felt so claustrophobic - the 3 hour leg of the trip was almost unbearable to sit through. No leg room small seating and the person ahead of me nearly had his head in my lap when reclining.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Jim Ameson,27th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew a total of 4 Turkish Airlines flights on my recent trip to Europe, from New York to Paris CDG via Istanbul, returning from Frankfurt to New York via Istanbul. The cabin crew were warm and friendly, food was quite good for aircraft food, especially if you are a fan of Turkish food. Expect a small salad, a yogurt/tsatziki sauce, choice between a chicken dish and a beef dish, with the lighter meal consisting of a pasta dish. There's warm bread and I've eaten more hummus on those four flights than I have in my life. The new A330s have a great entertainment system, with a nice multi-touch display, live TV, and wi-fi (purchase necessary). The slightly older A330 going from IST to CDG also had an older touchscreen display but was a bit unresponsive to input. The actual movies and TV shows were the same regardless of the hardware and so it was easy to overlook the hardware troubles. There is decent legroom although you start to feel a little claustrophobic once the person in front of you reclines back.

American Airlines,1.0,Rich Pagliaro,3rd June 2016,"Back in January, I booked a direct flight from JAX (Jacksonville, FL) to ORD (O'Hare-Chicago, IL) through Expedia. My family and I were returning home from my niece's graduation and my son had school the following day. The flight number was 4266 and it was scheduled to leave JAX at 5.20pm and arrive at ORD at 7.09pm. About a month later Expedia called and stated that American had dropped that flight and we would need to reschedule. The only available flights that would get us home at a decent hour was to go from JAX to CLT (Charlotte, NC) at 4.54pm-6.15pm and then CLT to ORD at 7.05-9.14pm. Certainly not what I wanted, but better than nothing. This was all for a flight on May 23rd, 2016. We arrived at the airport about 2.30pm and proceeded to our gate. So much for the long security line. Sometime after that, we received an alert from Expedia that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. About 5 minutes later, Expedia alerted us that our flight was now an hour late. Still nothing from American even though they had my email, phone number and I had the American Airline app on my phone all setup for alerts. About 5 minutes after the second Expedia alert American finally sent an alert via phone call that our flight was 30 minutes late. That was the only notice we received from American outside of the announcements at the gate that did not start until later. I knew we would miss our connecting flight so I went to the gate to inquire about a later flight from CLT to ORD. I was informed that they automatically pushed us back to the 10.35 flight from CLT to ORD. Nice to have a seat but where was the notification? Not to mention that the flight was not schedule to land at ORD until 11.44pm. A little late for my son to be out on a school night. I was also told by the person working the gate that my original direct flight was being put back on the schedule in June. Very nice of her to point that out, especially when it didn't help me at the time. Or maybe I could have just stayed at the airport another few weeks. Our flight out of JAX ended up 2 1/2 hours late giving us enough time to get to the gate in CLT with about 15 minutes to spare. Thank goodness we had carry-ons only. Our flight to ORD was slightly delayed but not too bad. The flight attendant forgot to offer my wife and I our complimentary beverage during service. I had to ask her for a drink and she seemed put off that I did so. I called customer service to complain as I had paid a premium originally for a direct flight, was bumped to a cheaper flight and was now bumped again to an even cheaper flight. They said they could not help me and I needed to send an email to customer relations. So I did explaining exactly what happened and how I was now also going to need to spend money on a meal at the airport that I did not plan to do. And we all know those are not cheap. American Airlines response to me was that services were provided. I will never fly American again and will never recommend them.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,JAX to ORD via CLT,2016-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,3.0,R Breakwell,25th December 2013,NBO-SIN-NBO. First leg was alright but nothing great. Food service was slow and FA didn't clear trays for ages. Second leg to Singapore on A380 was much anticipated but disappointing seat configuration thus narrow seats thus alot of discomfort. SIN-DXB was much better but had to keep asking for water/drinks. Don't know why they just don't offer bottles of water like in business class. Flying from Singapore to Perth on Qantas we were given bottles of water to rehydrate - great for a 5 hours flight and essential for a 10+ hour flight which Emirates should consider. Last flight was the worst - lots of turbulence so we didn't get any meals. Not Emirates fault but the crew were very unprofessional. Very thirsty flight again as not enough water/drinks provided. Granted we had to remain seated during the turbulence but one cup of water and 1 juice is not enough for a 5 hour flight. Cabin crew on all sectors were not very helpful and not very friendly. Same could be said of counter staff at the business class lounge. We've been flying Emirates for 10 years and except for the last couple of years due to a change in our country of abode and travel patterns have had to use other airlines so have slipped down to Skywards silver status. We were planning to use Emirates more for our 2014 flights but will now consider other airlines. The only saving grace is the ICE entertainment system which helps you forget the lack of water/drinks the bland food and that tray in front of you.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,,3.0,no

Moscow - Istanbul was on a 5-year old Boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. Everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. The seats were unbelievably, and I mean it, unbelievably tight. It was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. The fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. I lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but I seriously doubt it I would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. The cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. They never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. I have never experienced anything like this, I felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. The meal service was alright. I ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on Aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. Nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. There was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of Eastern Europe"". I must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - Turkish Airlines and Atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. There was no entertainment onboard. You could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. The landing in Istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. The passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. So, once again, major safety hazard. Istanbul-Moscow was another story. It was Boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. Their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. I still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. The seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. I wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. Cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. No wine or beer once again. The kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology. Overall, Aeroflot left a poor impression, and I will make sure to avoid it.",Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Istanbul,August 2018,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,1.0,K Gyoun,26th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Gdansk to London via Munich. When I purchased the ticket, there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at Munich / Frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so I chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. If Lufthansa sells the tickets, the transfer should be possible. In fact, I had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. When my first flight arrived in Munich, I had to run. But there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. There was a hotel at the airport, Lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. They should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time. I tried to complain to Lufthansa, however, their website didn't allow me to do so. So I emailed their customer service. They acknowledged the receipt but I haven't heard from them since then.

Alitalia,1.0,Giovanna Pomilio,24th October 2015,I had the worst customer service experience ever. Beware of Alitalia online booking because they hide lots of onerous conditions in some small print behind the main screen. I accidentally confirmed a london-milan return flight and realised the wrong departure date. I called the customer service immediately and they ignored it saying it was my fault to chose a tariff that does not allow changes and morover if you do not use one leg the other leg becomes void. None of these conditions were clearly spelled out but of course are scripted somewhere to give them legal safety. I lost Â£250 they just put the phone down on me. I tried then to call the Italian call centre and to add to the mistreatment they said that if I would have made the tickets via the Italian website they could have helped - but unfortunately I did in the uk website.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,R Caws,23rd June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Extremely unhappy with Delta. I had a so-so experience during a flight to Little Rock on a Delta partner a few years ago. This time around we flew into DCA. Upon departing D.C., we were delayed by inclement weather to a connection in Atlanta. Even though we selected an alternative flight upon self check-in, we received passes for the cancelled flight. Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning. On other notes, Delta doesn't offer a free checked bag like many airlines. To check one bag is $25. The food on the flight to LAX was overpriced generic junk, think $12 for a wrap you could have bought for $5 at 7-11.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DCA to LAX,June 2016,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

My husband and I were not seated together I was in row 28 and he was in row 38 with 2 gentlemen of about 7 ft tall. They were father and son basketball players the son with ASU. My husband was bruised on his foot by the lack of room in the seats. The bathrooms were locked for the first hour while the inept crew attended a woman with a seizure probably due to the excessive heat in the cabin. Another woman threw up and there was no cart service for the first half of the trip. When I spoke to the crew about the heat that was so bad most people were spillled over into the aisle as the seats were suffocating. I was told to turn on my air vent which was fully open. Duh! We were instructed to only use the bathroom in our assigned cabin, once they were finally open. The access to the bathroom was obstructed by the stretched out legs of the 7 ft man who should never been moved to the last row where the seat room is mallet due to airline design and lack of reclining seats although the row in front reclines into thenpassengers face",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Phoenix,July 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,8.0,B Robinson,23rd March 2015,"Due to a booking snafu (which may have been of my making) and the flight being oversold our non-stop return flight LHR-RDU was unavailable. The courteous and helpful ticket desk staff re-booked our free ticket LHR-JFK-RDU. We were told with great pride that the transatlantic portion would be aboard AA's new flagship 777-300ER. I applaud AA as being the only U.S. airline to give it's customers the opportunity to ride the latest and finest of American ingenuity technology and manufacturing excellence. It did strike me however that AA may have commissioned a ""lite"" version of the plane as it was missing some of the bells and whistles I had seen on some foreign carriers (wood floors mood lighting etc). Overall the economy interior can best be described as bland. On the plus side mammoth overhead bins decent seats great ride and as good an in flight entertainment system as you'll find anywhere in coach. Watched three excellent first run movies. All we need now is some edible food and AA will have caught up with BA and VS. However as a word of caution to those flying from the US to the UK on AA be aware of the aircraft type when you make your booking. In addition to the new AA Flagship 777-300 the airline also flies the 777-200 which is getting along in age the venerable 767-300 and the 757-200 which in my opinion is not at all suited to Transatlantic travel.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

When I booked the flight it was nowhere mentioned that we would stop in Kuala Lumpur, as happened when I booked the flight from Amsterdam to Denpasar, that included a stopover in Singapore. That is not honest for such a â€œseriousâ€ airline. Therefore, in both flights we â€œlostâ€œ around one hour and a half because of those stopovers. Besides, KLMâ€™s system seems to be that of a third class airline since I was never able to change seats even though the system was inviting and â€œallowingâ€ me to do it. Food in the Jakarta- Kuala Lumpur leg was indeed awful and in the rest of the trip was just bearable. After boarding the plane for the leg Amsterdam - Atlanta we observed something that was â€œstrangeâ€: the cabin crew in the back part of the plane did not show any interest in helping passengers solve their seat and hand luggage problems. The two crew ladies were very happy chatting aloud between themselves and showed no concern for the passengers. Poor service! We hadâ€™nt flown with KLM since a long time ago.

Air New Zealand,7.0,P Norton,4th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Light and shadow on this Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Melbourne. The outbound trip was on a B77W, the inbound trip on an A320. Like many airlines today, Air New Zealand offers different fare options where you either have only carry-on luggage, a checked bag or checked-bag, meals and movies. I chose the basic option without even a checked bag. You still get a decent amount of free water, tea and coffee on the flight and can make use of the non-movie part of the IFE, in particular their great music selection. One further downside of the two most basic fare options is that Air NZ requires you to pay for choosing your seat even at check-in, which gives the experience a low-cost feel. If you do not pay, the system chooses a seat for you. The seat pitch on the B777 was decent, the pitch on the A320 very tight for a 3 1/2 hours flight. At least, I was lucky that I had an aisle seat on the latter flight. One element that was consistently excellent throughout the two flights was the service of the cabin crew.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Auckland to Melbourne,October 2017,2.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes

Air New Zealand,6.0,Gersten Zvia,9th March 2015,2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would co-op with these extra hours had it not be for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. The disrespect and disregard to it's passengers is shameful. There is no room for peoples' legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples' health as well. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants were beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots are tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. People stared in disbelief. However when we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs.

American Airlines,1.0,Lori Edelman,22nd May 2016,"Saint Martin to Philadelphia with American Airlines. I am 27 years old and my mother is 62. In all our years of travel neither of us had ever experienced anything like our flight out of Saint Martin yesterday. We booked a direct flight that left at 2:40PM and was to land in Philadelphia at 7:13PM. When we boarded the plane we were told we would arrive in Philadelphia early and were very pleased by this news. However, after a short time the pilot told us that there was something wrong with the plane. ""Something"" with no further detail as to what was wrong or how long it would take to repair. After 2 hours of waiting in the plane, we were told that the plane was repaired and would be able to fly. The pilot informed us however that due to ""legal issues"" we would not be able to fly to Philadelphia as planned, which was an estimated 4 hours and 35 minutes, instead we would be flying to Miami a 3 hour and 15 minute flight. We were not told anything other than that. We were then given the option to leave the plane but were told we would not be provided a room. About 40 minutes later we took off for Miami. We landed in Miami and waited on the tarmac for over an hour. Were told that we would be greeted by individuals who would tell us where to go and would take us step by step through customs and our return to the 10:30 flight from Miami to PHL. There was no one there to greet us when we arrived and no one to direct us through customs and security. We went through customs and were required to go through TSA security, despite not leaving the airport or having time to purchase anything. Once we arrived at our flight we were delayed in boarding and did not take off until after 11:30. We arrived in Philadelphia at around 2:00 and there was no one from AA to greet us or speak to. We waited, as a group, for our luggage for over 45 minutes before it began to come out. I am extremely disappointed with how disorganized and unapologetic this airline was.

Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position.

I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates.

The plane was very old, the entertainment system didnâ€™t work, had to be reset for the entire plan, and still went out halfway through the flight. Clearly the crew were aware that it was a recurring problem. If you know your entertainment system is not working, you should disclose it in advance. Also, 8,000 points is not adequate compensation for it not working. If you listed a seat for sale and disclosed the fact that the entertainment system didn't work, you would have to offer more than an 8,000 point discount for someone to purchase it vs. a working seat.

Qatar Airways,10.0,Elton Chapman,21st January 2015,Outbound LHR-DOH-MEL return MEL-DOH-MAN. 3rd time flying Qatar business class. The Qatar lounge at LHR is incredible. Modern well designed comfortable with great staff and fantastic food and drinks on offer. We had a full breakfast with a couple of glasses of champagne and it was a great way to start our vacation. Our first flight from LHR was on the three class A340-600 and I was impressed. This was our first time on this aircraft type with Qatar and I was surprised how spacious it was. The angled lie flat seat was comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep. The galley is at the rear of business class so the front seats get served last. We had a couple of hours to kill in Doha before our next flight to Melbourne. This was our first time at the new Hamad airport. It was great not to have to do the long bus tour of the airport as you did at the old terminal. The business class lounge is really badly sign-posted but we found it eventually. The lounge was impressive but I think I was expecting more. Table service drinks throughout the lounge apart from one proper bar which is located upstairs. Return flights to Melbourne were on the 2 class 777. The space in business is incredible and the lie flat seats are comfortable. First time we've been given the mattresses which you now get with the usual PJs and slippers but only on night flights. I thought the mattress was a nice touch and added to the overall comfort. Our return flight from Melbourne used the Qantas business lounge which was really poor. Uncomfortable and a very poor selection of food and drink. I was glad to get out of there. Our Melbourne departure was delayed by 45 minutes and we only had a 65 minute transfer time at Doha. From my experience great customer service comes into play when things go wrong (like flight delays) and Qatar handled things superbly. We were met as we left the aircraft with details of our transfer gate and the aircraft was held on stand for us until we arrived. Our luggage was fast tracked and I was amazed to see it on the carousel at Manchester airport. The flight to Manchester was on the smaller A330.200 but again a great aircraft (slightly older) with an angled lie flat seat. Food and beverage on all flights was to a really good standard. But what really makes Qatar stand out though is the consistently high standard of service in business class. I was really impressed with this on all our flights and their five star status really is deserved.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
American Airlines,1.0,Stephanie Spoto,28th August 2016,"I guess I should start off by saying that this is the first negative review Iâ€™ve ever written. Iâ€™m normally not one to bash people on the grounds that I like to think the intention is always there, but there is no getting around my last experience with American Airlines. Okay..where do I start. My friends and I are flying from Managua, Nicaragua to Rochester, NY with connecting flights from Managua to Miami, Miami to Charlotte, Charlotte to ROC. Everything is going smoothly up until there is a 30 minute (which turns into an unannounced 50 minute) delay on the Miami to Charlotte flightâ€¦which is fine. Delays happen, I get it. However, noticing that we would probably be cutting it close to our next flight, my friend goes to ask if there were other flights we could look into it if we didn't catch it. She starts by saying that we have a connecting flight - until he cuts her off and says â€œ-yeah, you and everyone else.â€ That was the end of the conversation. I also am not naive to the fact that when people are under stress they can come off as rude, but why work in customer service if you cant handle people? So wheels are down at 10:10 PM in Charlotte and our next flight departs at 10:20 PM - when we get there itâ€™s gone. They couldâ€™ve waited 5 minutes if they knew that was the last flight out! Anyway, so we get up to the front desk after an hour wait in customer service and although the lady is very sweet, she has no idea what she's doing. It takes about 40 minutes for her to get us a hotel and book us flight the next day from Charlotte to Chicago, Chicago to ROC. We notice the next morning that there was a direct flight to Buffalo available that we said weâ€™d be willing to fly into, but she didn't even inform us about it. So after we fly into Chicago, we get to the gate just in time to check in - only to find out that weâ€™re not even confirmed for the flight!! The man is rude and not helpful at all",,,,,,,,,,,,

For those of you who do not know, when you check-in you are assigned a zone and a number. This is the order by which you board and from there it's general admission. Maybe that sounds fine until you travel with your wife and kid and realize that you will be forced to rely on the general good will of the 160 people who have boarded the plane ahead of you in order to sit with your family. We were not so fortunate. Even when the entire plane of passengers was bribed with free drinks for the flight, there were still no takers.

Emirates,7.0,Jelle Bosma,4th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | The basics are good and we had a good experience with Emirates from Bangkok to DÃ¼sseldorf via Dubai. Especially the newest A380's are very comfortable because the better seats and bigger IFE screens. On our outbound journy we had upper deck seats which are very nice and I do recommend to try to get a seat up there. The older A380's were a bit less comfortable and nice. The difference between the new and old(er) cabin is big, that's a shame. Food is good, sometimes we had to ask for a drink because the cabin crew wasn't walking around that frequently. The food, seat comfort and IFE was good. We experienced some things that annoyed us a little bit. The most important is the delays due to chaotic boarding processes. There was not enough dicipline to succeed the zone boarding system. Plus, the bad communication between staff and customers. Customer service told us it was no problem to link our luggage to Dubai only, and not to DÃ¼sseldorf as we planned a long layover to see Dubai. At Bangkok, the check-in agent told us if we wanted to have our luggage checked to Dubai, we had to pay an additional fee of 6800 baht each. Overall: I would recommend flying with Emirates because the comfort.

When I woke up I dined (on demand) on good quality Japanese and Western food, and then rested for the rest of this 12 hour sector. Transfer at DOH was slightly less chaotic than outbound, but it is noticeable that the volume of transfer pax has not been well planned for and security is somewhat lax to get pax through quickly. Signage in DOH is poor, and I struggled to find my way to the Business lounge. Boarding the A380 was a treat (my first time) - we were warmly welcomed by a charming FA who took our coats and offered us a drink. I cannot believe how quiet the A380 is, especially on take-off.

I was offered wheelchair assistance at DTW (Michigan) airport where I boarded the flight and my daughter went home relieved that I would be provided wheelchair assistance for the rest of my itinerary. However, I was left in the lurch when I arrived in Boston airport to board flight to Bangalore via Dubai. I had very little time left to board the flight and had to push myself to walk fast with the unbearable pain. This continued in Dubai airport as once again there was no wheelchair assistance provided in Dubai. I somehow managed this time as I had two hours twenty minutes to board the next flight. This left me wondering why I was promised wheelchair assistance if the airline was not able to provide the promised service. I was totally disappointed as to how a passenger could be left unattended to by a reputed airline in spite of the request for wheelchair assistance/help.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Bengaluru via Dubai,February 2018,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,10.0,Michael Dielissen,31st March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Miami via Atlanta. I am pleased with the value for money I get with Delta airlines in first. Check-in at YYZ was quick and friendly and our luggage was tagged priority. YYZ does not have a lounge in the US departures although it could be purchased. We boarded first and were offered a pre-flight drink. Both legs there and back were short so only snack and beverages were offered. Seats were comfortable and FAs were friendly and efficient. ATL is a great airport to transit through and is easy to transfer between flights/terminals and has good lounges. At both MIA and YYZ our luggage was on the belt promptly. Delta first class for this journey was about half of the cost compared to Canadian airlines flying the same route (although they flew direct).

Air Canada,7.0,W Woon,16th June 2014,NRT-YYZ on 77W (2-class i.e. older) AC2 on 31 May. It was a full flight I wanted to change my seat from the rear but I couldn't. Thought that AC deserved a little more credit amidst all the negative reviews on Skytrax which did scare me a little. I guess in general where delays or problems don't occur AC probably performs fine. Staff service was pleasant (occasionally a little less friendly). Food was surprisingly better than I expected: food looked and tasted decent (maybe it's catering from NRT) we were rather well-fed (2 meals + instant noodles) drink runs conducted regularly. Seat comfort was alright: standard fare comparable to other airlines cant really complain especially when their new 77W product seems so much worse. Quibbles arise from the in-flight entertainment: mine worked fine but the volume or sound system was not good - volume was at maximum but sound was still terribly muffled (I could only hear half of the conversation while watching movies making movies with heavy narration un-watchable). Other quibbles include the (at least 20 minutes) delays on departure and the very shaky ride we had due to turbulence - I suspect my seated at the rear of the plane meant more shaking. Overall I guess there has to be a reason why they're a Skytrax 4-star airline and winner of Best Airline in North America for 4 years in a row? I sure hope my return journey YYZ-NRT remains like this or better.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

On my return from a weekend in Las Vegas, I was exhausted and not that thrilled to be connecting red eye through LA to Boston, but so be it. So I was very pleasantly surprised when Virgin called me up to the gate to inform me that my flight was just delayed and I would miss my connection. So they had rebooked me on a JetBlue nonstop arriving earlier than my scheduled flight! The level of foresight was excellent, I hadn't even learned of the delay issue before they fixed it. And I got an exit row to boot. So my new favorite airline, Virgin America, is one I've still never flown! (Contrast this with my flight out to Vegas on American Airlines, which refused to let me fly standby to avoid a delayed flight, despite having plenty of open seats, because I didn't have 'status'. Thanks, American, for making me feel like a second class citizen even though your flight delay was causing my inconvenience.)

While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more, there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency, lack of decency (rude), and lower motivation to cooperate. However, instead of a hotel room, a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast, the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me.

The customer service on the phone when we called to change the seating back was rude and very unhelpful. The staff at the check in desk were able to help us on one of the flights and we were able to at least not all have middle seating.

This has been getting worse for the last 2 years and now so prevalent we will be shopping other airlines. No more fun, funny staff. They're not bad, just like the rest of the airlines. But not knowing when the plane will get to the destination just doesn't cut it. Lateness and cancellations galore. On the plus side, they still have the best luggage and change policy but it's now being trumped by the deficits. Often their prices range from the best to the worst on scheduled routes.

Firstly for a flight of 7-8 hrs the Boeing 757 is a small plane with little or no leg space and cramped up passengers cos seats are 3-3. Thus each time I need to go to washroom both middle seat and isle seat passengers need to get out of their seats too which is really inconvenient to all passengers. Secondly there was no inflight entertainment despite the crew restarting the system several times which is outrageous for a long haul flight. Furthermore, there was no apology from crew until the flight landed in Heathrow where the crew finally apologised and said passengers to go online and get an appreciation voucher from United. This when I did that it gave me a USD100 discount code on any United Airlines with many conditions attached to it, unfortunately I wonâ€™t be flying United again at any cost, therefore even this voucher is of no use.

American Airlines,1.0,Steve Jackinsky,23rd September 2015,"Wish I could rate American Airlines 0/10. Do not get the AA Advantage Card. There are barely any advantages. Fine print seems to be what American Airlines is all about with its loyalty program. We booked a multi-city trip with up to 8 days in a layover with our AA Advantage card, expecting to be charged for baggage on our international legs of the flight. But since we have the AA Advantage card, the domestic check is supposed to be free for the first bag for each person, up to 4, on the reservation. Well, American Airlines charged us for checked bags at every point. The agents claimed that we would have to call Customer Service to get reimbursed. Customer Service said that they could not do anything, so we have to go to the online site and leave a complaint. The American Airlines representative left a terse email stating that since all our flights were booked on the same itinerary, which included an international leg, we had to pay for checked baggage on every flight. We flew to 4 different cities in the US over the space of 2.5 weeks and were charged every time for baggage. What is supposed to be a benefit of our card that charges a $95 annual fee! So American is saying that we need to divide our travel reservation into international and domestic portions when purchasing our tickets in order to enjoy a complementary checked bag. The only perk: get 5% off if you buy the poor excuses for refreshments on American flights.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ANU to DTW via MIA,August 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,3.0,D Boothroyd,28th October 2014,AC 1173 to Vancouver on October 12 and returned to Toronto on AC 152 October 19. It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job.

The button to get attention means nothing as they either keep switching it off at the back or ignore it. The attendants were a bit rude when asking for more alcoholic beverages. Food was average.

American Airlines,1.0,S Wilson,8th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I would never fly American Airlines again. I planned a short weekend trip to visit my husband working in South Carolina. My flight was scheduled to leave Hartford at 1.00 pm on July 1st. We boarded on time and immediately started backing away from the gate. We then stopped and sat in place for 15 minutes and eventually returned to gate before sitting another 20 minutes. we were then told there were computer related issues and maintenance needed to be called. Apparently maintenance isn't stationed at the airport and was 30 minutes out. We were asked to deboard and wait and see. I had a 4.20 connector flight in Charlotte that was missed. The AA employees would not reschedule connections until they knew the status of the current flight. At 2.30 I received a call from AA with a new 6.20 connection time. Still no word on the current flight. At 3.00 we were told plane was fixed and reboarded. 30 minutes later we were still sitting at the gate. We were then told Charlotte airspace was closed and we needed to wait for reroute. We finally backed from gate at 3.40 and given permission to fly. At 3.50 we were then ""grounded"" for supposed weather. We sat on runway for another 30 minutes, and finally took off at 4.20. While on plane I asked the stewardess about making the 6.20 connection flight and was told she had no idea and couldn't find anything out. We landed in Charlotte at exactly 6.04. We landed at B gate. My connection was in E concourse. I sprinted the 1/2 mile to the gate and arrived at 6.15 for 6:20 flight. Plane was still there, doors still open. I was told I couldn't get on plane. I explained my flight was delayed 3 hours. I was rudely told I couldn't get on the plane and told to ""go around corner to reschedule"". I arrived at desk at 6.24 to rebook my connection. The attendant looked at his watch and asked why I didn't get on this plane. The next flight out was 5 hours later. I ended up requesting to fly to another airport having my husband drive 2 hours to pick me up. Flight home July 4: No problem from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte. Flight out of Charlotte scheduled for 8.20 pm to Hartford. Walked to gate to confirm location. Went to eat and came back to get to find gate was moved back to D concourse. Time also delayed 30 minutes. Time kept getting pushed back. A plane arrived and deboarded and were told we had to wait for service. At 9.00 we were told the plane was not cleared to fly. After 15 minutes we were sent back to B concourse. Boareded a plane there and again sat on plane for 30 minutes at gate awaiting who knows what. Ultimately took off 1.5 hours late. Overall poor customer service, significant delays, and no consideration for passengers who spent a lot of money to fly there airline. I will go back to JetBlue or Southwest for half the price and never experienced a problem with them.

Seats were okay for the short flight. Transferred at Munich Airport which was very neat and clean with a good bus ride from the plane to the terminal. The next flight LH-608 from Munich to Riyadh in an Airbus A330 (five hours) was the real deal! Seats weren't exactly the most comfortable out of all planes I've been on but it was good enough! Entertainment screens were quite unresponsive and not much of my interest but I have my iPod so I didn't mind. Managed to watch 2 episodes of Big Bang Theory and my sister watched Harry Potter (she was really happy that there were 5 Harry Potter movies available on the flight). Again excellent staff service (they smiled a lot for an added bonus) and I was surprised to get a really tasty meal (with Halal meat). Really well done for a non-middle-eastern airline!

From check in, as a One World Sapphire member, I was allowed to change seats to what other airlines called Premium Economy seats without further charge (AA do not operate a Premium E service but charge extra for these seats), great that as a One World Premium member I had this benefit.

The business class and first class connection between Dallas Fort Worth and Orlando then Orlando to Los Angeles on the return was comfortable. All flights and connections were on time. In fact one departed early to avoid a storm in LAX. The long haul transpacific flight offered a lie flat bed but that had a hump just at the small of your back. If you angle it 170, it disappears. Managed quite a number of hours of sleep. Food service and choice was more than adequate and of course the highlight was the sundae for dessert. However for breakfast they ran out of the egg option and had to settle for fruit and granola on both routes. Service was friendly and efficient. Late night snacks are available on demand and was good. The Bose noise reduction earphones were really effective, but the disposable ear-pieces on the short haul flights were not worth using.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,Jeri Carter,28th April 2019,"Not Verified | What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again.

But after one hour we boarded the A321 for Tel Aviv. The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom. The crew was nice and served a pre-drink, as the flight was about 20 minutes late, due to high traffic in the air. Soon after take-off they served a nice Gin and Tonic with nuts. After that they started the food service on a tray. The food was nice with starter, salad, main dish and fruits. After that they served coffee and chocolate.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,Marius Henkel,10th June 2016,"Delta Air Lines from Munich to Atlanta on an old Boeing 767-400ER, flight time 9:50. Pre-Boarding in MUC I was surprised by the captain stepping outside the plane and anouncing the flight infront of the whole B-Gates. Crew was nice and welcoming. I preordered veggie food and tasted like it was bought at a Wholefoods market. I have seen better Entertainment Systems with a wider selection of movies and TV shows, but it worked out fine for me and was easy to use. Atlanta serves as the biggest Delta Hub and makes it quite easy to transfer. It is the busiest airport in the world, though, so short connections are usually not reached. ATL to CVG was on a MD88, not the newest aircraft but clean and on time. It was full, so some passengers were offered to check their bags during boarding for free. Onboard service like any other domestic airline, but onboard WiFi seemed to have worked good. When I came to the baggage claim at CVG, my bags were already there, waiting for me. My flight back to MUC was from PHL on the new connection via DTW. Flight from PHL to DTW was on a Boeing 717-200 and delayed by 2 hours due to heavy thunderstorms in PHL and temporary airport closure during that time. Not Deltas fault and they seemed to do everything they could to rebook passengers with tight connections at DTW. Aircraft used was small and again packed full. Again basic service. DTW serves as Deltas second largest hub and is easy to get around since domestic and international Gates from Delta and partners are just across the hall. DTW-MUC again on an old B767-400ER, but with flawless service and nice selection of beers and wines even in Economy Basic. Also love the fact that the B767 has only two seats in the outer rows, which makes window seats even more attractive. Flight was only half full with plenty of room for sleeping.

We joked a bit, and they were quite friendly. The onboard service provided by the crew were also good. However, the food was basic, particularly for a flight over 8hrs. There was a hot meal service, portions were small. I had stuffed chicked served with rice, which was preceded by a nice seafood salad, and followed by a cheese platter. The champagne was ly bitter and undrinkable. The orange juice was not fresh but came out of a Minute Maid carton, unbefitting for the highest class Air Canada provides. The pre-landing snack was a very disappointing cold platter of sliced chicken breasts. The water on offer (Naya) didn't exactly reflect luxury. The one thing that appeared luxurious was the amenity kit with Escents toiletries. I would not recommend this for the extremely high price charged for business class.

We were one of the last to board and it was obvious we were together (tickets purchased together). Not one staff member tried to help and see if they could get us seats together. The icing on the cake was the horrible uncomfortable flight between two larger men. At this point I had fully decided, we would not fly Southwest again. Fortunately this flight was only 2.5hrs. Their flights are cheap, but I will pay the extra to a different airline to be comfortable, and to sit with the people I am flying with. I did notice that they let families flying with children board first which is great! I have two children that I would want with me too, had they been traveling with us.

I can't believe I chose them for my round trip, too. Some staff were nice, but many were rude. In fact, there was a front desk agent who was on his phone the whole time while I needed to get my flight changed. Every time I asked a question, he would answer like he was offended and I'm known to be one of the most polite people out there. He has basically inspired me to write this review. The only reason why they're not a flat out 0/10 is because there was one woman who found my wallet, came back all the way just as I was about to board my flight.

Lufthansa,1.0,G Zhang,31st July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I intended to take a flight from Basel to Munich and transfer to another one to Split. The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people. And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it.

Qatar Airways,10.0,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,29th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Bangkok ground staff are polite, but during boarding, it was the most chaotic scene. The Boeing 777-300 uses the 3-4-3 configuration. On this flight, the flight attendant serving my section was sub par of what I'm used to at Qatar airways. The food was fantastic. The flight to Frankfurt was on a brand new A350, with wide seats a the tail camera. I really like the exterior cameras! The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly. On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries. During disembarkation, I asked if I was able to get a photo with the captain. While waiting for the captain to come out of the cockpit, I was able to try out the business class seat and found it superior to Cathay Pacific's product.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,5.0,Christophe Vacher,1st September 2016,"Amsterdam to Los Angeles. It was my first time with KLM, and overall, my experience was just ok. The general feel of the airplane was that it needs to be updated. The food was ok, the seat and leg room were ok (although the reclining seat was clunky and didn't work very well), the staff was great, but the entertainment part was definitely behind, and there were no plugs for smart phones or computers. First, they didn't provide ear buds. I came prepared and had my own. Even if you have your own, you need to ask for an adapter, precisely because of the age of their entertainment system. Their entertainment system is old (think probably from the early 90s). The colors on the screen were awful and you could barely see anything. I skipped all the major blockbusters in the selection, because watching them in such poor conditions would be ridiculous. The choice of movies was ok, but quite average compared to other modern airlines. On top of all that, my unit was not working properly for the whole beginning of the trip, and because of that, the call button for the staff was also not working. Eventually, I was able to grab someone from the staff and they had to reset the unit. All this to say that, although I would still be ok recommending the airline, it would be with some serious reserves.

Emirates,1.0,A Anderson,9th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home.

United Airlines,3.0,A Miller,26th March 2014,First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage.

Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didnâ€™t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, itâ€™s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to itâ€™s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldnâ€™t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldnâ€™t even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers.

The biggest let down for me and why I will not be using Qatar again was because I am an emerald one world flyer I was greeted by a member of the cabin crew who took my meal order only to find when the meals were served I was asked again as my preference was no longer available. I explained I had made a previous order being an emerald member. This was also the case for the fast track lanes at passport control no fast track passes handed out which it states in the one world privileges. Doha airport is so much improved easy connections and very clean and professional.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,no

Jetblue Airways,9.0,A Hahn,6th June 2012,My family and I flew from Newark NJ to Fort Lauderdale FL return. Checking-in and boarding the flight to FLL went very smooth - in fact smoother than my previous flight with United Airlines. Onboard the flight in both directions the seats in the standard section were comfortable and of course we had the free DirectTV service. You also had free access to certain SiriusXM stations as well. The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks. Checking-in and boarding the flight to EWR was smooth even though there was 15-minute delay due to a deluge at the airport. The only consequence is that if you don't bring your headset you would have to pay for your own which is $2. Before they used to give them away for free but now they're charging for it.,,,,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,Michael Taksar,10th April 2011,The service at SVO airport is horrible. I flew to Copenhagen by SAS flight 8700 operated by Aeroflot. The agent wanted to charge me for the excess baggage. I tried to explain to her that on a code sharing flights I am governed by the rules of SAS not by Aeroflot rules. But she did not want to listen repeating again and again that she knew the rules. Eventually after a long verbal exchange she called the authorities and found out that I was right. In the Aeroflot lounge - which I was entitled to use in lieu of SAS lounge - the employee on duty refused to let me in. She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge. The same girl who did not allow me in eventually had to call and find out that she was wrong. She never apologized. In fact all the personnel there turned out to be so rude and incompetent.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no
Aeromexico,6.0,Jose Luis Heredia,10th November 2015,"Minatitlan to Morelia via Mexico City. I've flown with Aeromexico around 10 times for the last 30 days. This airline is usually the most expensive option in Mexico, but this time to my surprise it was the cheapest for most of the routes I travelled. They used to be a most punctual airline (it was even their slogan for years). Well, that's all in the past. 8 out of 10 flights were delayed. The minimum delay was 30 minutes and there I went to almost 5 hours (for one hour flights!). Their apology always came with the same excuse: Mexico City's airport is overcrowded, and its control tower keeps asking us to delay our flights. I would believe this if other airlines had the same problem. They don't. Flights going from the same airports to Mexico City, at the same time but with other airlines, were all on time, which of course was even more frustrating. Their planes are old in many cases, and all you get on board is 100 grams of salted peanuts and a small glass of Coke.

Alitalia,1.0,Stephen Brookes,21st February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Alitalia is a joke airline. My flight was delayed by 6 hours due to a fault in one of the engines. In London the ground crew did eventually try to find passage on other carriers, however some of the passengers were told that the plane had been fixed just as we got to the ticket counter of Lufthansa, so we had to go back through security which was a bit of a pain. There was no inflight entertainment and the inflight meals were very poor. The staff on the flight also seemed a bit stressy. We had delays at Rome also. I tried to get a change of carrier for the return trip from my agent, but the cost of doing so would have been excessive. The return flight was similarly poor although there were no delays. However when I arrived at Heathrow I found that they had managed to break my suitcase lock. When I went to the service desk they gave me a form and a claim number. I was tod to submit the form by email to their customer relations department. I sent my claim form as requested, however I was told that I had to download another form, fill it in, sign it and send a scan of this form and of my passport. I did this, but in error sent the unfilled form back instead of the signed scan. Any reasonable customer care department would realise that this was an error. I was told that I am no longer eligible for the compensation for my bag even though I subsequently sent the correct file.

Air Canada,4.0,Kylie McNamara,28th April 2015,After reading lots of negative reviews I was a bit nervous about flying with Air Canada! We have just returned from a 5 week holiday flying with Air Canada all the way through from Sydney-Vancouver-San Francisco-New York- Toronto-Tel Aviv and back again. We got quite a reasonable airfare and when I consider each of the flights we took over the duration of our stay I have to say that overall I have no real complaints. We had no delays to any of our flights no flight schedule changes no issues whatsoever. All of the staff including ground staff and flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and we had no negative interactions. Staff were lenient on a couple of occasions without baggage allowance and we never waited long at the check in counters. Long haul flights no matter which airline are generally arduous and uncomfortable but Air Canada was certainly not the worst airline we have ever flown. The food was a little hit and miss but then it is extraordinarily difficult to cater meals for everyone also we tended to always eat a proper sit down meal at the airport before boarding a long flight so we often just skipped the first meal anyhow. If Air Canada offers a similarly well priced fare for our next holiday we would definitely consider using them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Emirates,6.0,D Graubard,18th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Larnaca to Malta. This is the only way to get to Malta from Cyprus and it isn't a bad option. Bought a coach ticket and a few days before EK sent an email for an upgrade to Business for Euro 320. One-way business fare is Euro 800 so I thought what the heck - I'll do it. You get neither the car service pick-up nor access to the business class lounge - it's stated when you buy the upgrade - but I think I wouldn't do it again as it's totally ridiculous not to give you lounge access. Check-in was friendly and flight boarded on-time. They use the 7-across business Boeing 777-300ER for this route which is false advertising as the upgrade email said lie-flat seats in private all aisle-access seating. But I had the seat next to me free and enjoyed the space. ICE is always the best of any airline so can't fault entertainment system. Service - the key point - was the downfall. The FA serving my side was lacking much personality, hard to get her to smile but I did manage it once. The male FA was mostly flirting with the lady passengers behind me and not until we lifted off did he come by and introduce himself. Food was average - had the same in coach on other airlines. Cabin was clean and again seat was comfortable for the 2 1/2 hour trip. Landed on time but priority bags came out last - which was a pain as I had a car waiting for over an hour after I landed.

We had make our reservations 8 months ahead of time, I figured that flights can change last minute, and they must have overlooked this detail. I called them to make them aware of the problem. I sat on hold with them for over an hour, till the representative came back and said they couldn't do anything about it over the phone and I would have to go directly to the airport to fix the problem. But also assured me that there were plenty of seats left and not to worry. I didn't want to take a chance, so I went online to check in and paid an extra fee to upgrade our seat so that I could move them together. When we got to the airport, they had moved our seat again, and they were no longer together again. They told me the plane was full and they couldn't do anything about it. Nor would they refund the fee I paid earlier. I would of made more of a big deal about it, but there was a family of 5 with small children in front of me that they did this same thing to, with seats not near each other.

Overall KLM offers a good service and has a great flight network. However, as soon as something goes wrong, don't count on this airline. I have now experienced it for the second time that a flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions and KLM just did not manage to provide any support. There is a busy hotline and the fact that you may miss your original connection once bad weather hits is totally understandable. The way how KLM reacts to this, however, is incredibly bad. In both cases, the airline sent an e-mail telling us that they would contact us within the next three hours, but in fact, they never (not even after two days) write or call back. You cannot reach the hotline (you get disconnected after one hour of waiting) or their Whatsapp support. When I tried to re-book online (which they offer for free under these conditions and advice you to do in their cancellation e-mail), the online-system aborts the re-booking process and displays a random error message. What worked for me last time is to book a flight with another airline and ask for a ticket refund at KLM. In sum, the airline just dumped me and didn't manage to provide any support.

Emirates,7.0,Michael Kasberg,22nd February 2016,"Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai. Different service experiences. Flight HAM-DXB (EK 60) was on time, First was fully booked. Very good service by 2 attentive FA's and the purser. Wines were outstanding, 40 year old Port, excellent Cognac. Emirates First class food is a bit boring compared to Singapore Airlines and others where you can book your main course in advance. The second leg (EK 384 with A380) was a bad experience. Before take off in DXB I ordered my shower to have it 1.5hrs before landing. I was woken up very rudely by a female FA (she knocked loud on the door of my suite - on all flights before the FA's opened the door and woke up smoothly) and led me to the shower room. Normally in the meantime the FA's clean the suite and change the bed into a seat. When I came back after 20 minutes, nothing had happened, so I called the FA. Unwillingly she did their job and went away. Normally after having the shower the passenger were asked for their breakfast order. My FA was chatting with another pax and when some minutes later I called her and asked for breakfast she looked at her watch and told me, that in about 10 to 15 minutes we would start the descent and she could not serve me.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,L Barallat,2nd July 2016,"Travelled recently on Delta to Paris CDG, opting for the EWR flight as the time was more convenient than the earlier departure from JFK (I was using Delta Sky Miles for this segment). The Delta ""rotunda"" at EWR is actually a near-pleasant experience. For one, the departure time, just after 9pm, means its the last Delta departure out of EWR for the day and the entire security experience to gate was hassle free. The Amsterdam flight departs much earlier, at 6.30pm. The boarding area is standard Delta fare. There is a small Duty Free shop, some relatively tidy bathrooms, and one sports bar in the long corridor that leads to the gates. Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate. Flight push back was delayed 35-40 minutes due to a Sofia bound passenger that didn't board, and the luggage had to be removed from the hold. The plane was a 1991-build 767-300ER, which once flew for Gulf Air. Delta has done a nice job of renovating the interiors and even Economy Class was decent. AVOD was great as was the USB port to charge your phone. Meal service was nothing spectacular, but did the job for what is a 6 hour 30 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient, relatively friendly. Plane was in great condition. Arrived 25 minutes late and was on the curb within 15 minutes.

The seat is by far the biggest and most comfortable fully flat in Europe at the moment a dramatic improvement from the old World Business Class.

Lufthansa,1.0,T Girling,14th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment. I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11Â½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldnâ€™t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR.

Jetblue Airways,2.0,Rich Jenkins,18th July 2011,BOS-IAD. A dreadful experience. The flight was delayed and no information on further delays although they were obvious (e.g. crew lining up at what was supposed to be the departure). Well worn seats. Once on the plane we could not depart for 1hr. They easily could have kept us at the gate. The satellite radio is mostly obscurities and a lot of programming for political conservatives and evangelical Christians.

Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansaâ€™s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite â€œI belong hereâ€ demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was â€˜lights outâ€™, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although Iâ€™m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee. Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory â€œWillkommen to, Danke fÃ¼râ€ announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.",A340-600,Solo Leisure,First Class,EWR to DUS,December 2016,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Qatar Airways,9.0,Alan Wan,24th February 2015,Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival.

First, our flight on Monday from Geneva to Newark was problematic and when we landed we received a cell phone apology and told that we could receive a ""token"" concrete apology if we went online (no thanks). At Newark our direct flight to Milwaukee was first delayed two hours due to the crew not yet arriving and then it was cancelled entirely. UA first told us that we would not be able to fly out until Wednesday evening, two days later than our schedule and they would not pay for any hotel accommodations! There was a United flight to Milwaukee within the next two hours but it was full. When we again asked about flights to other airports they told us we could fly to Minneapolis, stay overnight at our own expense, and then fly to Chicago on Tuesday and then from Chicago to Milwaukee later that day. When we asked UA to pay for a Minneapolis hotel (they cancelled the flight!) the UA rep said that the cancellation was due to an ""air traffic control situation"" so UA wasn't going to do squat for us. We took the Minneapolis flight and the UA rep said our luggage would be put on that plane but when we arrived in Minneapolis the UA rep there told us our luggage was sent to Milwaukee! So no change of clothes or toiletries, just what we had in our carry on. The UA baggage chief in Minneapolis was curt and dismissive, and couldn't have cared less about us. We are now sitting in the Minneapolis Airport at 5 AM (and 4 hours of sleep in the hotel) after being in transit for 36 hours from Geneva, and can only wonder what is in store for us on the next two legs of our trip home. We have never experienced such poor service and no interest in customer care when foul ups occur on the airline's side. Avoid United Airlines!

Lufthansa,5.0,S Martin,29th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Newark to Kiev via Frankfurt, and returned from Vienna to Newark via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.",Boeing 747-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Kiev Boryspil/Vienna via Frankfurt,August 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Nathan Gau,2nd April 2016,"My recent experience flying out of Oakland to Indianapolis via Phoenix has shown that American will stoop to incredible lows when trying to avoid FAA regulations regarding oversold flights. Our flight was oversold, and when they could not find enough people to take their vouchers, they announced a last minute delay. They didnâ€™t follow any procedures for said delay. Their gate agents knew nothing and the flight information wasnâ€™t updated until sometime after I had boarded. Once onboard, we were told the delay was due to a leaky coffee pot. Iâ€™m still at a loss as to what safety issues were at stake for this issue. The flight attendant wasnâ€™t much better simply stating, â€˜you wouldnâ€™t water on the floor would you?â€™ Clearly there is a disconnect here, because missing a connecting flight over a little or even potentially a lot of water on the floor isnâ€™t worth it, especially on a holiday weekend where my plans for the following day ended up completely ruined. Myself and probably a dozen other people missed our connecting flights. In my case, I arrived at my gate just as my plane was pushing off. My destination wasnâ€™t a hub, and the people managing this flight couldnâ€™t wait five more minutes to allow myself and the other two passengers who arrived at the same time I did, the courtesy to board. The next flight was four hours later (on a red-eye), and for my inconvenience, I got a meal voucher that would only be able to pay for a fast food dinner. Running through Phoenix, my laptop bag managed to open up causing my laptop to fall out. My experience with AA customer service wasnâ€™t much better. They donâ€™t get back right away, and they refused to escalate this. To this day, Iâ€™m still trying to figure out how a leaky coffee pot presents any real safety issue worthy of grounding a flight, and customer service didnâ€™t have a good reason for it either. I was offered a measly 10,000 bonus miles, worth nowhere near what the travel voucher I should have received for essentially being involuntarily bumped. That will get you (if youâ€™re lucky) one third of a domestic ticket, and not at all worth the inconvenience that was forced on me and fellow passengers. At best, this was someoneâ€™s incompetence. At worst, this was an unethical way for an airline to save a few thousand dollars. If it has really come to something like this to make a few extra dollars, then perhaps itâ€™s time for their customers to find an airline that respects them a bit more.",,Business,Economy Class,OAK to IND via PHX,March 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,4.0,J Gardner,12th June 2014,We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,no

I am traveling with a family of 6, and we just got the economy boarding.

When we began boarding our attendant was very rude and asked us why we were taking our personal item when we â€œwerenâ€™t allowed anything on the planeâ€ I proceeded to tell her that we got the â€œokâ€ from the front check-in as well as when we flew from Portland to Houston. Again, she was rude and said we had to pay in order to have our items on the plane and if not that we could just stay here. She was like â€œtell me know are you going or are you staying.â€ I decided to then pay, thinking that it would be the same amount as our checked bags, but no, it was $180 for two personal item bags. $180 + a rude attendant. But of course, we have no choice, who would want to leave their things behind? After paying and waking to board the plane, she proceeded to follow us and tell us to hurry up basically chasing us down the hall. When we got to the door there was a serviceman fixing something so we couldnâ€™t actually step in",,,,,,,,,,,,

American Airlines,2.0,A Miller,26th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew American Airlines from Santa Ana to Philadelphia via Dallas Fort Worth. I missed my scheduled flight and had to rebook, the representative at the airport put me on standby for a flight several hours later, telling me that I would ""probably get on."" However, the flight was full, and after waiting around for over three hours I rebooked for the following day. I arrived at the airport two hours early this time, only to find my first flight had been delayed by two hours. I received a message on my phone that this might cause me to miss my connection in Chicago, so I attempted to change flights via mobile website. However, upon submission it displayed an error message about the action not being completed. So I decided to wait, hoping the delay wouldn't make me miss my connection. Unfortunately, despite what the online booking told me, they had in fact given my seat on the first flight away. The attendants were very helpful and I was able to get onto a flight to Dallas Fort Worth, where I could pick up a connection home. But this new flight was full enough that I was required to check my carry-on. The flight was fine but when I arrived in Dallas, I found my connecting flight wasn't for another hour. I settled in to wait, but after only half an hour or so, it was announced that the flight had been delayed by two more hours. And because I was forced to check my bag, I had no way of changing to an earlier flight. The staff were nice enough to put out some drinks and snacks, but I'm unsure of whether that was organized by American or by the airport. The second flight had no in-flight entertainment or even an outlet, though the staff were pleasant. Overall not a great flight experience. I don't think I will be flying with American again without having done some thorough research first.","Boeing 737, A321",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Ana to Philadelphia via Dallas,February 2018,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Hunter James,28th November 2015,"I have never had such a bad experience on a plane in my life. I was coming back to Atlanta from the Bahamas with American Airlines but I had a connecting flight through Miami. Getting onto the plane they made me check my carry-on because they had reached capacity (even though I was in the second group). I was hesitant doing so but I did as they asked. When we landed I waited for an hour and half in baggage claim before they told me where it was. They had left the bag in Miami because the plane was too heavy and couldn't carry anymore bags. (They didn't even tell me they were doing this.) The worst part was that I was going to the Auburn Alabama game in the morning and my ticket was in that bag so I had to miss the game. Also the rest of my family's bags were scuffed, one of the bags had the zipper ripped off and the pocket in the front ripped off as well. They asked if American Airlines would fix it or replace it and they refused to do either. The fact that I am actually taking the time to write this review is how angry I am.

Overall journey was pleasant, departure was nearly half-an-hour late due to offloading luggage of passengers who could not travel that day, but the captain promised to make up the time lost throughout the flight. Arrival was on time as scheduled. A380 a joy to travel in. What could be better is if the departure gate in Dubai allows for 2 level entries, as premium passengers were boarded through the lower entry door, which could be problematic for elderly passengers as they have to go up on a stairs to the business cabin. Male amenity kit bag has been shrunk which is good. The content remains the same. The service is good with crew members working hard. A minor tweak on the menu since the last time and improvement was noticed in this flight. Poach eggs served on the breakfast menu in this flight has improved since the last flight I took. Wifi still not really working. Due to recent event in San Bernardino, I was held up at the LAX immigration, due to the origin of my travel was from an Arab country.

I really like that the airline treats adults as adults and not like children, they have a more hands off attitude, non hovering. The system is quite efficient and flows well. There don't appear to be any meals on board which became a problem on our return from JFK to LAX. The plane was boarded 3 hours late, each update was another 15 minute delay making it impossible to get some food before boarding. We ate a small breakfast thinking we could easily get to our destination as scheduled and eat an early dinner once in LA. The delay made the on flight snacks barely adequate and we were starving once we arrived. There are no healthy snacks, the only offerings are potato chip type bags with carbohydrate and fat loaded ingredients. I guess that's ok if your 20 years old but for many it is undesirable,unhealthy and inadequate. When my wifes Southwest flight was delayed two hours she received a $100 voucher, so far we have seen nothing from Jet Blue and that's okay, we understand delays occur but they need to have contingency preparations in place. There are many things to like about Jet Blue, the seats are very comfortable, the legroom is good, the entertainment screens are excellent. This is an airline that wants to excel, and I think it does, perhaps the decision makers need to take a flight and experience what the traveler experiences and they would understand any deficiencies better. One last thing, the cabin temperature was very cold, I am 63 and needed a jacket, often times I think my age makes me less tolerant of cold but the 30 year old lady sitting next to me had the blanket on and couldn't cover up enough, she was also quite uncomfortable.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,July 2018,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes

I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers - it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane.

Jetblue Airways,1.0,Debra Kearns,11th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Richmond to Punta Cana via Fort Lauderdale/Boston. Just perused recent reviews and feel like my story was already told! Numerous times. Worst trip ever - coming and going! Left Richmond VA for Punta Cana, DR via Fort Lauderdale on Aug 3. #645/#173. 2.5 hour delay from FL because apparently, Jetblue neglected to assign a pilot to the flight! Called Jetblue from terminal, and was informed that I must have misunderstood gate employee as no one from Jetblue would ever make such an announcement re: the lack of a pilot! I explained to rep that we were meeting group from NY in DR to share hour transport to hotel that had already been paid for. Rep went on to explain they would need at least 5 days to evaluate who was at fault for the delay of a flight with no pilot assigned and to call back at that time to see if we would be compensated. Needless to say we had to pay another $70.00 for transport to hotel. Return trip: From Punta Cana, DR to Boston (#896) for lay over, then on to Richmond VA.(#1281). Left DR at 12:48 with 5:00 arrival time in Boston to catch a 6:50 connection to Richmond. When we were still in the air at 5:15, expressed concern to flight attendant that we would be unable to get through customs and traverse the entire airport in what was looking like less than an hour. We were assured we would have no problem. Landed and got off plane about 5:35, flew through terminal begging anyone who would listen, customs, Jetblue employees, TSA, etc. that we had a connecting flight. They couldn't care less. Even had Jetblue employee send us in the totally wrong direction dragging 3 suitcases which probably cost us at least 15 precious minutes. Thank God for the other passengers on TSA line who let us cut to front! My poor husband got through 1st and went flying to gate to beg that they await our arrival only to discover flight had already closed doors at 6:35! First we were told there was another flight to Richmond at 7:00. Then we were informed that was a mistake, the next was at 9:00 pm. Asked to speak with supervisor who was only interested in the specifics of our flight times, and then informed us that the problem was with whomever booked our flight as Jetblue always recommends at least 2 hours between connecting flights to avoid exactly what we just went through. When we informed him we had booked the entire trip through Jetblue Vacations, and shouldn't his airline know their own policy, he had nothing to say! In the middle of exchange, another employee came over, whispered in his ear and and he took off-no explanation. After waiting 20 minutes because of course, the supervisor of an airline in the middle of hearing a complaint from one of their customers would return, we went looking for him! Found him behind a counter talking to another employee. Watched for about 5/10 minutes until he turned around and saw me. This guy had no intention of returning to finish our conversation! So-long story short, we got a $40 voucher for food which in airline-ese is 2 hamburgers - found out our luggage had somehow made the very flight we missed and got home to Richmond at midnight. Note: Flight crew on #381 were fabulous, as was unknown employee at Logan check in counter who somehow got our liquor boxed and on flight after another Jetblue employee gave us the totally wrong info on how to transport!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Punta Cana,August 2017,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

News about the strike has been reported by several international news outlets since last week, and the strike is expected to shut down the whole country, including Brussels airport. However, American says they have not received any notice from HQ and so cannot make a change to my reservation without applying a fee. After receiving that same answer 3 times, I asked if I could get the number for HQ, but when I called and made my way through the 15 or so prompts to customer service, I received an automated message that they were closed and I should call back during regular business hours (it was 11am on a Tuesday mind you). Now I understand that procedures are there for a reason, and that the airline makes a pretty penny on ticket changes, but in cases like this one where it is clear no flights will take off from Bru on Feb 13th, why is it that I have to beg AA to look into the issue and be proactive about changing my reservation? I must be back stateside on the 13th, but what I fear is that I will get a message on the 12th telling me the flight has been cancelled and I am rebooked for the 14th, 15th or even later. Overall, I am frustrated with the AA Advantage experience and reps & supervisors telling me their hands are tied until HQ gives them the go ahead. I am also frustrated that despite being a loyal customer for the last several years I feel like AA is giving me the runaround and could care less about my concern re getting back on the 13th.

American Airlines,1.0,C Noth,8th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Hands down the worst airline I have ever flown on. Delayed the flight at least 7 times and ended up finally saying that the flight would leave at 930pm instead of 1040am. Which left me no choice but to rent a car and drive from North Carolina to New Jersey as I missed my connecting flight in Charlotte. Will never fly with this airline again. So a big thank you to American Airlines for forcing me to drive up the coast for over 9 hours, last minute, and ensuring I donâ€™t get home until far past midnight. Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline at all costs. Also, in an attempt to appease the room full of people who definitely didnâ€™t get where they paid to go, they handed out expired snacks.

Air Canada,8.0,J Ross,17th May 2014,HKG-YVR Boeing 777-300 New configuration. A nightmare that even embarrasses the flight crew to apologise for it. I am a 100K Aeroplan member and this dreadful experience led me to avoid Air Canada since. With other airlines upgrading their already superior products one is left to wonder why Air Canada has chosen to downgrade theirs. I can only imagine the plight in economy where an extra seat has been jammed into each row. On a positive note I have discovered the advantages offered by the competition - of which there is plenty. There may be a short term increase in yields as passengers are crammed into airplanes but the damage to long standing customer loyalty will sadly endure.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Firstly, we sat in our plane on the runway way for 2 hours before taking off (being told mixed stories as to why we were delayed). We missed our connecting flight (and our upgraded seats we paid for and had to basically argue about upon arriving). When we finally got to our destination (3 hours late and missing our transportation we had paid for) our luggage was missing. The employees had zero empathy for us for our travel day from hell and handed us a form for our lost luggage (the form had a contact number which we couldn't get through to the following day after multiple attempts of calling). We were told to buy what we needed and we would be reimbursed (we had literally nothing until we got our luggage the following evening). A month after I began the reimbursement process I received a response from American Airlines stating that they don't reimburse for personal belongings due to lost luggage although it's clearly stated that they do on their website.

Emirates,2.0,Frank Pollacchi,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline. I fly to Australia at least once a year - I'll be looking at alternative airlines from now on.

While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate. I felt I shouldn't have to pay for something g that wasn't my fault. So I got to spend 12+ hours in the terminal. Never flying Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Southwest Airlines,,J Webber,31st May 2011,"Extremely disappointed in Southwest's recent changes to the policy on the inability to change a passenger name once the ticket has been purchased. I bought a ticket for an employee before this policy took effect who was not able to make the trip. Since then SW started supposedly ""enforcing a policy that has been in place"" without any sort of notification. Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals",,,,,,,,,,,,

United Airlines,1.0,G Meares,2nd February 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | I booked this ticket exactly a week ago. The app told me it was a 92% that the plane is on time. So of course I get to Houston just to find out the plane is late due to maintenance. I purposely chose this flight because it landed at 3 and i worked at 5. But now my flight does not arrive in TPA until 4. So now I do not have a ride and the Uber home is 45$. I have already paid 354.82$ with no carry on just so I could get out of the airport quickly. The ladies at the desk in Houston were so rude asking me why I am questioning them and they do not provide ground transportation. I contacted customer service only for her to tell me file the claim and they will get back to me in 7 days. After this I went to the customer service desk located in section C in the Houston airport. The gentleman there was the kindest and reassured me I would get reimbursed for something because itâ€™s a plane issue which means itâ€™s United fault but I cannot handle the situation until I get to Tampa. So now my options are a 45$ Uber or I have no way of getting home. As I walk the hallways I see signs saying United #1 in on time departures and then I get to the website and see there are so many complaints about flight delays and not because of weather.

However, the food was really mediocre and absolutely not ""luxe"", the AVOD was very limited (thankfully I had downloaded videos of my own on my device), the screens for the AVOD was distorted and blurry at times, the remote control for the AVOD never worked except to turn on the lights overhead, and the seats when fully reclined were very confining in the feet area and not long enough for a 185 cm person like myself.

The contempt that AA obviously has for its customers was quite an eye opener with not one ounce of customer service or care given at all, many of the passengers were Americans trying to get home to family for Thanksgiving. Whilst we all understand mechanical issues have to be dealt with and safety being paramount, you also need to have some level of empathy and a duty of care for your customers and there was a way AA could have dealt with a cancelled flight but they failed big time. Also listening to staff whispering and discussing ongoing maintenance issues with this aircraft does not instill confidence. I will not give this airline another chance.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4.0,Farouk Mogheth,9th January 2011,Bangkok-Moscow-Prague and return. I tried Aeroflot again and my decision was made on the basis of the facts that they use new A330 on their longhaul which is a big step forward compared to their Il96 Russian aircraft and Aerflot flights and Skyteam partners moved to the newly opened Terminal E and D in Sheremetyovo which is supposed to shelter the passengers from the horrors of what is now called Terminal F. The flight from BKK was okay check in was problem free the boarding process was chaotic as usual and staff completely uninterested to help. To my horror we parked at the older terminal and it was the same story all over again. Horrible terminal with sad staff barking at passengers overcrowded old terminal with people sitting on the ground. I consider it as false advertising and clearly the airline lied as my reservations stated all flights were to fly to/from the new terminal. The A330 new and still clean onboard entertainment limited but okay a small number of films and a very limited music choice. The food was good and portions sufficient only one drink then totally zero cabin presence. After the meal the crew hid for at least 8 hours at the back of the plane and ignored many calls for service. They shamelessly kept hauling business class food for what it seems as their own private party at the back galley. Toilets filthy as no one checks on them. The same thing at the return flight. Beware that Aeroflot Bangkok flights are predominantly family oriented so there will be a large % of infants on board which can get very tricky with a plethora of babies yelling all through the red eye flight in unison. Aeroflot's greatest weakness is in its crew - sad robotic and no eye contact whatsoever. Thanks for the flight but I guess Ill give someone else my business until I see a considerable move forward from Aeroflot.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no

On each occasion I was told they would try to get me my dining options subject to what their colleague had been asked for in the other aisle. I formed the impression that there was calculated stocking of food and using up depleted stocks of their excellent drinks cellar. I spoke to the cabin director on one matter. The business class seat layout of the Boeing 787 is 1x2x1. My wife and I sat in the middle with the children on either side.

Entertainment options was decent and they had some recent movies as part of their selection. My only complaint is that the screen was extremely unresponsive. Food was average ordered the Seafood Meal and it was delicious. The pre-arrival snack was a disappointment it was literally the same tuna salad served as the side during dinner but slapped between sliced bread. Crew was professional and efficient but were not warm or friendly. Only complaint in terms of service is the lack of beverage runs during the flight. They seem to be too worried resting in their crew rests area (at the back of the plane) and even turned off my service call without asking me if I needed anything. Appalling.

Air Canada,1.0,Maryam Sabour,3rd August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to San Francisco. Air Canada has a problem in their system where they can't get the spelling of my name right. Every time I make a booking the system deletes the last letter of my name ""Maryam"" becomes ""Marya"". Because of this, I can never check-in online at their system and with any booking I have to see an in person agent every time. As a frequent flyer for business, I am a NEXUS holder, never check baggage and always check-in online to avoid long waiting lines. However because of this problem I will forever have to get to airport early, and stand in line to have an agent correct my name on my boarding pass otherwise security will not let me through with the error on my boarding pass. Last week I flew to SFO from YYZ and Air Canada refused to let me bypass an-hour long line to have the change made and get on to my flight. They told me security would not have a problem letting me through but of course what happened? Security would not let me through and made me go back and stand in line for the Air Canada agent to change my name on the boarding pass. This is insane for an airline like Air Canada to not solve a problem that affects every person whose first name ends in the letter ""M"". They told me the system thinks that ""M"" stands for Mr. or Ms. so it gets mixed up.

We paid for the even more space seats and we were squeezed in them. The seat space is just the distance from seat to seat.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,O Vuorenmaa,10th December 2013,We flew Helsinki-Istanbul-Kigali and Mombasa-Istanbul-Helsinki recently. The online booking and check-in was easy the website is very user friendly (no OLCI at Mombasa though). The planes on HEL-IST-HEL were Airbus equipment one older and one new with state-of-the-art entertainment system. The older one had only overhead screens showing flight tracking only. The seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom. On African sectors brand new B 737-900ER were used. These planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies. I must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes I ever flown with. On all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when I last could select my meals from menu card in economy class. The cabin service was professional and friendly. Some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off. All flights arrived on-time and bags delivered. As all flights were normal I cannot comment how the problem situations are handled. For us the round- trip was perfect and I have no hesitation to use Turkish again.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

There is no doubt that the window seats on the upper deck are absolutely fantastic. Big screen TV private and comfortable. Outbound to Auckland the service was very slow and I only ate breakfast 20 minutes before descent. On the return flight no such problems. The bar is a nice touch and usable unlike similar products on 777's.

When I went to put my one carry on bag in the bins above my seat they were full, and the flight attendant gave me a dirty look and said to put it in a bin behind me. This meant I had to put it about 7 rows behind me. The result was when we landed, I had to wait for everyone to leave plane before I got to get my carry on. The reason the bin above me was full was the flight attendant allowed the couple to our left to use two bins for their carry on baggage. When I pay for a ticket I expect to be able to stow at least one carry on above me in the bin. My opinion was the flight attendant could not care less. The other problem is the seats are about 17"" wide and have little recline. I think the management at United needs to try flying and sitting in one of these seats for a 7 hour flight and see how they like it. Overall the service and seating was horrible.

The seats had a decent width and pitch and the IFE and onboard connectivity are always good. Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment. On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule. The journey was comfortable and pleasant enough although let down by a haphazard soft product and poor food offering.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DXB to PER,September 2016,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no
Delta Air Lines,1.0,Liz Oquendo,2nd July 2015,"The flight was delayed. The boarding process was unorganized and a complete mess. We were the last ones to board and by the time we got to the entrance, my bag was automatically taken to be sent with the rest of the cargo because the flight was full and there was no space. When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag. The crew were also unprofessional and tried to argue the fact that once the bag is checked that there was nothing for them to do and that's how things are.

Will be doing the same flight soon in Premium Economy which looks very inviting and I did try out the PE seats. I also checked the economy cabin and I am not about to experience it. On their downward spiral on customer comfort this is a high density cabin to be avoided.

United Airlines,1.0,Cathy Boyd,1st July 2014,The trip from Little Rock to Moline was fairly uneventful except for a delay due to weather in Chicago. That is understandable. However the return trip from Moline to Little Rock was a complete disaster! Our flight from Moline to Chicago was delayed for crew time-out. Really? Our flight had been scheduled for over 2 months. Surely that is enough time to prepare for an available crew. Naturally even though we ran as fast as we could not easy for 60+ year old people we missed our connecting flight. Then we spent another 2 hours waiting in line to find another airline. Not allowed to mention lost luggage. Horrible experience.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,2.0,E Blatt,23rd March 2015,I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly.

I had to leave things at the gates before I was allowed to board. I wrote to customer service and although they apologised for the attitude and behaviour of their staff they were not clear about cabin luggage policy. In their own words â€œ I must point out that Emirates hand baggage allowance for Economy class passengers has always been one piece not exceeding 7kgs. Naturally, we allow reasonable quantities of duty free goods in addition to the above, however it would appear that the total weight off your hand luggage when reporting at the gate for your flight was exceeding your allowanceâ€. I emailed them back asking for clarity about what reasonable quantity of duty free goods is but they had no explanation. On board food was average with one meal served for this 7 Hour flight.

Lufthansa,5.0,O Benyehuda,17th March 2015,Flew Business Class from Newark to Stockholm and return to JFK both via Frankfurt. Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice.

Air Canada has a regularly scheduled 7am flight from Pittsburgh to Toronto that connects with many flights headed to the Caribbean. In our case, on Feb. 4 we intended to connect with a flight to Barbados, from where we would take a short flight to Union Island in the Grenadines and then a short ferry to Palm Island. Problem is: Air Canada cancels this flight - and not infrequently. On this day, Air Canada cited the reason as lack of crew. Really? You can't schedule adequate crew? And Air Canada didn't tell us it canceled the flight until we were on our way to the airport at 5 a.m. What are we to do then? In our case, we had only one other option, which was to buy a last-minute ticket on JetBlue via Fort Lauderdale for $772. Unfortunately, the flight got us in too late to make the connection to Union Island, which means we had to pay for a hotel in Barbados and repurchase the $285 non-refundable airfare to Union Island -- not to mention forfeit the first night at our final destination. Air Canada doesn't compensate you for the cancellation, other than to refund the original one-way ticket. They gave us coupons worth $300 Canadian.

Upon arrival, they said our bags were too big (they were soft so they fit in the box but they measured it using a weird machine that didnâ€™t compact it) and charged us 90â‚¬, more than we paid for our miserable early morning tickets.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,T Barlin,20th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",A330 / A321,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul,February 2019,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Tried to change the seats at the gate before boarding as we were instructed to do so by the airline staff upon checking in our bags but dealing with the ground staff at Gate 14 Terminal 8 in JFK was an absolutely shocking experience.

United Airlines,1.0,Loay Osman,4th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Chicago via Los Angeles. On a business trip. Aircraft were relatively old and nothing special about the crew or the flights. The problem occurred when was flying from ORD to NYC LaGuardia LGA flight was supposed to leave at 5pm suddenly flight got cancelled without further information except due to weather conditions. The 4pm flight is going ahead and the 6pm flight as well. To my surprise the 3pm, 5pm and 7pm flights are cancelled to NYC however the 4pm, 6pm and 8pm flights are normal operation. Then the chaos started tried to rebook myself on a standby for the 6pm flight didnâ€™t work out checked with the United staff and they are probably deaf or not listening or helping not knowing where my luggage are or how to locate them or where to go. No one from the ground staff is helping and all they say itâ€™s due to weather we canâ€™t help you and thereâ€™s no further flights to NYC till tomorrow afternoon while I have to attend an important meeting at 8:30AM. This situation was just a joke. Eventually located my luggage which already been sent to LGA on the 6pm flight which I donâ€™t understand how would they send luggage without the passenger being on board the flight and had to queue with my colleague for almost 2 hours to rebook ourselves. When we reached the counter the only option the clerk gave us was to rebook to Hartford which is 2 hrs away from NYC we had to accept that and sort ourselves from Hartford then that particular flight got delayed which makes it arrive in Hartford at 3am which impossible for us to find our way to NYC. Eventually we booked ourselves on a different airline and paid 500 USD each for a one way ticket from Chicago to New York City. Seriously the most unorganised airline in the world. Later on we discovered that they had a system failure and thatâ€™s why they couldnâ€™t operate certain flights but to avoid compensating passengers or booking hotels for them they delcraed itâ€™s due to weather.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,G Morton,1st January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dammam to Amsterdam. Watch out if you pay for an upgrade and are unlucky enough to either get downgraded or have a cancelled flights. You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told ""the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight"". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone ""It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class"". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. All in all KLM are not customer focused and are only focused on your money, making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. Whilst flying out of Dammam we have had our flight delayed (above flight) due to fog, we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information, hotel, transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. It took KLM 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport, and still we were not given any information. We were told by the KLM business lounge rep "" I will cancel your exit stamp and you can go and sort yourself out until the next flight"".

Lufthansa,3.0,K Nyman Metcalf,24th July 2015,"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not LufthansaÂ´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew.

A one and a half hour flight turned into 6 hours due to a pilot and the weather. Before returning home I got a alert that my flight was cancelled and that I needed to call Delta. There was a 3 hr wait time. When I called again later, I waited another hour before finally speaking with someone. She stated there were no flights leaving LGA for the rest of the week, and I find that hard to believe. She stated the only flight leaving LGA was at 6 am the very next morning and there was a possibility that the flight may not even take off due to weather conditions. I asked if I could have credit for a train or a bus at a later time. I understand that tickets are non refundable, but in the situation, I needed an alternative option.

United Airlines,1.0,T Piprek,22nd May 2015,I had booked a trip to Hong Kong through Flight Network. on the way there (14 hour flight) the plane did not have any entertainment units or even a plug in for a laptop. On our way back we were to go from Hong Kong to San Francisco and then from San Francisco to Edmonton. United Airlines had switched the connecting flight to go through Chicago instead of San Francisco which I only found out when checking in on our departure day. The attendant at the United desk was unable to provide an explanation as to why the connection was switched and was basically of no help. This ended up amounting to a 9 hour delay and me missing a day at work.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no

I have been on a flight that they overbooked by 40 people coming back from Switzerland. I have flown with them to Shanghai in the summer of 2017 and the flight was not only delayed by 13 hours but they also kept us on the plane for 8 of those hours without providing us any reasoning or even doing the simple act of giving us water.

The new leather seat design looks nice and modern. On the 5 hours leg PHX-SJO you get a sandwich and They come around twice with drinks and non alcoholic beverages are for free. The captain or co comes out of the cockpit and greets the pax when they deplane. That's a very nice touch. They offer a good selection of movies and TV series for free, but you have to stream those via your phone or laptop since they got rid of the IFEs.

American Airlines,1.0,Mary Carbajal,21st June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines from Los Angeles to Kahului. From the moment I stepped out of the car every employee was so rude. I selected seats when I made the reservation. They disappeared. I had to go to the customer service counter. At Los Angeles there were 2, yes only 2 employees at the counter. I was surrounded by self-service kiosks that would not address my issue. The line was incredibly long. An employee told me to go outside to the curb and use the curbside service to check in. I approached the employee and asked if he could check us in. He could not give me a direct answer. He had a terrible attitude and was condescending and rude. When he finally looked up the reservation he said he could not check us in because there was a problem. We went back to the line and started over again. Finally at the counter we got checked in. On the plane things didn't get any better. The service was so bad. The passenger next to me was traveling with a young child seated across the aisle. We moved around so the child could be sitting with one of his parents. The passenger asked if he could have 2 tiny snacks. The flight attendant adamantly refused stating only 1 was allowed. The passenger on my right asked the attendant if she could take her cup of water away. The attendant said - ""I can't do that right now"" and never returned. Granted these are minor issues but the attitude of every single employee was so rude. This is a service industry. There are so many choices. This was by far the worst choice I have made. I booked 5 tickets and selected seats. My seat assignment disappeared and we were randomly seated. This was the beginning of a very unpleasant flight.

A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent. Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised! The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful.

Emirates,7.0,G Burton,25th May 2015,EK435 Brisbane to Dubai A380. It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen. Overall and an average long haul experience slightly better than I expected. I would use again if the price point was enticing.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,3.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,4.0,Fidelis Kamuntu,28th November 2015,"I'm not a kind of traveler that ever complains or ever taken a survey to evaluate the quality of service. Today however is different. I've been pushed to the limit and will make a note, of the terrible service that I've received on Delta. I'm on flight AF9301 seat 41H from Minneapolis to Paris CDG. Flight attendant takes the poor Delta service to a new low. First, she is ramming her food cart onto seats and passengers shoulders and proceeds with no remorse or even a simple excuse me. Just passed with a drinks cart, looks like she looks at faces, and chooses who she will ask if they need a drink or not. She clearly ignored me as I awaited to get a drink, and I must say, I have never felt disrespected this much. I had to politely ask another attendant if drinks were for purchase or complementary, just to calm my head. Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman.

No regard for their customers, they should just be honest so that people can make arrangements early. Flew them again (no other flights ) last week, and low and behold, the same thing happened again.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,H Peelar,12th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Calgary via Seattle. This is a terrible airline. For the round trip, every flight was extremely late in it's boarding. Then, all of a sudden, our last flight got delayed by 3 hours. When we asked why, the Delta rep told us it was because of maintenance that the plane underwent earlier that morning, which apparently pushed everything behind schedule. What makes no sense is the fact that if the maintenance was undertaken in the morning and the schedule pushed back so much, why did it take until 10 minutes before out flight to make us aware of the huge delay? And why was the situation not rectified in any way? We did not receive any kind of compensation at all, and the only recognition of their fault was in one line in an email reading 'Apologies for the inconvenience.' This apology did not help me get to work the following day like I had planned. And I don't need a stupid travel voucher from this terrible company.

United Airlines,7.0,L Spencer,14th September 2014,Just returned from USA flying both ways with United. 3rd flight this year flying with United to SFO connecting to ACV (Eureka). United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

They delivered our luggage in the middle of the night and when we opened it in the morning, everything was drenched and much of our clothes were ruined. White clothes had blue stains on them.

United Airlines,8.0,N Shannon,15th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Los Angeles. I have heard several different things about United's long-haul product, so I didn't know what to expect. Whatever expectations I did have on United's long-haul product were exceeded. Due to the fact that it was a flight to the United States, we had to go through additional security checks and ""recheck-in"" at a United service counter. It was a quick and efficient process. Our flight departed Heathrow thirty minutes past the scheduled time. The flight was nearly full, and I had a window seat on this flight. The seat configuration on the 787 was a 3-3-3. Once in the air, a refreshments service occurred, which was followed by lunch. There were two options: chicken or pasta. I opted for the pasta, and it was pretty decent. It came with some sort of grain and corn salad, as well as a bread roll, butter, cheese and crackers. It was a good portion of food. The United Economy seat was very comfortable with heaps of legroom by economy standards. It is made of leather and reclines relatively far back. The inflight entertainment was outstanding, with plenty of choices and a very modern and responsive touchscreen. The seat was also fully wired with a headphone jack, a USB port and a power outlet below the seat. In addition, I would definitely recommend flying on the 787 because the windows are much larger and darken at the touch of a button. The inflight service was okay, not up to par with Lufthansa or Austrian. Although it was a day flight, I got four hours of sleep with the blanket and pillow provided, both very comfortable. Before arrival we were served a warm turkey sandwich, as well as fresh fruit, chips and a cookie. All of it was delicious, especially the fruit, which was a nice touch. We landed in Los Angeles 18 minutes before scheduled arrival. Overall, United's hard product (the seat and entertainment) are outstanding, however their service needs a little work. I would recommend United Airlines and I certainly look forward to flying them again.",Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,August 2018,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

The American gate next to it, had 5 employees, talking, laughing, not doing anything. I went over to them and asked if they could help me. I had been in my line for 30 minutes and the employee had only gotten through 2 people! So you can imagine the anger of everyone in line! The 5 employees at the adjacent gate said they couldn't help and really didn't seem to care enough to walk over to our gate to help that 1 lone employee. I found that to be so incompetent for this or any airlines. Worst part for me was, my daughter was gong to the same wedding, also flew out from the same airport, same time, with JetBlue.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Michael Asher,1st July 2014,Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either. But at least I was able to go to the airport shop and buy a can of Coke for TL 1.75!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,5.0,yes

The flight and stewards were excellent however the trouble came when checking in at Auckland airport to come back to LA. We were going through to customs and a lady called us and said we needed to weigh our two carry on bags. Apparently they have to weigh less than 7kg and one bag weighed 9kg and the other was 11kg. My carry on bag itself weighs 3.5kg empty. The lady tells us we have to turn around and go all the way back downstairs to where we checked in. We were already pressed for time and now were in danger of missing our flight. We go back downstairs and there is one lady covering all of the checked bags. We wait in line and she then commences to tell me they have to be below 7kg or it will cost me $200/bag. Also they need to be consistent in this policy. As the lady stopped us before customs to weigh our bag 10 people walked by with bigger bags than mine. I hope they review this policy as they are getting a lot of bad press and a lot of unhappy economy class patrons who last time I checked still represent the majority of seats on the planes!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,no

Lufthansa,2.0,H Mustafi,23rd June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Rude cabin crew and a bad experience on this short flight. We were sat at row 4 with a curtain blocking the view to the business rows. A flight attendant giving the safety briefing was standing on the front of the aircraft whom could not be seen from Row 4 (behind the curtains). She did not like when we lifted the curtain to see the safety instruction. A bit later on during the flight when they started to serve hot drinks, the flight attendant started to serve coffee. My wife asked for two milk/creamer with her coffee, she was given only one. She asked again for the second sachets as the flight attendant dismissing the request and started to walked away, she said her colleague would serve more milk (this was the first row on economy she served, so she did not run out of milk/creamers). She ignored my wife and walked away. A bit later during the flight we asked for some milk for our 2 year old son. The senior flight attendant said they don't carry milk on the aircraft. We flew with lufthansa 10 days earlier on the same type of aircraft and they had milk for a baby.

Seems 20 minutes after dropping off the rental car we get the delay notice, 1 hour, getting updates but been here for six hours now. We could have stayed in the rental and enjoyed the days, instead we are sitting with about 600 customers. The delay is due to a breakdown with the plane. I asked at the other gates that were delayed and all stated there was a concern with the plane. I guess I have no choice as I am stuck here.

We were in the first row and had a birds eye view of the flight attendant having what I will call a bad hair day. She put her long, stringy hair in bun, let it down and put it up again and so on a few times. That wasn't so bad but at least twice she ran her fingers through her hair and dropped dislodged hairs and goodness only know what else directly onto the cabin floor! I can't believe it but she did. I never saw her wash her hands and yes she served meals too. The breakfast was supposed to be eggs Benedict. Well there was no poached egg, it resembled a scrambled mishmash and the Hollandaise sauce was baked into the egg instead of being a sauce.

The trip to Singapore was ok but initially food of choice was not given to us until 30 minutes later they managed to find us the curry mutton. However the complaint I have about the flight is the return trip from Singapore stopover at Dubai to Heathrow. The first leg between Singapore and Dubai was fine. It is flight from Dubai to London on the 16th May 2015 which I am most unhappy about. At the start the flight was late. The air-conditioning was not working under the heat in Dubai. The pilot did inform us of the fault with the air-conditioning but that it would be fine once we were in the air. The flight was delayed 30 minutes and we were not given water from the flight attendants. For that reason I doubt if I will fly with Emirates again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no

United Airlines,6.0,Dewey Seid,22nd December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Having flown Business Class from Bangkok on a A380 Thai Airways to Paris to connect to United Airlines business Class to Newark, the difference was striking. The United much hyped Polaris business class product was disappointing. Unfortunately the Polaris seats and configuration is still the old narrow flat seats in the 2-4-3 configuration where all passengers don't have aisle access and window and middle seats have to ask the aisle passenger to get up. On my flight, there was a extra Polaris trainer on board for the cabin attendants but still the service was not smooth or elegant. Polaris is suppose to understand that rest and sleep is primary to the business flyer but the meal service took at least 2.5 hours with them still beginning to serve the ice cream when the lights were already dimmed. There was such a long time between courses as if the attendents didn't know what to do. I was seated next to the galley and watched them being disorganized and clumsy as the curtain was not closed. The Thai Airways personal cabin attendant knew my name as she introduced herself and all the courses, refill of drinks arrived swiftly and effortlessly like magic from behind a curtain. The cabin was always a sea of calm and tranquil unlike United noisy clatter. The one thing that was superior on United's Polaris was the cuisine. The salad was fresh and the courses plated well and restaurant quality. If only if United's Polaris could train their cabin attendants to a much higher standard of providing smooth professional service as if in a quality restaurant rather than a busy diner.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CDG to EWR,December 2016,2.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,2.0,no

Air Canada,2.0,Samy-George Salib,26th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them ""brushing"" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need ""Go to town"" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,Iain Bagwell,29th August 2015,"BHM-ATL was okay, short (25 mins) but had welcome drink and time for one in the air. Fairly tight connection in ATL, so I was last to board first class cabin. I could see all other passengers had welcome drinks, but no-one offered me one. When I asked I was told I was too late! Things got worse from there. When asked what I wanted to eat the choice was steak or lasagne. I asked what came with the steak and was asked what I meant. I said I meant what comes with the steak? Not a difficult question I thought. So the FA goes back to the galley (I could see it all happen from my seat), opens a foil tray and comes back to my seat with one word - carrots! Talk about taking care of the customers. Eventually when my food arrived, sauce had been spilled all over and somehow under the tray. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but needless to say I didn't eat it! I've seen this kind of behavior before when FA's seem to vent on a customer for unknown reasons - I guess I drew the short straw on this flight.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,Bryce Farmer,24th December 2015,"Our trip to Brussels started out in Austin, Texas with a short two hour flight to Atlanta, as per usual when flying transatlantic with Delta, you are usually directed through Atlanta, New York, or Detroit. The domestic first class seats were comfortable enough, and there was a charging port between the seats as well, however there was no inflight entertainment. We were offered snacks like peanuts, potato chips, and crackers out of a basket, and all drinks were free. However, because of the short length of the flight there was no meal service, and even some of the larger snacks like tapas were unavailable. The flight attendants were polite and nice, but they were not above and beyond, and didn't interact with the passengers more than they had to. As we were flying in the Delta One cabin international, we got free access to the Sky Club, however with so many people flying for the holidays, it was overly crowded, and a restaurant by our boarding gate was a much better option to spend our two hour layover. When the flight from Atlanta to Brussels finally boarded, we were promptly offered champagne or orange juice. There was a Westin pillow and comforter set, TUMI amenities kit with a pen, lip balm and lotion, eye mask, socks, tissues, mouthwash, and earplugs. After passengers were seated, attendants brought cashews and refilled our champagne. About an hour after take off dinner service included option of beef or cod. The inflight entertainment was rather limited with about 30 or so movies and a handful of television shows on seatback screens.

Delta Air Lines,5.0,K Sheares,3rd November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience.",Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Tampa via Atlanta,October 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,no

We paid for extra legroom, which to me makes all the difference. Was worth it. I didnâ€™t eat throughout the flight, but got plenty of water and was on the wifi the whole time which worked very well.

Out of all the airlines I have taken (and I fly to some remote places in the world) American Airlines have managed to be the most consistent with their lack of customer care and disorganization and just a huge shame to what you would expect of one of the biggest airlines coming out of the US. Canceling and delaying is something that happens so often that I have become shocked when their flights go as planned, they offer no compensation of course for those delays and time and energy consuming horrible experiences that everyone hates. American Airlines offer no canceling/bumping a flight like 90% of the time, just zero effort to even try and show just a little bit of courtesy toward the customer in general.",,Business,Economy Class,Oakland to Charlotte via Phoenix,July 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Aegean Airlines,9.0,James Cox,9th January 2016,"My family (me, wife, children ages 11 and 14) just completed a trip from Paris to Athens, Istanbul, and Cyprus with stopovers of 3-5 days in each place, six flight legs total between Dec 25 and Jan 8. Each leg was in Economy class on A320-200 aircraft. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service on all of the flights. All flights, even the short ones between Athens and Istanbul which were a little over one hour, included some sort of meal or snack service with drinks, food, and tea or coffee afterward. Although food portions were relatively small, everything tasted good. The flight crew were all polite and professional. Seats were comfortable for all flights and all planes seemed clean and well-maintained. Online checkin and baggage drop-off were straightforward and simple, and we were able to use family lanes in for baggage drop-off in Athens and Cyprus. There was no individual in-flight entertainment and we did not use Wi-Fi, but I enjoyed watching images from travel destinations in Crete and some of the Greek islands that were displayed on the overhead screens on final return flight from Athens and Paris. The rest of the time, reading and video games on our own devices during flights were fine for entertainment given that all of the flights were under 3 hours.

I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault!

This incident happened during Istanbul-Manila leg of my flight. Im not sure what happened, but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible, flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year, I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice, and went to sleep. Before landing, the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food.

Southwest Airlines,3.0,Val Wilson,15th September 2013,I recently flew to New York City and my airport was LaGuardia. The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful. I don't think I will take SW to New York especially via LaGuardia ever again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,no

However, the movies did have to be paid for but I didn't much mind as I had my kindle and 3DS. Cabin crew was also friendly.

We had to organise our new flights ourselves at some cost to us. Once on board the premier class is just like premium economy although its supposed to be the equivalent of business class.

Dis functional and impossible to use if you have an issue. It's impossible to email a representative. The list of questions they want is irrational. The site shut down and crashed on me because it wanted information I didn't have. I was unable to get information on seat upgrades. Then I called them and spent 45 minutes of my vacation on hold.

I tried to upgrade the seats then but was told I needed to wait till two days before we left) so here I am on hold for an hour two days before we leave and they tell me that they cant help me and can't do anything because the seats were booked at an undisclosed rate. They eventually helped me and scheduled a gentleman to call me. This process took 2-3 hours on the phone and a scheduled call two days later.

American Airlines,1.0,J Dlabaja,19th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I had the absolute worst experience out of the other 3 carriers I have flown before. American Airlines customer service is almost non existent and they just rip you off and not care. I had a connecting flight in Miami, FL that they scheduled for me, which boarding time was at 8:59 pm and departing time was 9:29 pm. My first flight to Miami landed on time at 9 pm, by the time I was actually off the plane (I pack very light and had one small backpack) it was about 9:07. I ran to my connecting flights gate to make sure I got there in time to check in and board to return home. When I approached the gate (at 9:15), the gate worker asked aloud if anyone was next and after I said that I was on the flight he responded very rudely ""too late, go rebook at the rebooking station"" and as he said that he printed out a boarding pass and handed it to a girl who was on stand by with her boy friend, also on stand by. So he basically did not want to undo what he had just done, which was give my seat away when I got there when I was supposed to be. The lady at the rebooking station then tried to charge me to rebook for something that was not my fault! I was stuck in Miami for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work and my classes. After contacting customer relations about the situation, they told me that it was my fault because I did not get to the gate to check in 30 minutes prior (which would have to have been 8:59 pm, when my first flight was landing). Not only that, but not once did I hear them paging me over head to ""recheck"" or for their last call. After not getting a response back for weeks I decided to call again, the customer service rep then told me that the connecting flight that they had scheduled was in reality not a legal connection because it was set to depart less than 30 minutes after I arrived, that they cannot be less than 45 minutes. Which if that were the case, I would have gotten there in their ""30 minutes policy"" time frame.

Arrived at the airport early and noticed our boarding cards had not issued seat numbers just asterisks. When we mentioned this we were then allocated seats with a new boarding card. The flight was overbooked and some people were subsequently bumped. We paid 25 dollars each way for luggage but loads of people who had brought large hand luggage were then made to check them in but for free.

Then the passenger and his wife left the plane. But the wrong luggage was taken from the plane, and another bag not belonging to anyone was shown by a steward to us all. None of the staff apologised for the delay or inconvenience. I arrived at Malpensa two hours late and very tired, having started my trip the day before in Yogyakarta.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,M Abbott,16th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Panama to Amsterdam via Atlanta, connecting to Dublin with KLM. Worst most disrespectful treatment by gate/ground staff I've ever had in a airline anywhere. Suffice it to say the following that occurred to us, a family who was on a trip that we saved thousands for with a terminally ill family member trying to make memories To have it ruined at the last minute and have bad memories of it is extremely unacceptable. First was called by Delta the partner in the flight with KLM, called and told us they were changing our flight with a 24 hr lay over ""as crew couldn't find a place to stay for the night in Panama City due to the storm"". Never mind that we looked up and found several places on the beach. In any event, this meant we would have to add another day of expense and change our flights to 5:55 AM, meaning we also lost all ability to submit our VAT refunds among other things, but the worst was yet to come. On checking in the 'lady' at the gate told us we could not carry on our policy size and weight carry on bags, as the ""flight was full"", yet the bags had important medical equipment, medicines and fragile expensive goods that we had no ability to lock up as we were told the bags would be able to be carried on. If the bags were lost or damaged replacing the equipment and meds would be extremely hard even once back home. The worst part-every other passenger behind us and at other gates for the same flight were being allowed to carry on their bags as advertised. CWhen confronted about why this was the case the gate attendant told us ""call direct if you like its in the policy fine print, we can do this to you"" She then became belligerent and gave one word answers, didnt look at us and said 'next"". When I tried to ask if wheelchair assistance had been confirmed, she spouted off a series of gate numbers where I could go ask for a wheelchair, and rushed us out of line. I then returned to the gate as her info wasn't sufficient, and asked another gate attendant who simply stuck her finger in the air and said ""over there somewhere"" and didn't even look at us. Wheelchair assistance either wasn't at the gates or was very late and we had short connect flights and couldn't just hope it showed up. My son and wife had to almost carry me at a run to the next gate. The only connection this didn't happen at was Atlanta and then only because we we hunted down a wheelchair attendant when ours wasn't there. The gate attendants were disrespectful, dismissive, and left us genuinely concerned given my inability to walk the distances due to legitimate neurological disease for which I carried medical proof- They forced us to check bags that others were carrying on board -passengers of the same ticket class as us. In fact nearly every other passenger boarding had their bags, The only difference in us and other passengers. -we had a disabled passenger. Thanks KLM for taking what should have been a good memory for our family with thousands of dollars of expense and sending my family home stressed, insulted, worried and upset.

There are so many people to cater for staff can not handle it. No pre-dinner drink offered and had to ask twice for a drink. Staff were rude and unfriendly.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Matthew Caesar,8th January 2016,"Turkish Airlines from Cairo to Amsterdam via Istanbul, and the flight itself was fine once airborne, food and entertainment were standard. But the ground operation is shambolic. Our flight leaving Cairo was delayed for one hour. I understand that this happens and little can be done about it, but once we arrived in Istanbul there was zero assistance to help people make their onward transfers. There were no staff at the arrival gate to direct passengers or offer assistance to more elderly people who couldn't run (unlike ourselves- if we hadn't sprinted we wouldn't have made the next flight). We had to push to the front of the security line, whereas many other airlines escort you to the front if the connection time is tight. Our gate had just closed when we arrived, but still made the last bus to the plane. Although the plane then sat on the runway for another hour. In short, there may as well have been no ground staff in Istanbul they did so little. This would be semi-understandable in a small provincial airport, but this is their hub! To finish everything off, our bags were lost. They were eventually delivered to us 4 days later, soaking wet. Not damp - drenched. Every item in my bag was heavy with water, as if it had been left in a thunderstorm for hours.

Ground and cabin staff were personable passed beverages 4 times on long-haul outbound but service was very lean on return (no coffee on a flight arriving at 5 am). Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway.

First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew. I got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time.

Emirates,1.0,P Pearce,18th August 2014,We flew on an Emirates ( Qantas codeshare) Sydney - Paris - Sydney. I strongly advise anyone contemplating this option to forget it. The flight goes to Bangkok where you spend 1-2 hours on the tarmac/transit lounge with the 'joys' of the dual security inspection at Bangkok airport and the usual scam of your duty free bottles etc being confiscated unless you have made the necessary arrangements before hand. Then to Dubai (another couple of hours). The total is close enough to 27 hours from Sydney to Paris. The return flight was worse. Late take off from Paris (unexplained delay nearly two hours) tushed transit in Dubai then a late take off. Then the Bangkok nonsense (and the inevitable late take off). And the food option s- if you don't eat chicken then a diet faces you. Chicken featured as one of two options on every leg every meal and complemented the chicken 'appetiser' - of course you could have chosen the Asian style fish - not an attractive dish.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,no

Qatar Airways,9.0,Attila Toth,26th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Qatar Airways from Oslo to Doha. The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping. The entertainment system could have a bigger selection of movies and the browsing the selection should be available via the main screen instead of the touch screen equipped remote control.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Kevin Young,9th January 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | Oakland to Las Vegas. Itâ€™s the worst airline Iâ€™ve flown. Iâ€™ve only departed on time approximately 50 percent of the time.

Lufthansa,10.0,Nikolaus Rieskamp,1st December 2015,"Dublin to Frankfurt with Lufthansa in Business class. You get a great product and today everything was fine. Fast lane security, access to a nice and quiet Lounge in Dublin, priority boarding, a seat in a calm cabin with two armrests for your own and plenty of space for your elbows. Perfect food and drink servce and priority delivering of the bags. The price is not low-cost, but it is worth the product you get. Weak points? The seats do not really recline, there is no WiFi and there is no inflight entertainment, but as the flight takes only some 100 minutes, it is not a problem for me.",A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,DUB to FRA,December 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Cheryl Dilbeck,20th January 2016,"I just returned from a trip where I used Turkish Airlines, flying from San Francisco to Rome via Istanbul. I left San Francisco on January 1st. Check in went fine. The flight was fine. I had a layover in Istanbul and then on to Rome. I got to Rome and had no luggage. I was told it was left in Istanbul. The form was filled out and I was told they would deliver it to me either the next day or the day after that. This made me nervous as we were leaving for a cruise 4 days after my arrival in Rome. I didn't hear anything the first day. I tried to call them all through the second day and it was constantly busy, so I emailed them. They responded and said they did not have my luggage. I emailed every day and got the same reply every day for four days until we left on the cruise. Everything I needed for that cruise was in that bag - all the formal gowns, shoes, purses, etc. Once onboard the ship, they also tried to contact Turkish Airlines, but were not given any type of response. I called the airline during the cruise. I was told my claim had been closed and that my luggage had been delivered. When I questioned them about this as I had not received my luggage, they stopped responding to me. I called again and they told me to call a different number which I did. In the end, I was told to call four different numbers before they told me to call back to the original number. Each time I was told they could not help me. When I returned to Rome 16 days later, I went to the airport to try and find my luggage. After a considerable amount of time, they found it. A bit too late, however. Not having my luggage meant my daughter and I could not attend the three formal gala nights on the ship - the thing we were most looking forward to. Although we tried not to let the situation ruin the cruise, it definitely was not the vacation we had hoped for. For my return flight, Turkish Airlines cancelled the first flight and rebooked me on a flight four hours later. They caused me to miss my connecting flight. They were not concerned about my second leg, although it was booked on their airline. When I pushed them to get me home, they ended up booking me on British Airways. When I asked about compensation for the 1500 euros I had to spend on clothes, toiletries, etc, I was told sorry, fill out a form and someone will probably get back to you. So, here I am, not getting compensation and no one will respond to my emails or talk to me in person. Save yourself a ton of heartache and use a different airline. If anyone from Turkish airlines is bothering to read this and actually wants to help, I would welcome an email from you.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to FCO via IST,January 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,8.0,Anders Pedersen,22nd July 2014,NBO-DXB-SGN on 20-21 July 2014. Travels on Boeings 777-300 and 777-200 respectively. Flights on time. Wonderful service from ground staff throughout. Smooth hotel stay (all inclusive) provided and perfectly arranged by EK in DXB due to long transfer. I was only dissatisfied in DXB with a 40 minutes bus ride from aircraft to gate in the middle of the night - unbelievable and extremely tiring. On board: FAs of superior kindness alertness and professionalism. IFE outstanding. Food: Special meal provided. Other passengers were provided with three options all of acceptable quality. Many soft drinks available. 3 options for beers but all industrial waterish and with a boring taste. Wines tolerable there were 2 red wines in mini bottles and 1 white-wine. DXB-SGN was another tiresome new bus ride for 45 Minutes (including a stop for 20 minutes standing as planes were taxiing. Economy cabin was completely full. Food even better than on the previous flight including special meal. Drinks very generous. Staff did well despite a very crowded economy cabin. Too many seats squeezed in (3-4-3 configuration) which make extremely narrow aisles which hardly can accommodate a trolley. Compared to Qatar Airways Emirates appear to be regaining the lead as (apart from DXB bus experience) they are overall more professional even to customers without status cards.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

American Airlines,6.0,J Chauhan,14th August 2016,"London Heathrow to Fresno via Dallas with American Airlines. The layover in Dallas was supposed to be about 5 hours, which is already quite long. However we ended up being there for 9 hours. The airline needed a pilot and 2 staff to fly in from Tulsa. The continuous delays on already overstressed passengers were ridiculous. We were not offered vouchers or anything else for food as we waited for 4 hours as the airline tried to pull themselves together to get the pilot and staff there. This is completely unacceptable. At the very least, some sort of voucher should have been given to cover our food and drink. I am really disappointed in American Airlines, where basic courtesy was not provided.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to FAT via DFW,August 2016,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,2.0,no

Southwest Airlines,10.0,A Bays,4th November 2016,"Baltimore to Wichita with Southwest Airlines. I purchased two tickets for two people under one reservation. I needed to change the return flight for one of these tickets without changing the flight for everyone on the reservation. Since you cannot do this online without changing the entire reservation, I was able to get my flight changed with one simple phone call that lasted all of 8 minutes including the automated menu and hold time. This change also did not cost me extra! This was a nice surprise considering is took me 6 months to get American Airlines to acknowledge that they need to reimburse me for a flight I was never on! It was pleasant calling 1 number and speaking to a person rather then calling 13 different numbers and getting the same automated message.

Air Canada,5.0,S Hauravan,25th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Saskatoon to Toronto. If you are in Canada and want to fly, you lack options! Only Air Canada and WestJet. I flew to India in April and May this year. While coming back to Canada I had my parents with me and because of their old age and my father's nerve problem in his feet, I asked for a wheelchair facility for both. They failed to provide wheelchairs both in Delhi and in Toronto. I filed a complain and after that they gave me a CAD 400 discount on my next booking. So, I booked flights for three of us to go to Toronto (return ticket). Don't take me wrong. Air Canada on international routes is pretty good. The crew are helpful and food is good. Good entertainment options! Legroom is small but its economy! However, their domestic route flights are the worst I have seen. No food or drinks offered on long haul flights (Saskatoon-Toronto takes 3.5 hours). Legroom small. Sometimes no entertainment system (Saskatoon-Vancouver/Calgary routes).

Was told by employee on the phone to buy a later in day ticket to save money and was assured multiple times that my ticket was available to be put on stand by for earlier flights. Arrived at TPA, only to be told by multiple employees that it wasnt eligible to be placed on stand by. So yes I know this is partly on myself for being ignorant enough to buy a later ticket. However, due to the dishonesty on the part of the sales representative and refusal to listen by the airport employees I missed my own grandfathers funeral. Really appreciate that AA.

United Airlines,7.0,Marcel Bogaerts,4th April 2015,BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring. I see no reason why I should not take United again.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Paul Cummins,13th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Orlando to Venice via Newark. We sat on the tarmac in Orlando for 2 hours with very little air conditioning. The delay was because of lightning and I do understand that but we were given a plastic cup of tepid water during those 2 hours. When we spoke to the flight attend to let her know we had a connecting flight in Newark to Venice (there were others on the flight who also had connecting flights overseas). When we told her she assured us that because it was another United Flight they would call ahead and let them know we would be delayed and to hold the flight. She also told us we would be arriving at the same terminal as our departure terminal C. She assured us she would allow the passengers with connecting overseas flights to disembark first. None of this happened! The fight arrived at 6:35, we arrived at terminal B, she did not get us off the flight first, and no one had called ahead to hold the flight. I have heart problems and my husband And I ran through the airport where I started to feel like I was going to have a heart attack. We managed to wave down a cart and he took us the rest of the way. We got to the terminal where our flight was leaving from at 6:45 the lady at the desk said run down and get on the flight - only to find the door had been closed. The flight departure time was 6:55! I was so worn out by this time we walked back to the front desk and she said she would call operations - they got permission to open the door and let us on. When we went to find our seats there were people sitting in them so we stood trying to see what to do. Eventually I said to a flight attendant who was ignoring the situation do you think you can help us. She came and walked us round and round to try to find seats for us. I spotted two seats across the aisle from each other and said we will take those seats. I would also like to remind you that we booked this flight and our seats in May 2016.

Emirates,9.0,Liam Moulton,6th July 2014,Flew on a round trip from Jakarta to Newcastle via Dubai. Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Philip Alphonse,5th October 2015,"Security wait times in Atlanta were 1 hour (October 3). Priority lines were empty and instead of expediting passengers with tight times, everyone was left to work through the full line.

I took another train to new flight only to find I was #4 on a full flight. Next available would be three hours later. I left and went to Southwest and bought next flight out which left 20 minutes after the standby flight. Delta service is horrific all the way through starting with gate agents, security staff (not TSA but delta gate staff - one of whom argued with me for 5 minutes on the difference between priority boarding and first.

American Airlines,1.0,Bruce Kanin,19th April 2015,"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day. We will think twice before using AA again & have spread the word wherever we can.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,7.0,W Woon,7th June 2015,"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

Only negative is that alcoholic drinks aren't served on domestic flights (even though it was 8.5hrs long). The IFE had a decent selection of Western films in English and the sound quality was very good, particularly compared to that on some of Aeroflot's other aircraft.

What I can review is the United customer service, which was terrible. After multiple delays, our 10pm flight was cancelled for maintenance. We were told to go to a customer service booth across the Newark airport at 1:00 am, but soon found that there was no one at the booth. The gate agent had just led us to a place where no one could help us. I got on the phone with a very kind customer service agent who couldn't help me - all the flights for the next two days were booked. We cancelled our trip entirely and were told that we would get a hotel voucher - but there was no one there. Instead, we ended up trying to find a hotel on our own because they said we could send a receipt in. All the hotels were booked in a 20 mile radius, so we took a lift back to my apartment in Philadelphia, which cost $150. I called the next morning and was assured I would get that money back. I submitted a form, and an agent online assured me that all I had to do was submit another form. I tried to submit that form, couldn't because I didn't have a valid ticket because I had gotten a refund, and called again a month ago - when I was again assured I would get reimbursed. It's been a month and I have heard nothing from them. If you like wasting money, having people tell you nice things with no follow through, and getting stranded in New Jersey, United is your airline.

Last week my bag was only 4 lbs overweight and I was charged the enormous amount of $200. I realise that there are reasons for charging for overweight bags, but there are plenty customers who are overweight and are not charged extra for seats and there was also lots of youngsters travelling with 2 large pieces of hand luggage struggling to carry bags along the aircraft walkway.

American Airlines,2.0,Susana Kuehne,28th September 2015,"American Airlines makes it almost impossible to speak with anyone in person, and now I know why. They do not want to be held responsible for any part of your flight experience which they did not provide well - which for me, was just about every one. The mechanics of the plane, quality of the flight attendant service, timeliness of the flight, etc. My son was smacked with the tray table from the seat in front of me repeatedly and no one cared to do anything about it. I finally just left it open so it could stop randomly falling on my infant (3 months old at the time). The flight attendant got annoyed and said I had to close it and I told her I would just as soon as she figured out how to get it to stop hurting my baby. She was rude and said she didn't know and didn't even apologize. Clearly, all they care about is taking your from Destination A to B, regardless if you get there in one piece or not. If you get on the plane, then they have done their job, according to them. Do not fly with them if time or safety are your priority.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Minneapolis,April 2015,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,L Woodfine,11th January 2015,I had to book a flight from Orlando to Manchester UK the day after Christmas for a family emergency so naturally looked for the most affordable flight which by a few dollars was AA also taking into account flight times. I have flown this route with many other airlines in the past and AA was by far my worst experience. Flight left 40 mins late but did make up the time with a tail wind so we arrived on time. Some of the cabin crew were downright surly others were very pleasant. As I can't sleep on planes I rely on watching movies to pass the time but with no in-seat screens there was nothing to watch. I will never fly AA again even if it saves me money.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Jennifer Heller,29th December 2015,"Our trip was originally scheduled for San Francisco to Dallas Fort-Worth (Flight #2417), and Dallas Fort-Worth to Piedmont (#5812) in North Carolina. Flight from SFO to DFW departed and landed with no complications. Original leave time for flight #5812 on Sunday was to depart at approximately 8:30, to land in GSO at 11:05. Our troubles began when the gate changed from B47 to B1 with no notice or confirmation. The only reason we found out was from a non-airport flight tracker web site. Waiting at B1 with the rest of the people scheduled to take the flight, our gate was then changed again, back to B47 with no confirmation or notification from the airport. At this time the gate personnel at B1 still had no idea. The only reason we found out, again was from a non-affiliate web site. After running to the gate at the other end of the airport with 5 minutes to spare, (this because the Sky Link was broken) we made it to B47. At B47 there was no Gate attendant, only a message on the screen informing us that the flight would depart at the scheduled time. As we watched the scheduled time come and go, again with no gate attendant in sight the screen changed again with a later departure time, still no gate attendant at this time. After 2 hours a non-related flight attendant traveling with our group answered the ringing phone, to inform the control center that there was no gate attendant, no pilot, no crew, and that the plane had been sitting there since when we first arrived. About 5 minutes later the supervisor showed up. She was unresponsive to anyoneâ€™s questions, and refused to talk to anyone. She got on the phone a few times, typed in the computer and we watched the departure time change again. Only this time is was changed to 11:00, which was the same time as another scheduled flight. These people were also now at the gate and as confused as we were (because the airport flight screens said both our flights would be leaving at the same time, from the same gate). We finally got word that we were waiting on a crew, and we watched a pilot and two stewardesses board the plane. Again, no notice from any gate personnel. After we watched the now changed 11:30 departure time come and go, we watched the pilot and two stewardesses deboard the plane. Still no one at our gate to answer any questions, as the supervisor had left hours before. We asked the pilot and stewardesses what was happening and they responded that they had been sitting on the plane for too long, and were now over their hours. They also informed us once they walked away there was no one to fill their spots, and the flight would inevitably be cancelled. Again no notice from the screen that still said it was departing at 11:30, which at this time it was 12:30. I called, and they rebooked us to fly out Monday, from Dallas to Ft. Meyers, to Charlotte, then Greensboro. The woman on the phone then told me that she could not give vouchers for hotels over the phone",,,,,,,,,,,,

The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find â€“ I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge. Now that Qatar have joined One World I may change to Finnair as their prices and travel times are better than Qatar. All in all Qatar is a good product.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

Southwest Airlines,7.0,R Moore,20th March 2015,I have been traveling business select with Southwest twice a month for the past 3 years. I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,yes
American Airlines,7.0,G Harris,27th October 2015,"Because I am used to economy airlines, riding American was a change. While the flight on the CRJ-200 was operated by Air Wisconsin under the US Airways Express tag, the parent was still American. Overall the flight attendants were polite and attentive. I asked one of the stewardess (737-800 flight from DCA to ORD) how her day was going and how many flights she had today. She replied with her answer, then gave me a an entire can of Coca-Cola. Surprising considering that they aren't supposed to do that. Though $25 each way for a bag is excessive, it does beat the economy airlines. Their airfare is high, but because this was school sponsored, I only had to pay for the bags.

Lufthansa,9.0,C Rief,21st August 2015,"Everything went well and flights were all on time. On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic. I must also say pay for the seat selection. It's worth it if the flight is oversold.

Air Canada B787s are quite basic in comparison to their older planes (B763, B744) that I've been on and I actually like the interior of the A321 more during our journey. The 788 seats were quite narrow and hard and overall, passable in terms of comfort. The plane's interior looked ""tired"". Food was served fast but was not properly heated as our water and salad were frozen and not consumable. IFE was decent but did not like the fact that the remote was very small and could not be extended, thank goodness it was also touch screen though. Only plus for AC for NRT-YVR was the ground staff and cabin crew who were all helpful and friendly. As for the YVR-YOW leg, enjoyed the flight as we found the Bus to be much more comfortable than the 788. IFE was more user-friendly and of better quality. Cabin crew were professional and friendly.

Finally, when the â€œother end of the counterâ€ was free I moved over to it. The clerk told me she couldnâ€™t help me and directed me back to the counter I had just moved from. I told her it was time American Airlines got their act together as â€œheâ€ had just directed me to her counter for service. By then I was incensed but, moved back to the other line yet again.

American Airlines,9.0,B Stewart,9th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I've had my share of bad experiences with American Airlines including permanently lost luggage, misconnects, delays and rude customer service on the ground and in the air. Iâ€™ve tended to avoid them except for domestic US travel so approached this HKG-LAX flight with trepidation. The key attraction was a business class fare significantly lower than any other direct service on the route (and even cheaper than one-stops via Seoul or Taipei). Perhaps I was very impressed because my expectations were set so low. This was a very good flight. Same J class seat as CX, except AA provided a mattress and pyjamas. They served plated food of decent quality and quantity, had a decent wine list and a provided a wide selection of programming on the IFE so delivered on everything you should expect from a world class premium airline. Ultimately what made this flight very good was the crew. They appeared to be enjoying their jobs â€“ lots of smiles and proactive interaction with the passengers. I could not fault any aspect of the service. Iâ€™m now willing to consider American Airlines for long haul business class travel if this is the level of service they can deliver consistently. Well done American.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,HKG to LAX,November 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Seat belts are a bit short and offer very limited extension capabilities. Entertainment system is awesome and so is the ""OnAir"" Internet. Good meals. It would be nice if coffee and tea could be offered at the same time they bring the meals. Not sure that the space reserved for the bar/entertainment area is really the best use of that space.

Air Canada,1.0,Josh Banman,19th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Puerto Vallarta to Kelowna via Vancouver. Flight to Puerto Vallarta was good, staff awesome and service was prompt. Unfortunately on the way home I can't say the same. We checked in early and selected our seats to ensure a window and isle seat and to avoid the long lines at the airport waiting for check in. Once we arrived at the airport we waited 3rd in line for over an hour watching everyone who was checking in at the airport go through infront of us due to a computer issue. Then we were told that the flight was full and we had to sit in the middle despite checking in 24 hours before. Once in the plane the AC unit went down and we sat on the runway inside the boiling hot plan for an hour while crews scrambled to fix the issue. So we take off and I'm excited to get water after waiting in a hot plane for an hour only to wait 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight to even speak to a flight attendant. When I asked why things were so slow they scoffed at me and blamed the airline for cutting down from 7-6 flight attendants for this flight. Now I understand this can be stressful for them and create more work, but where I'm confused is how come on the way down with 6 flight attendants I received awesome service and water and coffee several times? I wish it could stop there but unfortunately it doesn't, we had to catch a connecting flight wich was overbooked, and we were asked if anyone would like to stay behind in Vancouver, only to find out it was so two Air Canada employees could fly home. Once our connecting flight to Kelowna landed at 12am our little plane of 30 had to sit on the runway for an hour while the other 2 international planes of over 150 passengers unloaded. Super disappointed in Air Canada and will definitely choose WestJet when flying next time.

I will spare you all of the details of our first and last flight with American Airlines but will instead surmise. Arrive at Miami Intl after a fantastic vacation on a cruise and then at Four Seasons in Miami having travelled to Miami with BA. Check in at Miami. We had 3 bag to check one of which was 2kg overweight but the other 2 bags were significantly under. With any other airline no problem. With American Airlines a major problem which ended up with my wife and I having to open our bags in front of a line and carry a bag of dirty laundry for 14 hours Miami to NewYork on a very very old 767 with the smallest seats ever. Service on board dreadful. Interesting arrival at JFK with a ""go around"" on final? Now the worst - a transatlantic 7 hour flight on a 26 year old Boeing 757-200. Configured with 12 business class and the rest the lowest form of economy class we have ever experienced. Drinks service finally offered after 2.5 hours of the flight. The cabin team just were not interested. One of them during drinks service walked down the aisle with a large plastic bag of pretzel packets and literally threw them at us. They had a total of 6 cans of beer on the trolley? Food after 3.5 hours completely inedible and cold. The announcement of breakfast had everybody in fear.

The suitcase was broken and items within the toilet bag were broken, I raised a second claim and the company has been just playing with my team, making me loss my time, with different bureaucracy papers waiting for me to get tired of them.

American Airlines,1.0,Terry Gilliam,11th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Jacksonville to New York via Charlotte. Sleeping at CLT: How a flight crew laid waste our $4105.29 AA Vacation family weekend in New York. First, when I wrote my review of our AA Vacations Westin La Paloma trip in April, I didn't think that experience could be worsted (opposite of bested), so I didn't expect to be writing about another superlatively bad AA Vacation again, at least not so soon. I was wrong. The moral of this story is if you value the welfare of your family, your time and your money, don't rely on AA Vacations. But I've gotten ahead of myself. Here's our story. Things went beautifully on the first leg of what was to have been a fun family weekend in NY to celebrate the end of our son's school year. We sped through TSA pre, were greeted courteously at the gate and took our assigned seats in first class on AA1937. After a pleasant short flight to Charlotte, we connected to AA1981 bound for LaGuardia. When that flight didn't push away on time, the captain announced from the flight deck that a ""minor technical issue"" would hold us up briefly. I followed a running text stream of delay notices from AA on my phone. Then I received the dreaded notice of cancellation. Oddly, the flight crew were still telling us that the â€œtechnical issueâ€ was in the process of being fixed. Specifically, the pilot advised that the copilot had flown too many hours to legally make the trip to NY and AA was on the hunt for a replacement. When I told the cabin attendant that the flight had been cancelled, she passed the news to the captain who, nonplussed, announced that ""apparently American Airlines notifies passengers of cancellations before telling its crew."" We were advised to deplane and come back at 7:00 a.m. the following day. I immediately called AA Vacations who had booked as part of our package non-refundable tickets for activities and events on Saturday. I got a terrific agent named Kristen who nimbly booked us on a flight to Newark. She even kept our first-class status! All we had to do was run the mile from the end of terminal C to the end of terminal B before the flight's scheduled 10:00 departure. We needn't have run. The flight to Newark was delayed due to a mechanical. First 11:00, then 12:00, then vouchers to Starbucks, then 1:00, then first class boarded, then we were told to deplane, then 2:00",,,,,,,,,,,,

At all flights informative announcement from cabin. Toilets on LH can inconsistent dirty on some segments. On both flights to RIX crew ran out of sandwiches so we had to take leftover croissants. The crew are doing an acceptable job but they need to work on their snack service. This segment is 2 hours and has enough time to serve a decent snack and please also consider vegetarians. Even though I pay for a premium airline I always have to buy a salad or sandwich from the airport to eat inside the aircraft just because sandwiches are either with chicken or eggs.

The decline of this once great airline is quite sad, but airline choices in the USA generally are limited. I used a combination of reward miles and revenue ticket, and requested a simple upgrade to domestic US First Class, using AAdvantage miles. They finally granted an upgrade, but only on the short COS-SNA sector, not the longer DFW-SNA sector. However, predictably American billed for the entire sector, and also had the temerity to bill a further $150.00 for same day flight change, and the upgrade. I couldn't believe it! Not only is the service on this airline non-existent, but they bill additional charges for almost everything. It is a wonder they don't bill for breathing on the airplane, or using the bathroom.

Asked for a second meal which was provided after 5 minutes. The luggage collection landing in Heathrow was too slow and took forever. Despite these small issues Aegean Airlines is an airline that I enjoy flying with and the best choice by far out of Athens.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Aly Schilperoort,18th August 2015,"My family and I were getting ready to fly to Hawaii on a family vacation. Due to mileage reasons, we had to fly Delta though we usually fly Alaska. When we arrived at the airport and checked in at the Delta front desk to check our bags, they're seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding our 3 hour layover in San Jose. However, the lady at the desk assured us that everything was cleared up and our bags would make it on the plane with us. After a 3 hour flight delay and having to get off the plane because a flight attendant got injured, we finally took off, barely making our connecting flight in San Jose (we landed at 6.10, got off at 6.20 and our flight was taking off at 6.35). We had to sprint to our connecting flight. After arriving in Hawaii, our bags never arrived at baggage claim. We weren't too concerned at first, thinking that the bags probably just didn't make our connecting flight in San Jose but would be sent over shortly after. After waiting for the next flight arriving from Seattle to see if our bags came on that flight, they never did. Long story short, we ended up never getting our bags until 4 days after arriving in Hawaii. The whole thing was an absolute nightmare and my family and I will never be flying Delta again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Hawaii,August 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Joel Henderson,28th August 2014,"My two children and I had a flight booked from Albany to Portland Oregon changing planes in Newark and Houston. I received my first delay notice via email at 10.16 due to late inbound aircraft arrival. The second one came at 4.39 pm while we were at Newark Airport due to same reason however my children and I watched the plane arrive. The plane had tons of cargo underneath. Not just baggage but tons of commercial boxes. Our plane which was originally supposed to take off at 5pm for Houston did not take off until almost 7pm which put us in Houston at 9.30 a half hour after our plane left for Portland. That was just the beginning of our frustration. As I got to the gate and went to ask the United Airline attendant about connections she said ""see the guy down there and he will help you with connecting flight."" She was just telling us what we needed to hear to get us out of her way. By the time I got to customer service at 9.45 United Airlines customer service workers were dropping like flies among a mob of very unhappy people. We are talking 10pm people at one of America's busiest airports. 10.30 I finally get with a customer service worker who gets me food voucher's taxi voucher's and a hotel voucher for a best western 25 minutes away from the airport. She said ""grab some food around the corner"". All food venues were closed. We walked down to ground transportation and were informed only yellow cabs accept taxi voucher's. Finally got a cab and made it to the hotel at 11.30. In short lies and terrible customer service. The cargo was more important than the passengers and the customer service was horrible. I guess I'll never fly United again and given the amount I travel that's a loss for them.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Air Canada,9.0,Stephen Brunette,10th September 2013,ADB-IST-YYZ-YUL return in economy on 14 August. First flight on Turkish from Izmir code share. Even though a code share flight they couldn't give me my AC boarding passes and told me my luggage would go through to Montreal but I had to check in at AC in Istanbul. Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices. Bags didn't make it to YYZ Turkish Airlines fault but AC was very good about getting them to me in Ottawa to my hotel 2 days later. Transfer to YUL smooth good short flight. Return flights again on AC from YUL-YYZ-IST on 23 Aug very good great service by caring crew as outbound. Equipment change again in IST to ADB on THY code share seat changed. Flight short and ok. Overall Air Canada has a great product as I have flown this route over the last 10 years using Turkish Airlines Air France KLM and Lufthansa. The price I paid was cheaper then the rest the flight attendants are what made the difference so nice and accommodating as well as good food for economy. I will keep using AC now that they are flight to IST from Canada.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Alitalia,2.0,Peter Lapham,6th November 2018,"Not Verified | At Milan Linate they always put you on a bus to the aircraft which therefore defeats any priority boarding advantage since everybody is lumped together. Once the doors of the bus open it is survival of the fittest with a stampede of people to the stairs of the aircraft to see who can get on-board first. Once onboard, the stewardess insisted I put my carry-on on a different overhead locker since the one directly above my seat was partly in business class which was only had 2/3 of the seats occupied (middle seat deliberately not used) - never encountered such an issue before in 20 plus years of flying. Other people also having to deal with the ""difficult"" stewardess resulting in further delays to a flight that already had been delayed by 30 mins. This resulted in the captain actually coming out to speak to the Alitalia staff to tell them to hurry up with completing the boarding. Once seated, very little legroom.

After boarding our flight in Toronto and sitting on the runway for over an hour we were told we must leave the plane as it isnâ€™t safe to fly. We were then told we would have to wait another 2 and a half hours until our next flight, ruining our dinner and holiday plans for the evening. After being told we would be leaving at 530 for sure from Pearson I was again frustrated to find we werenâ€™t even boarding until 530, and then got to sit yet again on the runway for over an hour while the flight crew figured everything out. This entire experience was very frustrating, a terrible way to start a holiday and was made worse by the lack of compensation for our time and frustration by Air Canada, no food vouchers, or drinks were offered and nothing more than an explanation every 45 minutes was given.

Since then, quality has severely declined. The aircraft for this flight was - according to the attendant - 15 days old. They attendants didnâ€™t know how to use the seats. The seats themselves we not much wider than economy class. Though they were lie-flat seats, the seats were â€œcuppedâ€ so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. The flight attendants didnâ€™t offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. For business class, this is completely unacceptable. I had to ask several times just for water.

Lufthansa,8.0,Stefan Oelze,17th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,4.0,5.0,2.0,,2.0,3.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,G Venn,13th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Las Vegas to Oklahoma via Denver. I recently flew with United to Oklahoma to visit relatives, in May. When we did our self check in. We all had separate seats even my 3yr old daughter! I went to ask for assistance and was given the ""we can't assist you with your seats, then she points to the sign ""bag drop off only"". She then said go sort yourself out at the gate. we got to the gate, and waited for someone to assist us at the service desk. When someone finally appeared. We asked if they could help us with the seating arrangements, because how could they seat a child on their own. We were told they couldn't help with seating arrangements we needed to go to the ticketing desk, which was on the other side of the terminal! we were told we can go ask people to move so we could sit next to my daughter. Frustrating! Then before boarding we were stopped by the gate boarding attendant and was told we had too many bags! We are allowed two bags per person. There was four of us, we had seven bags. She made my mum ruffle around to consolidate our bags, but I told the attendant that my daughter is a person and we paid full price for her, She (my daughter) is allowed two bags! 2x4=8! The attendant then looked at me blankly and just let us through not even apologising for her mistake! Rude! A week later my parents return trip from Oklahoma was booked with United airlines. When they got there (their English is limited) they asked for assistance with the self check in. The two ladies that went to help them, told my parents they had too many bags. Again! My mum had two bags, dad the same. Mum was holding her jacket and a travel pillow for the flight. They bullied my parents to the point, that my mum said she didn't want any more hassle and was happy to pay for the baggage fee. My mum had only cash, but they told my mum they don't accept cash, only credit card! By this time it was almost boarding time for them, then a supervisor of the airline came to see what was the fuss, the supervisor told my parents that they can go because they have the correct amount of bags - just plain rudeness!

Aeromexico,5.0,M Chavez,5th October 2014,I was pretty excited to once again fly the Dreamliner especially on the direct NRT-MEX in Biz. The cabin itself is nothing out of the ordinary for business class. It is a 2-2-2 configuration typical on 787s. Enough room to stretch out and sleep if needed. What disappointed me though was the service. You would expect for paying what I paid for that seat they would have been more attentive. The only times the flight attendants came around to attend to us was when serving dinner serving breakfast and once to bring us a bottle of water. Other than that they stayed in their areas chatting the entire flight. I was traveling with a family member and we stood up to stretch and order a beer. Well after they had served us each two they said they were out of beers. Really? Overall the only thing this flight had going for it is that it is the Dreamliner and it is direct from NRT to MEX. if you don't mind a stopover I recommend flying to SAN on JAL's Dreamliner and transferring there or maybe to LAX on SQ's 380 and transferring there.

I arrived at Tokyo Haneda 6 hours prior to departure due to a domestic flight, but I couldn't check my bags in until 2 hours prior. Japan Airlines handle Qatar Airways at HND, and their check in desks are always open, so I don't know why they can't take their partners bags early. It was also disappointing that Premium Class pax can't use the fast rack security lanes here. But you do get access to Japan Airlines First/Premium Sakura lounge, which has all the facilities you need. Boeing 787 left a few mins late, and once airborne I was asleep on the very comfortable lie flat seat. When I woke up I dined (on demand) on good quality Japanese and Western food, and then rested for the rest of this 12 hour sector. Transfer at DOH was slightly less chaotic than outbound, but it is noticeable that the volume of transfer pax has not been well planned for and security is somewhat lax to get pax through quickly. Signage in DOH is poor, and I struggled to find my way to the Business lounge. Boarding the A380 was a treat (my first time) - we were warmly welcomed by a charming FA who took our coats and offered us a drink. I cannot believe how quiet the A380 is, especially on take-off. We had a great flight, enjoying the lounge bar for a cocktail before lunch, having a nap in the great seats (same as 787) and watching the IFE, A top class journey!

Jetblue Airways,10.0,C Samuel,3rd November 2014,Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience. We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out. We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience. Book early for extreme good value and highly recommend the Mint class to anyone looking for a fantastic First class experience at an affordable price.,,,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,8.0,E Simon,26th March 2015,BOS-LAX 738. Boarding was fairly efficient. They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,yes
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,M Jalena,24th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | This was a Delta flight operated by KLM. I upgraded to business from economy for around $500 at the gate. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the equipment had been changed from a Boeing 787 to a 777 however I was looking forward to the KLM business experience. If you have Air France points always ask because the original price to upgrade was around $900 however just for being a member of the Air France loyalty program, the price dropped down to a little bit under $500 and I did not have to use points. Keep in mind you have to ask and hopefully find an agent that is nice enough to do it for you. Upon boarding, it was obvious that the 777 was old however it was well-kept. The bathroom was very nice and had Dutch themed wallpaper with all kinds of amenities inside. They serve you a hot meal that includes an appetizer, entrÃ©e, and everything you can drink every two hours. They use beautiful china, glass, nice silverware, and beautiful linen napkins. Two hours before landing they serve you a hot breakfast. They also give you a nice little Dutch themed ceramic house with liquor inside as a gift which I thought was a lovely touch and your choice of chocolate. The seat was large, very comfortable, and with plenty of storage. The amenity kit however was quite basic. It included a pair of poorly made socks, something to cover your eyes that resembled a mask, earplugs, only flimsy toothbrush with a tiny bit of toothpaste, all inside a cheap looking zipper bag that looked like a coin purse. Needless to say after using a few items inside I left it on board. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment options were decent for a 7 hour flight.

Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,4.0,Rachelle Saker,8th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. We were looking forward to flying with Emirates - we hadn't flown with them before and had heard good things. But unfortunately the customer service (or lack thereof) from the Flight Attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. I have written over a month ago to the Emirates Feedback form on their website but have not had any response - perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints? For a start, none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I realised how uncomfortable I felt with the sour faces around me. About an hour into the flight I thought I would use the restroom. I was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat, row 56. I had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so I walked forward too, where I could see the toilet sign. A male flight attendant asked me where I was going? I said, ""To the toilet. I'm going to the restroom."" He shouted, ""Back! Get back. Go back!"" and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. I was shocked at his attitude and aggression that I returned to my seat. He came over to me and said, ""You can use the toilet at the back of the plane."" I explained that I had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that I felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. He said I could use the toilet towards the front if I wanted. I have no idea how many international and domestic flights I have been on in my 48 years, but I have never been spoken to like that - with so little provocation! The other flight attendants were equally rude",,,,,,,,,,,,

Emirates,3.0,J Wells,27th July 2014,EK161 DXB to DUB on 16 July and EK384 DXB to BKK on 17 June. We still look forward to a decent experience on Emirates that I have read about here on airlinequality.com. Interestingly people I have recently spoken to have also shared negative experiences on Emirates - I guess we have just been unlucky. Inconsistency is clearly a problem. Some of our sectors were on Qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on Qantas and they were also more family friendly than Emirates. Ultimately we don't have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but Emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water. I travel on a variety of airlines for work and the Emirates service was similar to that of a very bad US airline. Anyway we arrived intact with all luggage accounted for so not all bad. Would avoid if possible in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,2.0,no
American Airlines,1.0,April Ford,26th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Greenville to Denver via Charlotte. First leg was delayed. Second leg the plane broke down so we couldn't board. They told us they were ""trying to find another plane"". At this point I'm concerned. Told us later they'd had ongoing trouble with first plane, but had only now decided to pull it for maintenance. While they searched for a plane I chatted with another customer who flies AA several times a month, she informed me it's actually rare when a flight they've sold tickets for is not missing either the plane or the flight crew, and that AA is always understaffed. They finally get us boarded, but we're severely delayed. We arrive at Denver, and find out that another delayed AA flight is parked at our gate and DEN doesn't have a spare gate to give to an airline that can't get any of its flights in and out on time. We end up sitting on the tarmac for 30-45 minutes waiting for the other plane to leave. End up getting off the plane an hour and a half late. They also apparently didn't update the status of the plane on the web, because my ride checked the delay time before coming to get me, and still had to sit around for an hour.

Aeromexico,7.0,G Davies,6th November 2015,"Easy check-in, nice lounge, fine service, was out of T2 in Mexico city within 10 minutes of landing which was great! The problem with Aeromexico is the inconsistency of the flying experience. Sometimes staff are friendly and sometimes just plain rude. Some planes have great tv entertainment and others still have overhead cabin screens with vhs video that is terrible. The worse part is the reliability of Aeromexico flights which often arrive late into Mexico city and is always blamed on too much traffic. Then do something about it! I struggle how the airline can call itself a full service airline when it discriminates against vegetarian passengers- you can never place a special meal request when purchasing your ticket but you have to remember to phone and make a special request. With every other global airline, requesting a special meal isnt a problem but with Aeromexico, on shorter flights its even worse. There is a ham and cheese sandwich or nothing! Why can't the airline simply offer a cheese sandwich to all and stop discriminating? Aeromexico is better than its competition",,,,,,,,,,,,
American Airlines,1.0,Sean Iannarone,10th October 2015,I spent almost 2-3 hours of my vacation on hold. When we landed I was told to call American Airlines two days before we left to change seats if they were available. I was told I could do it online. There website is a nightmare. Dis functional and impossible to use if you have an issue. It's impossible to email a representative. The list of questions they want is irrational. The site shut down and crashed on me because it wanted information I didn't have. I was unable to get information on seat upgrades. Then I called them and spent 45 minutes of my vacation on hold. Only to find out that.(this was on top of the 45 minutes I spent when we landed. I tried to upgrade the seats then but was told I needed to wait till two days before we left) so here I am on hold for an hour two days before we leave and they tell me that they cant help me and can't do anything because the seats were booked at an undisclosed rate. They eventually helped me and scheduled a gentleman to call me. This process took 2-3 hours on the phone and a scheduled call two days later. Unfortunately it's impossible for me to get through to that guy from Ireland. The level of disgust I have is beyond words to describe and all I was trying to do is pay them to upgrade a seat to business class?,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DUB to JFK,October 2015,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,M Garten,18th February 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | As with all budget airlines the staff treat customers poorly. This was disgusting from the booking process. I am a high status star alliance member. But get treated poorly from beginning to end. Their website is a broken mess. I was absolutely unable to make the booking on the website. So I ring in. The price immediately goes up. They force me to do a currency conversion. But then just up the price. And charge me in USD at a higher price. Then I have to pay international fees anyway. But they don't charge me once. 8 times on this one flight I have now had. And the person messes up the booking so bad I have had to make many many phone calls to try fix it. I almost missed the flight because of incompetence of the check in staff. And again I am high status star alliance. So was at the premium check in desk. Came within minutes of missing the flight because of staff incompetence. Didn't get lounge access. Gate staff were surly and uncommunicative. I was trying to find out when the flight would actually take off. To go buy food or visit the toilet. Absolutely unsuccessful. Not bording star alliance customers with United star alliance customers. Entertainment system was broken. Power plug was broken. I paid extra for this SMH charging for services and not rendering. The flight was so late I almost missed my connection. There was absolutely no support from staff to assist me getting to my next flight. Missed the lounge again Same issues at gate. Staff just don't care. With the previous issues I had really hoped to go buy some food and visit a toilet. All of this was quite a way to go. So I sat at the gate. Broken seat. Extremely uncomfortable seat. Broken entertainment. The food. If you could call it that. Was disgusting. It really is the worst food I have seen on international flight. Couldn't even get a snack.

United Airlines,1.0,C Perez,16th March 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Seattle to Albuquerque. I have not flown United Airlines in years. Decided to give them a chance as I found a cheap ticket. Flight was late taking off for no reason they could give us. We sat on the plane ready for take off an hour before leaving but they assured all of us going to ABQ would make our connecting flight. We landed get to the gate in SFO and they had just shut the door. There was 8 of us who they would not let on. When I called into customer care they would get us there till almost 24 hours later with a flight that would have another connection so who knows if we would have made that. I asked if there was a fight I could get on with another airline that would get me there that night as I needed to be. She looked and said no. I found one on AK Airlines and she said she couldnâ€™t book with them only American. I asked about getting a reimbursement on my ticket with United and she said as long as I didnâ€™t get on the next flight with them. Was on the phone waiting to talk to manager and I got hung up on. I purchase ticket with AK Airlines that can get me there that day. Call back as Iâ€™m walking to their gates. He only refunded me half the ticket since I used the other half. Stated I would have to email a complaint to get other part of ticket back. Well after months of emails and calling I have not received the other half back or anything towards that AK Airlines ticket. They say there is nothing they can do. All I was asking for was $35 dollars! Plus when I got to the AK Airlines gate United had put one lady on that flight so they could have done it. Long story short horrible customer service with no results except a $50 off my next flight with them.

Flight coming back was a nightmare. They delayed our flight for no real reason (weather was perfect, plane was there and fine ... we asked multiple people and nobody had an answer). We then waiting on the tarmac for 1/2 hour .... right in front of an open gate. No reason. Because of these errors on their part, we missed our connecting flight in Mexico City. Customer service was awful. Iâ€™ve never been treating so poorly and it was their fault we were in this inconvenient situation. Their best flight they could do for us was the next day - 20 hours out. We asked about different airlines, different airports to fly into, or at least accommodation for our family (a baby and 2 other small children) to go to. They just kept shaking their head no. It was horrible, and we had no choice but to take our exhausted babies to a hotel and feed them and let them rest for the night. All hotels within a 1/2 hour hour radius are well over $300. And we were not even close to being the only ones who missed flights due to their errors and their claims they had nothing until the following day (even tho this was at noon). It made me wonder if they were in on it with the hotels and purposely doing this to their customers. They made us miss obligations back home, they turned a hard 6 hour travel day with little kids into a 26 hour travel day, and we are out over $400 for their short comings and inconvenience they brought onto us. And they refuse to reimburse or try to make any of it up to us. They are just awful!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to MazatlÃ¡n via Mexico City,October 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,C Sarmina,25th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | La Guardia to Cozumel via Miami. Where do I begin on what turned into the worst 'first class' experience I have ever had! The first flight we were meet with the least impressive first-class seat, which belonged in a premium economy cabin somewhere. I must have missed the memo that American was now selling budget fist class. On this flight the toilet leaked blue goo all over the floor and ruined my partner's shoe when he was the first to discover this. The flight attendants were blasÃ© and showed no empathy or compassion for the situation. Our second flight on the itinerary into Cozumel was thank goodness the one uneventful leg of the journey. Fast forward through a few days in Cozumel to our return flight 1256. You allowed us to leave Cozumel without begin able to land in DFW. Flight cancellation after cancellation lead to us being left on the tarmac in San Antonio for hours. We were then taken off the plane to clear customs and abandoned in San Antonio. No communication attempts were made except emails saying I had been rescheduled on flights, moved to a lower class of service and then those were cancelled as well. I was willing to take my chances that Houston would be a better bet given weather and we had to rent a car to get us to Houston to attempt to get home to SFO in a reasonable amount of time. I am unsure why we left Cozumel when you could not get us to the destination city. I find it irresponsible to have taken all of these passengers when the pilot told us from the get go we would need to circle around Dallas- ie we couldnâ€™t land there.

Since I had to be back in Sao Paulo on the 15th in the afternoon I contacted Aeromexico in Brazil to request that my return flight be transferred to TAM who code share with Aeromexico on this segment with the flight leaving Mexico City around 20.00. Aeromexico told me that the notification must be a mistake because they see no changes in their system and all flights are according to original reservation. As proof they even sent me a copy of electronic ticket which really showed all the correct departure times. Also checking the Aeromexico site there was no indication of any delay. So I forgot all about it until one day before my return flight when I got a Trip Reminder e-mail stating again that the return flight was now at 08:40 on the 15th instead of 23:15 of the 14th.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Penola Greg,23rd April 2014,Travelled ESB-IST-LHR and return 2/4/14 and 7/4/14. Both sets of flights and aircraft were satisfactory. Flight between Ankara and Istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences. Sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal. London flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight. Selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because I was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft. It was beef or nothing. Connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating Ataturk airport customs is a long process. The most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules. Many passengers on Turkish Airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers. This occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didn't say a thing on all occasions. This is a very different attitude compared with other airlines. The command of English of the cabin crew and at times the pilots is quite poor also which is surprising for a growing international airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

I am in the customer service industry and I was honestly completely shocked at how rude, short and unprofessional 3 different phone reps were in the last few days as I made different reservations. It is unbelievable to me how badly I was talked to when making simple reservations with no questions or issues. The representatives sounded angry, annoyed and incredibly arrogant. I heard heavy sighs (when I asked one to repeat herself because she talked so fast I missed the record locator number), voices raised in anger (when I asked if I could receive a seat assignment). I am not joking when I say I was a very easy customer. I can't imagine what would happen if they were presented with an actual challenging itinerary or challenging customer. I think American Airlines needs to invest in some quality training for their phone reps. It is appalling and you are losing customers left and right because of this.",,Business,Economy Class,PHL to MIA,August 2016,1.0,1.0,,,4.0,1.0,no

Check in was fine and like our outbound flights our Oneworld ruby status was honoured and despite travelling in economy we checked in at the business class desk. On board this aircraft the legroom was really tight and I'm glad we only had less than a one hour flight. This Al Maha configuration has no seat back IFE, but this was not a problem as the flight was so short. We were served a savoury pastry and cake and a cuplet of orange juice. We arrived at Hamad International a few minutes early and the transfer process was quick and slick. Handbaggage X-Ray and personal metal detector screening. Relaxing time back in the departure lounge. Boarding was stress free as they do it by seating zone for economy. The seat was comfortable on the Boeing 777-300 and legroom more than adequate for a 7 hour flight. In common with my outbound flight the service was slow, over an hour before any service (we were in the third row of economy cabin). Dinner was nice, but entree portions are small. Drinks only served with dinner. After this you could get more drinks if you asked but the crew were not proactive offering anything other than occasional glasses of water or orange juice. Close to arrival a savoury pastry and cake accompanied by orange juice were served.

Just wanted to say that flight attendants not to be so rude when asking passengers about the emergency exits/whether they are comfortable or not. I was extremely uncomfortable sitting by emergency exit because I rarely fly and I didn't know what it entails. I was about to ask if I could switch but the woman spoke to me as though I was a complete idiot. I only chose this seat because it was one of 2 seats available. It was pretty awful to be publicly embarrassed because I was unfamiliar with the procedure. When I nervously stuttered that I didn't know what it meant she said, ""You know it's a responsibility to sit here, right? Maybe you should have a look at the pamphlet and familiarize yourself."" She didn't offer me another seat, she disdainfully informed me that I would ""have to be moved if I couldn't assist."" The gentleman next to me took pity on me and explained. Why would they go around asking if we're ok with sitting here/if we have any questions if they don't care if we're ok with it and are unwilling to explain?

Emirates,9.0,Tamim Faisal,29th January 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Had a really good experience flying with Emirates from Bengaluru to Dammam via Dubai. Both flights were on time. The aircraft used on the BLR-DXB sector was a bit old. The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful.

Cabin crew was professional and cheery, refilled my wines and offered me to try their other wines which I thought was a nice touch. Qatar Airways offer Dine on demand for premium cabin passengers. As this was a late night flight only light meals and breakfast were served but they were reasonably nice. Transfer at Doha was seamless and the lounge was huge and airy, quite crowded but had quiet corners to rest alone. The second leg departing Doha was not as good as the first leg. Boarding chaotic, service was still fair but cabin crew seemed robotic and a little disinterested. I ordered lamb as main and it was a little overcooked. Arrived Montreal on time. The seat was very spacious and easy to sleep in, but 2-2-2 seating meant that passengers in window seat had to cross over their neighbors to get out.

United Airlines,1.0,A Davidson,20th February 2014,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Ivan Nikitin,27th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Moscow Vnukovo to Istanbul return in economy. Online service was a nightmare, the website is not loading properly, aircraft maps were screwed up, which made it impossible to order the seats you want. On the way to Istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology. The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight. Personal screens are great, but I found the quality of programming and translation to Russian is poor. Meal service was good, with a choice of alcohol, metal cutlery. The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies. The flight was uneventful, but the ground staff attitude to the passengers, and inability to solve problems created by Turkish Airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly Turkish Airlines ever again.",A321 / Boeing 737-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,VKO to IST,February 2017,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

Alitalia,5.0,Michael Bragg,6th July 2014,It pains me not to give Alitalia a high mark. Their inflight experience in Business Class is impressive. But it's everything leading up to the flight that is a disaster. Their website is outdated and nearly impossible to use. Their call center is a joke with incompetent agents who read off a script. And Alitalia will change flight times on a whim and penalize the traveler financially. In our experience after paying over $8000 for a ticket they charged an additional $850 for change fee and $1500 for fare difference when I asked for an earlier flight after they changed flight times from the original booking and shortened my connection time in Rome. They also changed my booking from Business to Economy and I had to make innumerable calls to their idiotic call center to try and resolve it. Once in the air the service was lovely from a friendly sharp-looking crew. The food is a showcase of the best of Italy with delicious pastas and breads served course-by-course. I don't drink but the wine list was extensive. They provide a high-end Ferragamo amenity kit. And the seats are lie-flat and great for a long sleep. The only drawback from the inflight experience is a poor IFE system with limited options and a dirty Business Class bathroom. If Alitalia can get their act together on the ground they can become a well-rounded and competitive airline. But until then despite a great inflight product I will avoid them.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Emirates,2.0,S Hook,7th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | London Gatwick to Dubai return. The Emirates A380 is huge, quiet and with a brilliant in-flight entertainment system, only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But that's where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs, the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy, a choice of menu that's undeliverable by the time they've reached the middle of the flight, staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked what's possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley, and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice, who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight, the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers, two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes (!) after my wife's vegetarian ""choice"" was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isn't what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was ""left"". When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice (chicken with olive sauce) I had to ask for a drink, and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way - it was half the length of the plane away! Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals, but we at the ""back"" were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient, people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives, more people will avoid it than choose it! Leaving you short of choice! The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight - constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion, the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. It's all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on what's on tv, and food and drink service is a secondary concern, I for one won't fly with them again.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to DXB,November 2016,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,no

When we landed it took 30 minutes before we went up to the gate. For some reason that always happens every time I fly Delta.

I'm never flying Delta again unless they upgrade their aircraft and stop overestimating the arrival times. My flight to SFO was estimated to be 6 hours, so the ground staff at the destination prepared for that duration.

With the whole flight crew knowing that they had over 85% of the flight needing to be on time with their connecting flights. We were assured that the crew did not know any information and they could do nothing to help us. Once we landed, the captain casually said that we were over two hours late. He never apologized for the horrible landing or terrible timing that had occurred. Then we were advised to go the help desk and we would be assisted there. They had one staff member helping our whole flight. We weren't booked to fly out until the next day, in which we had to fight to get a hotel to stay in for over night. Jet Blue did not care about anyone's time management or money. Every single flight that we had or saw was delayed. It is the worst airline I've ever flown on and will never recommend it to anyone.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Fort Lauderdale,April 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,no
Air Canada,1.0,Jan Cafferty,22nd December 2014,From start to finish my experience of Air Canada was one I don't want to repeat unfortunately. From them changing planes and not notifying me so the exit row seat I'd paid for to accommodate my 6ft 5 son was no longer available to the poor quality food on the plane (the vegetarian tea time snack consisted of a banana plum and Satsuma) and the functional but not welcoming staff and the very narrow seat on the 787 all in all a very disappointing experience. The only plus points I could find were the online check in and bag drop and the entertainment system on the 787.I would best describe Air Canada as a transatlantic budget airline but maybe I've been spoilt by travelling with far superior airlines in economy class in the past.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no

What was interesting how the cabin was separated though not with a divider so it felt very exclusive. In addition, there was a blanket and headset for watching the back seat TV.

United Airlines,7.0,W. Robert Kmen,21st April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This United flight was the return part of a same-day trip Washington to Tampa return. Both flights were boarded with good discipline, pushed-back early, and arrived ahead of schedule. The service in economy was minimal, but there was a normal beverage offering: soft drinks for free and alcoholic beverages for a reasonable charge. I reserved and received the exit row window seat, which is my favorite. The personal device service onboard is a step forward, but the flight map included is much inferior to the one Lufthansa offers. As a Star Alliance Gold, I took the hike over to the B concourse to enjoy the Lufthansa Senator Lounge, which was surprisingly uncrowded. These last few weeks have been a trial-by-fire for United Airlines. Many frequent flyers have been outraged by egregious onboard errors, but my experiences with United have always been positive.

Emirates,4.0,Elliott Patricia,6th January 2014,I flew with my husband on our first Emirates flight on EK434 and EK435 Business Class to Brisbane in November we usually fly BA or Singapore Airlines. I have a few comments to make on the trip first of all the food and drink service was appalling. We had to wait for service were omitted on several occasions and by the time the drink came around the meal was finished. I asked for drinks on a number of occasions and didn't get it even using 2 different male/female cabin crew. I had to get up myself and go to the bar for water on several occasions to find the staff chatting quite happily in the rear oblivious to the alert light I had pressed for assistance . But the most disappointing part of the trip was on the short stopover in Dubai business Lounge on the return flight we expected to have a shower and change. The facilities in Dubai were pathetic there were queues and the turnover in cleaning the shower cubicles was painfully slow. We gave up and continued on our journey without refreshing the Business lounge in Dubai leaves much to be desired it is difficult to find food and the way it is designed could definitely be improved. After British Airways and Singapore Airlines and Qantas we would put it bottom of the list.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,no

The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Z Nazir,1st April 2014,We boarded a flight from Edin to Istanbul on 23/3/14. The cabin was rather small (seating of 2 and 3) and the air- conditioning was rather warm! Seats can be rather cramped if you are on the plus size. No negative comments about the food though. However Istanbul airport was chaotic. Going through passport control took us a good one hour. The next leg of our flight was Istanbul -Kuala Lumpur on a much bigger plane. Again the food was satisfactory. Service was ok and inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies.

The return flight from Detroit to Paris was most disappointing in comparison - with unfriendly crew, after meal service not seen again until an hour before landing in Paris.

After a wait of 1,5 hours on the phone we were told they would put us on a flight the next day at exactly 24 hours later. There were a couple more flights going the next morning but the only thing they told us they could do is put us on a flight 24 hours later than the original flight.

We took four flights with them from Heathrow to Cancun via Miami and it was consistently bad. I hated that there was a surcharge for sitting together, something you expect when you are flying with a budget airline but not transatlantic flight. The food was dreadful, I am one of those rare people who quite like airplane food, but this was not good. â€œChicken or pastaâ€ was the mantra all the way down the aisle and when I asked for more information I just got chicken or pasta repeated. How about giving a full description over the tannoy and then no need to repeat it 300 times? I genuinely did not know what I was eating, it was unrecognisable. I left almost everything apart from the water. Finally the crew, really not nice people and only one flight attendant out of all we interacted with was pleasant. Their culture is one of (almost) intimidation, very unfriendly even for a Brit. I know they are probably tired but there was a real feeling that we were a nuisance and they donâ€™t want to offer a service - not that we used the bell once during any of their flights.

I supposed to meet my sister at Heathrow Airport in London so we booked a hotel in London airport for the night of 27th until next morning Tuesday 28th because we had tickets to go in Paris, France. So we checked in just fine in Atlanta we went through security lineâ€¦ no problem we got at the gate in time, we got our seats, boarding passes and then we were waiting to go in a plane to Chicago. Right when they scan our tickets, they told us to get on the side to fix the boarding passes because the â€œsequence #â€™s are wrong! And was British Airways mistake (so either way was not our problem). Instead of taking the time to fix our problem the lady and her co-worker they were trying to fix other people problems and didnâ€™t let us go in a plane even that we told them our next bookings and connections we have. They called the manger in charge for that day and she didnâ€™t care to figure out what is going on. She left because she had a emergency problem not â€œminor problemâ€ like ours so we were left I Atlanta airport. They finally put us on 10:00 pm direct flight from Atlanta (the only one available) So we had to spend all day in airport and miss our hotel night and almost the flight to Paris. We had a check in luggage that travel to Chicago and couldnâ€™t be located so we had to file a claim when we got in Paris.

Air Canada,8.0,P Smith,11th July 2014,YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Outbound flight on new 787. Return on 777-300. The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

Air Canada,2.0,Ahmad Nadim,19th January 2015,In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel. This was the first time we travelled with Air Canada and will be the last.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,8.0,Martin D Hiu,29th March 2015,DMM-DXB-BKK on March 26 - In Economy Emirates has a solid offering few airlines can match. Crews are friendly courteous.

For example there was a crying infant who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child although not taken by the offered customer her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers. Food on this route is enjoyable Asian style chicken. Got upgraded to Business on the first leg which is very nice of Emirates to recognize my status with them.

United Airlines,3.0,K Walton,10th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This is my first trip I've planned with United Airlines in a very long time. My flight from Denver to Philadelphia was fine, I have no issue. My flight from Philadelphia home to Denver was awful. It was on one of their newer planes, and I had absolutely no room on this plane. I'm 6'1"", and I feel like I had to squeeze into my seat. I couldn't hardly move the entire flight, and after getting home, my body is still aching from that flight (two days later). I have a very limited budget and cannot afford the luxuries an upgrade has to offer. I can't help that I'm so tall, I don't feel like I should have to pay extra just to sit in a seat that won't leave my body hurting for days after. I've never had this issue on any other airline, even on newer planes of similar models. I'm not sure if this is a manufacturing defect, or they purposely made the rows so close together that I had to have my knees jammed into the seat in front of me (more so than usual), or the seats so tiny I could barely move or even buckle my seat belt. I am not an overweight person, I've never been this confined on a flight in my life, and I travel pretty frequently.

American Airlines,8.0,C Reynolds,21st April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Sao Paulo to Los Angeles. Haven't flown AA for many years and had read reviews that made it sound bad. Turned out we had a very nice experience. As an Alaska MVP Gold, we got Main Cabin Extra seats- the increase in pitch from 31"" to 35"" made a huge difference during the 12 hour flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable, plane was clean and entertainment system had decent options. Took off at 10:30p (on time) and shortly after, flight attendants came through with drinks and a dinner service. Wine choice was decent and food was as well. Portions were small but for us just right to sit for 12 hours. FA's came through and picked up quickly and cabin lights dimmed for sleep. Flight attendants were very nice, efficient. Had a nice talk with one of them- this route takes more than 20 years seniority with AA but FA's were engaged and helpful. I asked for a head set for the entertainment system and one of them remembered and found one for me. All in all a good experience. Landed at LAX at the American terminal and had a long hike to the International terminal to go through customs. Baggage showed up promptly and in good condition.

I must say the experience was great, customer service was friendly and always felt taken care of during the flight. We enjoyed our Aegean Air experience so much we decided to book our next flight in October 19 to Rhodes for our honeymoon. We got a good deal with our flights, however we wished to extend our stay in Rhodes by 3/4 days and Aegean air were going to charge us double our flight cost for us both plus 50 euro each booking fees for changing a flight from a Thursday to Monday. This is rather high for changing one part of our flight.

United Airlines,2.0,T Hoang,23rd September 2015,"I've flown United Airlines many times, mostly domestic. They've been equally bad each time, but this flight bothered me more since it was a long flight. And maybe I've been spoiled by other good airlines that operate US-Asia routes. The plane looked a little old. Seats were pretty small (for reference, I'm 158cm tall). The entertainment screen looked like one from 20 years ago: touch screen, but you press five times and it still goes to the wrong button. However, they had a decent selection of movies and shows. I tried to play a movie but it kept freezing every five minutes. At first I thought it was just mine who had problems, so I pushed the call button for a flight attendant. 30 minutes later, no sign of any flight attendant, I gave up and already prepared to sleep for the remaining 12 hours of the flight. It turned out later, it was an issue with the whole entertainment system on that flight. After they reset the system, which took another 20 minutes, mine worked ok, but I know I was one of those lucky ones. The food onboard was terrible. I was pretty hungry but still didn't finish any of the meals they gave me. Well, they got me to Tokyo in one piece, so at least there's that.

United Airlines,3.0,J Zain,30th April 2015,It's unbelievable that United continues to use ageing Boeing 747's on transpacific flights. 747's don't even have monitors behind the seats in economy class! Very disappointing when you can't choose what to watch on an 11 hour flight! In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled. I've never received such a response on Asian airlines. Will definitely avoid flying United in the future if I can help it.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,no

(be aware that even though it says Alitalia in really huge writing on the walls behind the desks, that there are different flight names displayed on the TV's above them in small writing up in the corner of the TV). I told the lady that the guy standing right there directed me here, and that it says Alitalia right there, then she pointed out that its what's on the TV. So we go in this long line & wait. We get to the counter, & the guy starts talking to another man (which seemed to be a supervisor). We thought that maybe he was being trained so they were talking him through it, but they kept talking and laughing. We waited for awhile before I asked if there was an issue w/ our tickets. Then, he calmly says, I can't find your tickets, you'll have to go to the help desk over there. I told him we didn't have a lot of time because we had already been directed to the wrong line & that our info was right there. He said I can't help you. So we go over there & there is about 8 people in front of us & only 1 person working at that desk. I'm starting to panic at this point because I didn't want to miss our flight, we had even came really early! I tell my bf to wait inline while I go back & see if someone else could help us because it seemed like this guy didn't know what he was doing at all. I ask a man standing up front to help because we are running out of time, he directs me to the same guy that we just dealt with - I tell him we are going to miss our flight, he says you have plenty of time. I couldn't believe how he was treating me. I was so frustrated, I had to walk away. I went back to my bf & told him, he went to the kiosk to see if he could print them while I waited inline. I get up to the lady tell her he couldn't find them, she calls over to him, writes something on the paper & says go back over there & they will take you right away. (Her attitude was not any better she was rude as well!!) So I turn & rush to get my bf from the kiosk & she starts yelling at me to go back to that desk & I told her that I have to get my bf, then she says ma'am you don't have time!!! (I know we don't have time!!) So we go back to the man to get our tickets & we cut the line like she said to. He refused to help us right away, so my bf says are you guaranteeing that we will not miss our flight? He says yes & then I think he worried so he stopped helping the other people & got us our tickets. We had to run to get to our gate. we barely made it. Then the boarding lady was taking bags because there was no room & gets into it with this elderly couple because they refused to give her their bags, because they lost their bags last time. She was not understanding at all, they ended up not letting them board, instead of letting them keep their bags.

United Airlines,1.0,S Hamez,23rd May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Albuquerque to Raleigh Durham via Denver. This has got to be the worst experience with an airline. Never in my life have a missed a flight and due to unforeseen circumstances we were running a bit behind. When checking in our bags there was a further delay due to some baglogs with the luggageâ€™s. Since we were running behind, we asked how we were doing on time for boarding and the lady looked at our bags and said we had plenty of time. Then the TSA line was running very slow and were not able to do anything for us to expedite the process. We run to our gate and we find the gate closed but the desk attendant was opening the door for a passenger, but then as she is closing the door while the plane is still there, she just says YOUâ€™VE MISSED YOUR FLIGHT. - again, she had just opened the door for a man right in front of us. The plane was Still there for another 7-10 minutes before it got disconnected from the bridge! Now there is no other flight to get us home until midnight, minded that we pleaded with her and told her that we have another flight to catch in the morning to Chicago. I understand the policy of getting to the airport with plenty of time to spare, unfortunately our morning was filled with issues that held us back. I donâ€™t know what was going on with her day but that sure is not a way to show customer service. She was also rude and not cared one bit about our situation. I hope that as a corporation you are also training you employees about customer service, care, and a bit more of humanity.

Of course, we missed our connection in Houston (where we were also instructed by United to pick up our bags and recheck them, which was ridiculous given the timeframe), and then were put onto another flight from Houston to LA, which gave us 20 minutes in LA to make our flight to Melbourne or else we would be stuck there for another day. When we asked if we would be provided with a hotel, we were told ""Sorry, none of this is our fault"".

Southwest Airlines,2.0,Maureen Rogers,27th July 2016,"Albuquerque, NM to San Antonio, TX via Dallas, Love Field TX. I have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. My family lives in RI, and I live in NM. So I travel cross country once or twice a year, plus vacation and work trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Quebec, Mexico, and last winter Cambodia. I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines. Over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip, due to lengthy waits in security, and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier, as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway? I can go swimming in Albuquerque. The first such moment was when I got to the airport at 7:00 am for my 8:55 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. It was posted as delayed, now it's just gone. I have to wait until I am called to be told how I will be rerouted. So now I am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later, to make a Dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. So I can still pick up my rental car during daylight. I make it to Dallas, I get on the plane, we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to San Antonio. No we are now waiting an additional hour and 45, due to bad weather. Well, ok, I can still do my drive before it gets dark (I've never driven in San Antonio). I can even get off the plane if I want, I will just have to reboard (because that is so much fun). So it is really pretty hot in here, but it is too late to go home. We can leave now, (so they say).

Turkish Airlines,2.0,J Konopak,30th March 2015,I fly Turkish to IST from several locations in Europe in economy. The airplanes tend to be a bit older and the crew tends to be pretty much the same as most airlines have in economy. Catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo can't speak about the inflight entertainment because I never use it. However there is one huge negative - the online checking is a mess giving PNR or e-ticket number works maybe 10% of the time and I'm forced to go to the airport early and queue to get a boarding pass even though I don't have any luggage. This is the only Star Alliance airline where this happens to me I've checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets. I've now started to avoid Turkish flights just for this reason as I need to waste about an hour in their huge and chaotic queues at Istanbul which also destroys any potential trip satisfaction.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,no

I hope Qatar Airways will provide some more legroom to its passengers.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

I am sitting in the Maldives a day later than I was supposed to arrive waiting for a sea plane for two hours, because Emirates overbooked my flight from Dubai to the Maldives. They kicked my husband and I off the flight with absolutely no other option. So we had to get up at 1am and take 4:30am flight to get into the Maldives a day late. Their rude clerks informed me this was my only option. Since we had to reschedule our sea plane to our island, I am stuck at another airport waiting for hours since all flights for today were already booked. Oh did I mention this is supposed to be my honeymoon. Emirates cost me a day and a half at my beach resort on my honeymoon. Their consolation round trip tickets are all well and good except I don't have any time off of work to travel again, and we really can't afford another vacation.

They used tired old 747's and A330's from the old Northwest days but a completely refurbished cabin makes it feel like a new plane. Huge new seatback screens feature USB and charging ports. Delta is making an effort to upgrade economy service on transpacific flights handing out free eyeshades earplugs and greatly improved ""Billboard"" branded earbuds. Delta on Demand has hundreds of movies TV and music choices to keep you occupied on these 14 hour flights. Food service is about the same edible but nothing special. Two hot meals and a mid-flight snack consisting of a sandwich fruit and cookie. Service by veteran flight attendants at the top of the seniority list is pleasant and friendly.

Lufthansa,8.0,Robert Marshall,15th August 2014,Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Y Tang,25th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This is a horrible experience. My mother-in-law travel with United from Denver to Shanghai via San Francisco. The flight was supposed to depart at 10:50AM. However, it delayed to 2PM due to mechanic issues. What is more annoying is that they postpone the flight by every half hour, meaning that they said it would delayed to 11:xx. When it was getting closer to the delayed time, they delay again to 12:xx. Again, when it was almost 12:xx, they delay it to 1:xx. Several times! The most annoying thing is that they didn't even know when it could fly, and they came to ask your decision, if you wanted to fly today, or tomorrow! OK, if it was myself, I could handle it. But the traveller was a 72-year-old, non-English speaker. Because of this delay, she missed her second flight from SFO to Shanghai. She definitely needed assistance in SFO, either logde into an hotel or some place for rest. When I call United's customer service (headquarter), they couldn't connect me to their branch in SFO. My mother-in-law had to find the United counter by herself. When I asked what to do with her checked-in luggages. They said my mother-in-law needed to picked it up from carousel and re-check it! Isn't it you messed up the trip. In the past 2 years, UA has delayed my flight for at least 3 out of 5 times for mechanic issues.

American Airlines,3.0,Alex Holt,10th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Miami to Nashville. My husband and I were returning home from our wedding/ Honeymoon in St. Lucia on Flight AA4658 from Miami to Nashville and I was carrying my very expensive wedding dress on the plane. I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response.

The seat itself coverts into lie flat but does not seem to be much wider than the economy class seat as they are arranged 8 abreast. Feet have to be put into quite a narrow slot that makes it difficult to turn over. A lot of the flight entertainment movies were old James Bond titles.

Jetblue Airways,3.0,S Morris,9th June 2014,Used to love JetBlue but my last trip a couple of days ago changed my perception. The plane seemed to be old and in a poor condition. Basically none of theâ€œcreature comfortsâ€ worked. We had 2 seats. The seat back on the 1st seat was broken and would not stay in the upright position. The video screen on the 2nd seat worked but the screen itself would not stay put. The reading lights did not work on either of the seats significant on a late-night flight. The plug for the audio on the 1st seat only worked occasionally. There were plenty of open rows of seats but they all required us to pay extra so we could not be moved to those seats. Otherwise our only option was to move from an aisle and middle seat to a window and middle seat. It was a long flight (JFK to SFO) and we get up and walk around every hour or so and just did not want to impose on another (probably sleeping) passenger that frequently so declined this option. Bottom line is that while the legroom was great and the people were friendly the seats were uncomfortable and plane appeared to be old and in disrepair. Certainly not worth the extra money that we used to be willing to pay to be a passenger on a JetBlue plane rather than on a competitors plane.,,,,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Jodi Zigler,9th March 2015,We booked a flight from BWI to IAH for 2/22 at 7.10 am and were scheduled to arrive in Houston at 9.45 am. Instead we did not arrive until about 8pm. It was an all day ordeal and we lost an entire day of our vacation. United had mechanical issues on flight 234 but after many delay announcements it took them until about noon to cancel the flight. We sat on the plane for a short while then for many hours in the airport until they cancelled it. Then we had to go all the way back out to check-in to wait in a line for about another 2 hours to be told there were no flights at BWI to Houston that day. United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone. On our flight from Dulles to IAH I was seated in a middle seat separated from my husband which was very difficult because of all the turbulence and my motion sickness. Our experience with United when flying back started out much the same - computers down very long lines and few United employees to help.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,5.0,Daffa Ghifari,7th February 2016,"I would like to say that KLM is just a good airline for me, however, my flight from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta wasn't that good! Everything before boarding to the aircraft was perfect. I sat on 33A (window seat) and the window was extremely dirty and scratched. The IFE was very annoying, it isn't touchscreen and the remote did not respond quickly. It also has lack of album, songs, and movie. The seat was pretty decent, with 3-4-3 seat configuration. I did enjoy the meal and staff service.",Boeing 777-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,KUL to CGK,January 2016,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,yes

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,5.0,Mary Lennon,3rd November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dublin to New York via Amsterdam. My husband and I had an awful experience with KLM. We missed our connection to NY. Us and about 30/40 others. When arriving in Amsterdam we were just left to figure it out for ourselves. No guidance. Booked us on flight for the next day. Gave us a bag with a toothbrush. Told us we could not get our luggage. Put us in a hotel in the middle of no where. The KLM ground staff are rude. No one was helpful in any way. The flight staff were lovely. We were stuck in the very back of the plane. Totally cramped it was awful, but the food and staff were good though. On landing in NY we discovered one of our bags was lost. Our cab had to wait for an hour and twenty minutes while we made a lost baggage claim. Again. No help from the ground staff. No KLM staff available in lost baggage office. Got nasty Delta lady who told us it's a KLM problem. We at least got a reference number. So I just called KLM to ask when I could expect my bag. I was asked to ham up and call back as this representative's computer was down. I called back and was eventually told I could expect my back within 8 hours. Our bags were at the airport in Amsterdam for 20 hours! How can one bag not make the flight? Do not use KLM. If there is a problem they suck. And if you do decide to fly with them, upgrade your seat.

United Airlines,3.0,D Meare,22nd March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Panama City to Los Angeles via Houston, and quite disappointed with the in flight service. First, it was a 4 hour flight over lunch, and international. However snacks (except for one tiny bag of pretzels) and meals were only available for purchase at high prices. Maybe Iâ€™m just conditioned to the high standards of Delta and American and expect to have at least a substantial snack on any flight longer than three hours. Additionally, in flight entertainment was not free, but my monitor was not working anyways. Finally, seat comfort is not great. The head rest pushes ones head forward and makes sitting for 4 hours quite uncomfortable. Overall, Iâ€™m not impressed.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,L Ford,28th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | The staff were very friendly on the planes. The KLM app was a lifesaver and had all the information we needed so would definitely recommend people downloading this app when flying. On our way there the plane took off 40 minutes from the time it was suppose to and on the way back it took off 45 minutes from when it was suppose to, there wasnâ€™t too much difference in the time we landed as it was only about 10-20 minutes difference but this was slightly inconvenient due to our transfers and pick ups waiting. On the flight home the airline overbooked and were trying to get people to get on another flight, they also started saying they wanted to check in carry on luggage and one man working for KLM lied and said that we were all only suppose to have one carry on and not another small bag- just an item like a purse or an umbrella, not a backpack, I looked this up immediately after and could see clearly on the website that it stated we were allowed a carry on luggage bag to go in the top and another small bag (40cm etc) that can fit under the seat in front of you which means he definitely only said it because they over booked and wanted peoples hand luggage checked in which was a bit sly. Overall all though it got us to where we needed to be safely, the staff were very nice, the snacks on the plane were tasty and it was good.

Southwest Airlines,7.0,C Walsh,18th February 2015,"Traveled Buffalo - Tampa at end of January. First time flyer with SW. Purchased early bird check-in in a bid to protect a better boarding position (and overhead bin space). Was assigned mid-A group so did get the seat location and bin space I was after. The entire boarding process is just a bit too odd for my liking with numbered posts and suspicious-looking 'post squatters.' I didn't need a calculator to know there were some queue jumpers at least within the 'A' group. Seating is just ok I thought the pitch was a bit tighter than the 32"" advertised and while I got the seat location I wanted I ended up with a group 'C' middle-seat'r who felt entitled to both armrests and wasn't exactly on the lean side. The in-flight service was fine the aircraft new and bright the flight crew fairly amenable and the flight left and arrived on time. Just can't get past the boarding system though.

The FAs on the connection flights were courteous and competent. On Delta after the beverage cart had gone by I asked a passing FA for a second glass of wine. She refused to bring it told me I'd have to wait until the beverage cart returned which was over an hour later. The Economy Comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - slightly more legroom but the recline seemed the same. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats.

Of course, my new allergies started going crazy! The flight attendant was going to upgrade me to first class but there was a dog there also and only God knows if I was allergic to that breed. I was moved to the back of the plane and allergies were kept at a minimum the entire flight.

Aegean Airlines,2.0,R Saltyeva,21st December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Thessaloniki. The worst part is how they carry on about the luggage. The ticket just said that 2 pieces of hand luggage are allowed. However when I checked in I was told that my luggage does not fit the requirements and that I am not allowed to take airport shopping with me on board. In spite of repeated questions the woman at the gate would not say what the definition of a personal item and carry-on luggage is. There was one that wanted to ban me from boarding because I dared asked them questions or complain about the service, which other people were doing as well. I had a standard-size cabin suitcase and a small handbag. I was charged extra for this. In spite of paying extra for it, the bag was removed from me and I ended up travelling without my personal belongings. There was plenty of space under the front seat for my luggage so lack of space is not reason for this approach. Staff are generally unhelpful and take the attitude that customers have to do the work. There were people who after queuing for 30 mins to check in were told that they should have checked in prior on an e-machine. And staff who are supposed to assist with this were curt and unhelpful. The woman who was helping me started serving another customer in the midst of serving me. She then accused me that I was not entering a long sequence of numbers on the booking correctly. She was supposed to be helping me do this. An FA got angry because I asked for brown instead of white bread and I had to ask for wine twice. They said they had forgotten it. When we reached the destination people with bags a lot larger than mine were getting off the aircraft.

Emirates,7.0,A Lampard,8th March 2016,"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good.

Aircrafts are fairly new and well maintended, and in general, all crew members are efficient. I have to say I really like this sense of multiculturalism there is on board. I normally fly Qatar for long haul flights, and the ammenities provided are kinda nice, especially for red-eye flights (eye mask, toothpaste and toothbrush, etc). I don't really need it, as I like sleeping while flying or read my own books, but the inflight entertainment system has lots of options, too. The last two times I used Qatar I had the same thought about food, maybe it's all about my own expectations, but it could be better. It just feels average if you compare it with others. Last time snacks were not that good and not really varied (it was also because due to time difference I had breakfast x 2, snaks x2 - felt very repetitive). I was unlucky to sit in the middle of the cabin, so once the crew served us, out of the 3 options available, only 1 was left.

We were told all connecting flights would be fine and that they would make up the time in the air. It wasn't until we were almost to Denver that they bothered to inform us of the added time to the flight and we arrived just in time to see our next plane depart. They did put us up in a hotel for free and got us on the next flight out the next morning only to have that plane stop mid-takeoff due to a plane malfunction.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Anders Pedersen,23rd January 2014,BKK-SGN. Very disappointed upon a first good impression that did not last: Aircraft 777-300 were old and worn. Staff pretend to be kind but were just assuming they could speak English. Basically no food on board and a very very poor cold sandwiched was made from remnants from the previous leg flown. Horrible. The 2 staff dressed as cooks were a joke: apart from clothes not clean they were just pretending and no foods were ever cooked or made for the flight. Could not get additional food. They told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip. An FA agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again. The mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much. After hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance. Menu cards were wishful thinking. Seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view. No earphones provided. No travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! Seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safety/emergency info card. Staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer. At least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies. We were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon. That gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food. I was allowed to try their ancient 1st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with 4 windows at a seat. The cabin was closed for service however as only business class is sold. Give only score 3 out of 10: two for being on time and one for an FA for being honest enough to admit food crises on board.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no

Lufthansa,8.0,Ben Apsley,28th September 2015,"Munich to San Francisco with Lufthansa, and we have flown it before. I enjoyed almost everything on this flight. The entertainment was top notch with tons of movies, television shows, documentaries, you name it. The inflight service could have been better, often thirsty and having to walk to the galley to get water. The food was okay. We were served lasagna which tasted sweet, not to my liking. The seats were comfortable. There was a lot more legroom on this flight than the flight there (an A380 where seats were crammed together). However on this A340 I felt there was more room. I would fly this flight again with Lufthansa.",A340-600,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MUC to SFO,July 2015,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Air Canada,1.0,Kyle Thiel,29th May 2014,Our Detroit to Toronto flight was cancelled after being delayed several hours which ensured we didn't have enough time to find another flight to make our Toronto to Munich connection despite originally having a 4.5 hour layover. Air Canada has no physical agents present at Detroit so after finally getting through to customer service we were able to rebook for the next day with an extra layover. The next day we get to Toronto to find out that they rebooked us on an overbooked flight so we actually found an Air Canada agent there to rebook us on a flight for later that night on a different airline. Coming back from Munich our flight was yet again cancelled after being delayed several hours ensuring we had no time to find a different flight. Of course there are no Air Canada agents to talk to in Munich either and the poor Lufthansa agents were terribly confused. Now I'm sitting here at the airport again wearing the same clothes because they refused to give us our checked bags back waiting for our rescheduled flight watching the agents at the gate try to figure out what to do with all of us who have boarding passes from yesterday currently saying we all need to recheck in which will no doubt delay this flight.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,LaCoille Morse,27th July 2014,Went on vacation July 9-18. Flight out to Denver was ok - nothing special. Seats were very cramped. Flight 2068 back from Denver to Boston was horrible! To start flight was delayed twice. We were a party of 4 sitting all the way in the back. From the time we got in the air until about three quarters of the way through the flight the two female flight attendants and one male flight attendant were just horrible. When one of the females came around asking for beverage requests I asked for a coffee. Everyone in my party received their drink except me no coffee. But it got worse! After drinks were served these three attendants proceeded to stand in the back by the bathroom and galley and talk and laugh extremely loudly with no regard whatsoever for all of us in the back of the plane including two toddlers who were trying to sleep. They kept up their loud talking and shrieking laughter for over an hour. It was absolutely horrible and disrespectful. I will never fly Southwest again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,4.0,no
Southwest Airlines,10.0,R Vondenhuevel,22nd August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Orlando. I made a mistake when preparing for my flight. I did not check if hiking poles were allowed on aircraft. They did not fit in either of my two free checked bags. Therefore. I attached them to my personal backpack to carry on the plane. I was stopped at the TSA security checkpoint and was told I was not allowed to bring them. They were expensive and I didn't want to forfeit them to TSA. My two previous checked bags had already been taken away for loading. I had pay $75 to check my personal backpack (being my 3rd checked bag). After purchasing the extra bag, I approached the check in counter. The Southwest employee told me that because the poles were not sealed in the bag (they stuck out of the top) there was a good possibility they would be lost and Southwest airlines would not be responsible for replacing them. I had not choice, but the take a chance. I secured them as best I could. The employee did not give me a luggage ticket, ensuring the airline would not be liable. After a nail biting 3 hour flight, I waited anxiously at baggage claim. Sure enough all three of my bags came through. The poles had separated from my personal backpack, but someone had secured them to my larger suitcase. I am extremely relieved and very grateful to that employee which ensured my belonging would get back to me. Thank you! As for the flight, the friendly staff provided excellent hospitality, offering snacks, drinks, and coffees. The seats allowed plenty of leg room.

We took our seats in the emergency exit row, which gave us extra legroom. The flight was approximately four hours long from Toronto to Calgary, mostly turbulent so the seatbelt sign was on most of the time, but the pilot and cabin crew did their best to keep us comfortable with regular updates and advice on when to head to the washrooms. The flight attendants were very helpful and cheery. Other than that, fairly standard beverage and snack fare, nothing memorable but nothing too horrible either.

They boarded the plane, drove to the runway, and turned around due to bad weather. The pilot never made any announcement about what was going on and we were on the runway for 2 hours for a 3.5 hour flight! They deplaned us and were not accommodating. The plane got delayed from 10:55 pm to 11:30 am the next day. They made all of the passengers sleep in the airport unless they paid for a hotel on their own. After all of the delays the staff managed to mess up my delayed boarding pass and didnâ€™t even book a connecting flight like they told me.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,N Nanayakkara,10th September 2014,Traveling from St Petersburg to Istanbul in business class - very disappointed the business class on this ageing 757-800 was no better than economy class. The seats were economy did not recline more than 15 degrees. The centre seat of an economy row was made inactive by folding it down. Hence calling the two seat arrangement business class. Extra leg room was there but was of no use as the footrest was fixed. How can they be called the best airline in Europe when they do not provide the basic requirement for a business class seat.

When the bag didn't arrive in Phoenix, they promised to deliver it. I arranged my schedule to be at home to pick it up. They called today to tell me to come get it because it was late check baggage. I am so angry! My husband has the car, plus it is at 1:30 hour round trip. They didn't say a word about a different policy because it was late check in. We should have just thrown out the jelly, but that would be expecting us to know their policies. I do not know whether the person who took the report was lying to me or simply incompetent. The seats were horribly uncomfortable on both parts of the trip. They want you to put carry-on items under the seats, but the seats are so close that it is very difficult to get them out again. The aisles are so narrow that even really skinny people hit other travelers when they walk down the aisles. The final part of our trip was delayed because the previous flight was late getting there. One of the flight crew kept trying to speed up the boarding process. He yelled at people not to block the aisles, and to let others around them. That seems like fine advice, but it seems he didn't notice that a lot of the people didn't speak English.

When I got to the airport, still no seats were available and the employee was less than helpful in offering another solution. Once I got to my ""upgraded"" seat, I found that I had no extra room, the armrest was broken and so was the tray table. The flight attendants and airport staff had zero personality and were not very friendly. I will do everything in my power to not fly with American Airlines in the future. To top it off, the only way to get in touch with customer service to file a complaint is via email. The representative who responded had no sympathy and basically told me to kick rocks.

We had two hostesses, one obviously beginner, shy to the point of not being able to look in the eyes while talking to us, and faster than lightning: the tablecloths are literally thrown on the shelves, the drinks served without presentation, she ran most of the time like most hostesses. The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points: the quality of the wines, including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device ""wifi"" control of audiovisual instruments did not work, despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced, pleasant and smiling, that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is non-existent in Phuket, for reasons never explained, and the car provided to Dubai was the worst, dented on its flank must, while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars, having two separate tickets.

Other than this I am sad to say on both flights I was disappointed with all aspects of their service. Our group were always split in the most odd fashion - even on our business class flight I was separated several rows apart which made no sense. Food options ran out on one flight - chicken or lamb my parents cannot eat lamb but they ran out of chicken - no alternative or other option! We were no where near the back row so obviously many other passengers only had lamb as an option! There are far better options out there for similar prices or cheaper. Don't make the mistake I made - don't fly Emirates if you have other options.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,no
American Airlines,2.0,Jose Montoya,25th May 2014,Boeing 777-300 GRU-JFK First Class. True waste of money or miles until crew's sense of premium service matches product.

Air Canada,8.0,D Wright,6th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Excellent service from the cabin crew, who greeted passengers by name and quickly offered sparkling wine, water or juice. This was in contrast to service on the ground. The Maple Leaf Lounge was a temporary facility and was overcrowded with poor food and drinks available. I left and used the nearby Plaza Premium lounge. Boarding was a bit chaotic with confusing queues forming 30 minutes before boarding time. The AVOD had a couple of issues, once freezing and going blank and having to be reset. The food was a bit disappointing, with an overcooked tenderloin and a limited wine choice. However, the FAs were superb, making passengers feel genuinely welcome without being intrusive. I know others have had issues with the executive pod seat, but I found it comfortable for both sitting and sleeping. Baggage arrived quickly in PEK.",Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Vancouver to Beijing,June 2017,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,1.0,R Neale,1st March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Jackson Hole to Reno via Salt Lake City. Weather mishap, compounded by lack of sympathy and poor customer service. Initial flight delayed 2 hours. Missed connection by 10 minutes. No attempt to get me off the plane (or the other 10 people on that connection) quicker was made. We possibly could have made that flight if we were allowed to exit first. Second, calling help line I asked when the next flight out was, she said ""tomorrow"" and laughed. They offer no protection for weather delays, I was given a toothbrush kit with bathroom essentials after lying on the terminal carpet for nine hours. I purchased a bottle of whiskey and put it in my carry-on in Jackson after checking with airline security that this was allowed. The next day, they actually tried to charge me to check my carry-on or dump the bottle out. Since I bought my own hotel room and left the terminal, this bottle was no longer considered safe. When I asked them to comp it as an ""I'm sorry how poor your flight was"" the check in lady said, ""it not like it's our fault you bought whiskey"" - after asking her supervisor, they comped the whiskey.

American Airlines,2.0,J Michaels,15th August 2014,"Flew London Heathrow to JFK. Had transferred from Qatar from JNB-DOH-LHR. This was a bit like going from a fine Hotel (Qatar) to a cheap roadside motel (American). The American Business Class lounge/Admirals Club lounge at LHR beyond the new entrance is simply a dump. Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar. I am thoroughly convinced that flying on American or any US Airline on long distance flights is wasting money and accepting poor treatment and it makes more sense to choose non US airlines which offer their premium customers a much higher standard of service.",,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,no
United Airlines,5.0,B Coleman,24th May 2014,All week long flying with our three year old we have preboarded the planes. Well upon boarding a flight that need I say arrived two hours late with United we were told to get in the back of the line with her as they have voided the children board first policy as of this weekend. He was rude about telling us and made it embarrassing as if we were doing something so wrong we were doing what we are used to doing not to mention we didn't just try to be the very first we actually got in line up 2 just because we weren't in any hurry to board. After all we all leave at the same time right? After waiting almost 4 hours at the airport with a toddler because of a delayed flight that's not how to really brighten someone's day and treat them. Maybe if you want to change a policy like that again and be butts about it at the gate be sure everyone is aware of your new stupid rule!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,no

Emirates,3.0,Denis Teulon,9th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that â€œComputer saysâ€ itâ€™s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is... My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard. In short not worth the effort of flying Emirates!",A380 / Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai,March 2018,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,no

Emirates,3.0,Darren Sharp,18th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to London via Dubai for the 2nd time in the last 18 months. I feel that on several levels, the Emirates product has declined in quality. Being 2m tall, I normally never have issues with being allocated an exit row seat so that I can sit without my legs being restricted by the seat in front of me. 2 weeks prior to flying I had called the Emirates Call Center and spoke to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that exit seats are only allocated on arrival at the airport. Fair enough, I got to BKK early and was allocated an exit Row seat on the flight to Dubai. I was told that I would then need to be allocated an exit Row seat in Dubai. Upon arrival at Dubai which was 3 hours before the flight departed, I was told that all seats had been allocated. Nothing could be done. Thats it. Surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating? Other issues. Toilets were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight. The cabin crew were rarely seen, and seemed quiet content to serve a passenger excess alcohol who was later abusive to passengers. Again, cabin crew were not concerned to sort or prevent this issue. If you want to treated like a herd of cattle, then Emirates are a good option. If you are looking for some basic comforts then there are many better options.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Dubai,August 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,S Vail,29th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via San Francisco. It was a rough trip flying back home to Pittsburgh. My family and I woke up bright and early at 4am to avoid LA traffic. Our flight was originally around 6-7am but then I was notified of a delay. Because we had a layover, we would not make our second flight home. I had to change my flight last minute which was fine because we were only maybe an hour behind schedule. My family and I were finally on our first flight and I was getting ready to sleep for the next 5 hours before landing in DC. I believe it was the autopilot who came on to talk about how they were having issues with the plane but he assured us that they are working on it. First they had the maintenance people come, then there was something about paperwork needing to be signed and finally, the autopilot mentioned that the gas was in the wrong area or chamber. I've sat on this plane for maybe an hour and half and now I'm rushing to call customer service to get me on the next flight ASAP because the flight was cancelled. Apparantly, the next two flight to SF was booked but my family of 3 can be waitlisted in case someone canceled. Did I mention that one man was absolutely going nuts when we all got off the plane? He mentioned something about his brother is on life support. There was also a huge line of people waiting to be waitlisted. However, I manage to book a flight for 12:58pm. At this point, my family and I have been at the airport for 7 hours. Finally, we get on the 12:58pm plane and we land in DC on time for our flight to Pittsburgh. It was storming on and off while on the first plane with plenty of turbulance. We were also delayed on the second flight! I thought they were going cancel our flight due to weather but they didn't and we did manage to get to Pittsburgh around 11-12pm. United Airline actually gave my family $300 for our next flight but the chances of us flying ever again is slim. This whole trip was an absolute nightmare with the delays and cancellation. On top of that, sitting in economy class is the most uncomfortable place to be. Honestly, take some advice from people who make genuinely comfortable lounge chairs with cushions in it please. There was absolutely no support at all and no room on the plane. The only good thing about the flights was that I was given free apple juice. I will never fly again if I can avoid it.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via San Francisco,June 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no
Qatar Airways,9.0,Anders Pedersen,29th December 2013,NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways.

I had very little time to board as standby and they held me up for ages over checking my carry-on because a group of them rudely pointed out to me there was no way it qualified as a carry on. (It had on Delta, however). Extremely unprofessional as a group of them stood behind the counter talking and laughing about me while I was paying to check my now extra bag. They were so cold and unable to empathize, that for that experience alone I would never willfully fly Turkish Airlines again. On the flight I pressed the call button twice because I never had time to grab water and the small glass they give you a couple times isnâ€™t enough for an 11 hour flight. My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out. When passengers were up and confused about the direction of where to go they were curtly told â€œyou canâ€™t pass through hereâ€ and then ignored. No smile, nothing.

Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back. I had a good short haul experience (B737-800). Leg space good and nice crew. Nice snacks were served there as well.

Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them.

I also got a blanket and pillow. There was enough room for me to stretch my legs out. Good choice of movies and shows. I was disappointed with food, not much of a choice on the menu and didn't have enough for 11 hour flight. One point they were handing out chicken sandwiches but turned out to be a pastry filled with mush. Staff were okay, they weren't smiling. At least 8 hours into the flight, they eventually handed out small bottles of water. But flight was good, no turbulence, smooth landing in Doha. I was looking forward to a flight on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner but they changed it to a Boeing 777-300er. London to Doha I flew the A380. Great aircraft, good legroom for economy, food was sort of the same, except they handed out a decent chocolate bar. Entertainment systems newer than the 777. They were great, I watched a few movies and slept most of the time. Then another smooth landing at Doha. I was impressed of the A380. Another Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Perth. A kid in front of me pushed his seat back on boarding and cabin crew walked by and did nothing until takeoff. Once we took off, the seat came down again for the whole flight.

Plane also came with your own personal tablet/tv with a great variety of videos and movies to watch. The pilot continuously kept us informed, as occasionally there was some turbulence. The stewards very humorous and friendly. My son said after, ""mom I like flying"". I was very impressed from the time I drop my luggage off all the way to picking it up.

Flights were both very nice, Economy Comfort provided at no cost to Platinum card holders is an excellent benefit and the few extra inches make the flights much more comfortable. In-flight refreshments were excellent, I was upgraded for the second flight so they were even better but even in economy there is a good selection of drinks. Staff are always friendly and efficient in my experience and these flights did not disappoint.

Well we flew out early at 11.24am! Then we got to Atlanta and all went to hell. Delta offered us 1 seat (split us up) on the next early flight not 2 (1 for each of us) so we asked if there was any other way and they said nope, nothing we can do. I asked about our checked bags and was told they would stay here until we depart at 9.20pm, 8.5 hours after landing. At 5pm I got an alert that my luggage was at my final destination while I was still in Atlanta. So after going round and round with this screw up on Delta's end, I'm about to get on the 9.20pm flight with no luggage and not even an apology from them.

United Airlines,1.0,E Allen,5th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Santa Barbara via San Francisco. Worst. Experience. Ever. From start to - and not even at our final destination yet. Iâ€™d give them zero stars if I could. Flight from Buffalo to Newark was delayed for 2 hours (understandable as Iâ€™ve traveled extensively in the past.) While waiting, the company tag line used on the plan to the passengers was as follows: â€œseems like its an electrical maintenance issue on Newarkâ€™s part. Sorry everyone.â€ Still relatively understandable. This made us miss our 2 other connecting flights moving forward. When trying to reroute our flights once we finally got to Newark, we asked the customer service rep for the airline to put us up in a hotel in San Francisco because weâ€™d be stuck at the airport until 8:45 am (after landing around midnight as it was the earliest flight to Santa Barbara/home.) â€œNo. It was because of weather. We donâ€™t do that if itâ€™s because of weather,â€ the customer service rep advised. At no point was the weather cited as any part of the cause for the delay! Whatever. Horrible attitudes with the employees at the gate as well. Finally we were able to get on to our re-routed flight (which, by the way, was also delayed for almost 2 hours as well.) I have a roller bag that easily fits in the overhead compartment. Before the plane was even 1/2 full, they started pulling luggage to check in. At the gate, I explained explicitly said that if I check my bag, I need to grab it from the gate itself and not have them send it directly to our final destination (Santa Barbara) or the general checked-in luggage. There was plenty of overhead space by my seat, mind you. Nope! We had to leave the gated area to the baggage carousels, where the flight attendant told us to go, and nothing. No bag. Apparently they were â€œholding itâ€ to get it on our last flight which leaves in 7 hours! I have things in there I need! And now the security checkpoint is closed so we canâ€™t even get back into a nice quiet area to find a place to sleep for even a little bit because of the sheer lack of communication, horrible customer service, and complete lack of empathy.

We had children at home and our sitter was leaving the next day so we had to get home, so being put on stand by with 100 other people was not an option for us. So we rented a car and drove for 9 hours. When we emailed the airline (there is no phone number to call according to the staff) they said we ""elected"" to take a car and they would not reimburse us. The refund for the ticket didn't even cover the cost of the car (because it was from a different state). We tried calling the reservation hot line and the women we talked to stay we wasted their time by calling. She actually said we wasted her time. Please do not fly with them.

Food was okay, which was also down to me as I am not fond of Camembert cheese. Drinks were available all the time in the galleys and also offered by the crew throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment offered plenty of films in several languages which was a nice touch as well. The only thing bad about this flight was a rude female passenger next to me complaining about me going to the loo twice at this 8 hour lasting flight, but that is not Lufthansa's fault at all!

First you go all the way to 1 end of the airport for check-in (the AF area), then you are sent all the way accross to the other end. There, 45 min queuing for security as there is one lane and no Sky Priority. Logically KLM flight should be handled with the AF terminal, where all is clear. After 45 min waiting the gate is not indicated, then you reach the gate where the personnel moves to another one (just telling a few pax around). At the gate, the AF personnel did not bother organising the flow, did not set the Sky Priority lane and just boarding randomly.

The flight departed at 11.10 am. The only female attendant on the plane is very rude. My 11 month old son was overheating and needed a diaper change. I was at the back of the plane and had to navigate my way to the front of the plane, where for some reason the only changing table is located. The bathroom was occupied. So I was perfectly OK with waiting the few seconds it would take for the bathroom to open up. The woman turned, saw me and without even asking if I needed anything or was OK, snapped, ""you know you can't wait here. You've got to go back to your seat."" I told her we had just gotten up there and that this bathroom was the only one with a changing table. She didn't care so I had to go all the way to the back of the plane and change my son on the pull down tray, which is disgusting for me and the other passengers. As if that wasn't humiliating enough, the woman proceeds to get on the intercom as I'm walking back to my seat to announce (apparently for the millionth time. Her attitude knows no bounds) that no one is allowed to wait at the bathrooms. I have flown Southwest many times, and enjoyed it. Lines have formed many times and it wasn't an issue. But this woman's behavior is unacceptable. My son was overheating and needed a change, yet I basically was not allowed to use the only lavatory on the plane that had a changing table.

Aegean Airlines,10.0,J Beattie,10th April 2014,I was booked on an evening flight from Santorini to Athens but arrived very late and after closure of the check-in desk. I expected the worst that is to be refused boarding but I was so impressed that the Aegean staff agreed to check me in opened the check-in desk and helped me to join the other boarding passengers very efficiently. Full marks for flexibility without compromising security or delaying the flight and that extra effort made such a difference and saved me from a nightmarish situation of cancelled onward flights and hotel.

In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly.

Of the 4 flights involved in my Napier-Auckland-Brisbane return flights the other day everyone of those flights were delayed in some form or another. Anything from 25 minutes to 1.15 minutes.

I was not late and had to wait for the gate to open once I got there using no express line. The flight attendants on the way to New York were nice, but the airplane was just something out of the 90s. No private screen (which is standard for British, United, Lufthansa, Swiss), no way to control the air conditioning (it was freezing cold), the audio from the audio jack was not working well and the seat pocket was a little broken. On the way back, the cabin crew, and particularly one flight attendant, was just so rude I could not believe my ears. I was asked if I wanted to change seats because I was seated close to the restrooms in the back and when I politely declined explaining that I wasnâ€™t feeling very well and wanted to stay close to the restroom I got a ""yeah, whatever!"" as a response while she walked away.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Ashwin Swar,15th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through. This is easily the worst travel experience of my life yet.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Kathmandu via Istanbul,2018-05-01 00:00:00,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board, something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we canâ€™t fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. The next time I travel to Melbourne I shall not be using Qatar.",,Business,Business Class,MEL-DOH-BAH,June 2015,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,D Duma,8th May 2014,Do not pay the extra cost for the comfort seats. That is the biggest scam that this airline has going. I have paid for comfort seats on KLM and WestJet and they were so worth it. This airline - expensive and the only thing you get is slightly more leg room. The same uncomfortable seat in all other ways. This airline has to have the worst service of all airlines in the G20 (sorry have not flown others). Terrible seats extra cost for luggage what food is available is awful and expensive and now you have to pay for inflight entertainment. On a recent flight to Hawaii at least they had the courtesy of telling us not to bother because the inflight entertainment did not work over the ocean anyway. I love to read but 6 hours straight is quite a reading marathon. I will pay extra costs for a flight rather than fly United.,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,10.0,Richard Callis,7th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai. Emirates is one of the few remaining airlines that offers a differential in Economy class. I love other airlines in Premium, Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product, the seat is comfortable, there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good, I like being provided with a menu prior to service, a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only (personal) regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK (I do this route frequently). They have such good deals to Africa and Asia I wish they would do the same for South America so I could fly with them more often!",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai,August 2017,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
United Airlines,1.0,B Toone,4th March 2015,"Just got hosed by United's new international luggage policy. Flew from US to Grand Cayman Island last week. No longer do they allow the usual 1 checked bag free which is the standard on international travel. $25 for my wife's bag and $25 not overweight not oversized just a regular bag. Seems now any checked bag now is charged for shorter international flights. Plus to make matters worse for some bizarre reason Grand Cayman will not let you go through security with a fly rod despite having flown all around the world with one and no problem from any other security. So now this has to be checked which becomes a 2nd checked bag at $40. $40 for a couple 30"" long by 1 1.2"" diameter tubes taped together! At least that one was only on the return leg. I travel a lot and while I cant say I will never fly United again since there are limited options anymore but it will flat out have to be my only option to a place I really want to go to. They even require you to pay if you wanted to watch the flight information screen which is just a GPS screen with a plane drawn on it showing where you are on a map!

Return leg was very similar: fast bag drop (with the hi-tech DIY machines) easy boarding (although remote stand this time) friendly crew on time departure and the economy comfort seats were actually business class seats on the Embraer 190.

United Airlines,1.0,J Howard,1st July 2014,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,no

When we were about halfway to Atlanta, we were told we would be arriving at 8:30 and that flights were being held, due to the fact that our flight was a connection for the majority of the passengers. When we landed, we discovered that none of the flights were held. We went to customer service and they booked us on the first flight the next morning. They didnâ€™t offer any apologies, were very unsympathetic, and rude. They refused to comp a hotel, so I ended up staying at the airport with my 2 year old daughter, her first flight.

Aeromexico,1.0,V Richards,4th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | My husband and I were flying from Mexico City to Shanghai. The plane from Shanghai to Mexico City was extremely uncomfortable in economy class (by the way, do not pay for the emergency seats, they are the worst seats,) so we decided to upgrade to Premium economy to better our seats (around $6,000 pesos more). When we checked in at the airport, we were charged $1,800 Mexican pesos extras for 3 extra kilos as apparently Premium economy means nothing. You won't get any sort of benefits whatsoever, so if you are reading this, just be aware about the luggage requirements and avoid checking in your carry on. You will not find any sort of helpful staff neither at the airport nor via phone to help you understand, clarify, or reinburse any money regarding this issue.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,Michael Connaughton,1st July 2013,Manchester - Amsterdam - Buenos Aires. Economy class. KLM were the cheapest and had the most convenient flight times. All flights more or less on time. Transfers at Schipol were effortless and smooth. In terms of inflight service I found it to be more than acceptable. Seat backs were a bit hard but overall 13+ hours in their seats did not feel unbearable at all. IFE was good but the outdated screens could do with an overhaul (777-200). I found the service to be good. The flight attendants were always visible and very attentive. They keep you well stocked up with food and drink during the flights. Yes attendants can be quite terse at times but this was mainly due to passengers ignoring the command to put their seatbelts on during times of turbulence. Elected to upgrade to Economy Comfort on EZE-AMS return leg in order to attempt up get some sleep and to be one of the first to disembark the plane due to a short connection time (45 minutes) and it was worth it.

On board in second cabin for Business Class did not appear to be as well attended as the main cabin and had to wait until the doors had closed for a pre takeoff wine while I could see in the main cabin they were having refills. Magazines only offered in main cabin. This is due to economy and premium economy passengers boarding via the second business class cabin space. British crew were a bit perfunctory, level of attention to detail was not particularly personal. First meal of blackened chicken with kale and pumpkin mash was adequate, breakfast undercooked and not edible (e.g. raw potato).

United Airlines,4.0,C Lin,23rd June 2014,In a recent long-haul flight (UA871) SFO-TPE business class again ran out of the Asian meal option. This occurred in 4 out of my 5 recent transpacific flights. The purser came and apologized. She said United loaded only four such meals into a business class that seats 44 passengers! With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration? It's pretty bad given that for the same fare one can fly in a much more spacious environment on competing airlines.

Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed.

Emirates,2.0,L Chua,20th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Unforgettable experience flying with Emirates from Singapore to Rome via Dubai. I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead. To make things worse, that flight was delayed for another 1 hour 10 minutes. I didnâ€™t know if I was traveling with Emirates or a budget airline that cancels flights on a whim. By the time I arrived in Dubai, my original 2 hour connection time had become less than 40 minutes. Ground staff in Dubai did not offer any form of assistance in making my connecting flight. I made it to the departure gate 5 minutes before closing time only to be told I had been offloaded from the plane. At no stage was I notified that I would be bumped from my connecting flight because of shorter than â€œminimum connection timeâ€ thanks to Emiratesâ€™ brilliant incompetence in punctuality. After some argument with the ground staff at the gate, I managed to get onto the flight with the supervisor granting me an act of grace, when itâ€™s Emirates which had sinned. But his grace did not extend to my checked in baggage however, which will only arrive with the next flight. Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day. I even received an email saying my bag will arrive in Rome at about 12.40pm on Saturday. Little did I know I would be slapped in my face with Emiratesâ€™ commitment to punctuality again. When I havenâ€™t received my bag at 5pm, I rang the baggage office, and was advised it had just cleared customs and would be delivered in the evening. 6 hours later I was still waiting, and followed up with another less than pleasant phone call. Upon which, the only solution they could offer is the contact number of the local baggage delivery agent. No, of course their gilded fingers canâ€™t possibly dial the number to follow up on a customerâ€™s delayed baggage. I finally received my bag on Sunday at 12.15am. Hooray for a change of clothes finally. No one from Emirates throughout this ordeal acknowledged their fault nor offered compensation for me to get a change of clothes and toiletries. Hello Tomorrow?

Emirates,3.0,Rajah Koppala,23rd April 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Hyderabad to New York via Dubai. Emirates standards have really dropped. Cons: Emirates b class lounge in terminal b in morning time is a joke. Food is consistently bad in these lounges and there is no a la carte. There is not a single chair to sit on. Horrible experience. Very noisy with spoons and plates clattering all the time. There are a ton of food options but all of them mass produced and on a hot dish. In flight experience also Emirates has no a la carte concept. Either you chose from that menu in those 3 hours or forget about it. No good soups or mild flavours they again gs for quantity over quality. During the entire time of 15 hours cabin crew is going by back and forth making sleep difficult. TheWorst part however is the fact that there is lounge in JFK. This is simple not acceptable. They give a 40 usd voucher which you can Use in any restaurant but almost all restaurants were closing. So I had a glass of wine and fries in McDonaldâ€™s. This is unacceptable. Pros: flight attendants on all sectors were very nice and tried to make up for an old and tired airline.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,J Rose,3rd February 2014,BKK-NRT-BKK in Business Elite on B747. Don't fly Delta much and was impressed with the product. Seats comfortable and private whilst seated on upper deck. Cabin ambience pleasant service attentive and professional IFE above average. In general a cut above the other American carriers and significantly better than the previous Delta international business product. Only disappointment was not having Premium Lane cards for arrival in BKK. BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK. I enquired about it with the crew and they were baffled and seemed to have no idea with what I was talking about as if they had never heard of it.

Delta Air Lines,7.0,J Mackay,10th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew New York JFK to Philadelphia. This flight did not last a full hour and I must mention that there is a marked difference between the friendliness of the international crew of Delta and the domestic crew of Delta. The domestic crew are far less professional on their behavior and attitude to passengers onboard. My connecting flight from Italy to New York arrived on time however the bags were placed late on the belt and by the time I made it through US customs and walked from gate 14 to 33 because no one in JFK was willing to help I arrived at the plane seconds before they closed the door. Upon entering the aircraft I was surprised because the flight attendant told me to sit in seat 4 D (Business Class) I thought this was due to the delay as a way of saying thank you I quickly found out she made a mistake and in front of everyone asked me to leave the cabin (I was embarrassed to say the least), realizing what she had done she offered me a ""Comfort Seat"", to be honest I did not notice any difference between that seat and a regular seat on coach. I have to say the aircraft looked brand new, clean and before I could buckle my seatbelt we were already in Philadelphia. Deltaâ€™s iPhone app is great for tracking your bags and other flight related info. My only observation is the marked difference between the domestic and the international crew. Overall I would fly Delta again, the planes look and feel new, clean, the seats and space are better than their other US competitors.

Alitalia,3.0,A Dranson,24th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew from Santiago de Chile to Rome in economy class and I thought the flight was terrible! The seats are small and because the headrest is not incorporated in the seat, it makes you sit in an awkward position with your head tilted forward. Extremely uncomfortable for a 15hr flight! The window seat has a metal box in front of it so there is no possibility of stretching your legs properly. Also uncomfortable. Spending such a long time on a plane is not very nice but one would at least expect the flight attendants to walk around with water. This was not the case. Once it was time to have a meal, the flight attendants serving the food were rude and did not speak english. What really struck me is that they didn't even have enough food for everyone and started giving out different trays. For example I had a little sandwich (butter and cheese in white bread), a cookie and an olive bread whilst my neighbor only got a strange looking green baguette sandwich. A plane has a certain number of seats and there should be sufficient food for everyone. Overall, I was disappointed.

Emirates,2.0,Ngisana Mngomezulu,24th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Hong Kong via Dubai. Our flight took off and about about 2 or 3 hours into the flight the captain of our flight announced that our flight had been turned back to Johannesburg due to a problem at Dubai airport. No further announcements were made. On arrival back in Johannesburg we disembarked the plane and waited approximately 2 hours to receive our luggage, after which we were ushered to a bus taking us to a hotel where we would spend the night. Bearing in mind that our hotel arrangements were in place when landed back in Johannesburg, this could have been communicated to passengers over the PA system or by Emirates ground crew. We were not given any update as to what would happen to our connections. We were shuttled back to the airport at 2am, boarding commenced at 3am and we took off again at 5 am. At no point were we given any indication of what would happen to our connections. When we arrived in Dubai (around 3:30pm) we were greeted with the chaos that was Dubai Airport, and then spent 11 hours waiting to be assigned new connecting flights. I was eventually given a connecting flight to Hong Kong 2 days later and put on standby for a flight leaving 3am on 5 August. Rudeness from Emirate ground staff, all we were given were muffins juice and water for sustenance. Not a single Emirates employee made an announcement to make sense of the chaos nor where there any notices or communications.

United Airlines,4.0,N Shane,26th May 2016,"San Francisco to Hong Kong. I was looking forward to my first time flying with United in an International leg. I have enjoyed their Domestic/Transborder route quite a few times. I've read on their website the improvement they made on their in-flight services so I was excited to experience it. But I knew my excitement will short-lived when I stepped into the boarding lunge to take my flight. Announcements after announcements were made by the gate agent that the flight will be full and that all big carry on must be check in. The boarding process itself was chaotic and the UA gate agents in SFO seemed annoyed and you can hardly see anyone smiling and genuinely greeting travelers as they board. They all look like they just want to get the boarding over and pass it on to the flight crew to deal with the guest. Once onboard, I was looking for the ""Plus"" in what United called their "" Economy Plus"" seats section. The seat pitch is just what other Airline like NH/CX/SQ offers in their regular economy section. The aircraft is an old 747 and it is quite ready to retire. Seats looks and smells dirty and really really old. I am a short person (5'6) and my knees almost touch the seat in front of me.There is also in IFE box under the seat in front which limits my legroom. Food service was the one I was anticipating and see how United made an improvement. The first meal service was a total disappointment. I wish I am lying right now when I say the food was horrible and inedible. I didn't finish my meal and only consumed the bread and veggies. THe second meal service was even worse. Noodles with no meat and it was so salty. Inflight entertainment is OK but on this aircraft, you have to download their Apps beforehand on your mobile device or else you will watch the Big Screen TV only that shows movie every 3hours. Flight Attendant are like robots and do a job without any emotion. Person next to me ask for another Ice cream and water and the FA told him that only one per passenger then left. FA's are nowhere to be seen after they turn off the lights after the meal service. I get up almost every hour on a long flight to stretch and not once I saw an FA. They re-emerge 2hours before landing to serve the meal. FA's are the worst I experience thus far travelling on an international flights.

Emirates,1.0,A Anderson,9th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home.

Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled.

American Airlines,6.0,Pierre Laville,26th December 2015,"As usual for any in/outbound flight to/from Brazil, boarding is slightly chaotic due to the lack of discipline of customers. Business class seating is barely appropriate for such a new plane. Private light not working, confusing reclining commands and even worst IFE system with several unexpected resets. Apart from a boring diner and a breakfast which I would recommend anyone to stay away from at any cost, the crew is only performing routinely, smiling and extra pampering optional. It seems that their presence is strictly contained at maintaining the cabin within permissible safety standards, all other tasks being sidelined. The herringbone layout of the cabin for some reason leads to permanent knocking on the back of your head from the passenger seating behind you.

My flight was on January 4th from Santo Domingo to JFK New York. That day they kept us all day updating the board with the delay flight sign to let us know at the end of the day that the flight was cancelled. I was supposed to stay in The Dominican Republic for 10 days but end up staying for 15 days. Calling my job everyday to keep them updated about the situation that I was going through. At the end I think they didnâ€™t even believe me, because every day I have to explain my boss how Jetblue couldnâ€™t find two seat to accommodate my boyfriend and I. I paid for those five days out of my pocket to stay in a hotel close by the airport because every flight the put my boyfriend and I were cancelled every day for those 5 DAY. My flight was supposed to be a non stop flight because I HATE to do Laid over, but guess what the only flight the had available was with a laid over in ft. Lauderdale. I ended up traveling January 8th at 4:00am from Santo Domingo to ft. Lauderdale. When I was in lauderdale had to wait till 7:00pm to get another plane to Newark not being Newark my flight destination. Because when I bought my flight it was from JFK to Santo Domingo â€œstraight flightâ€ and my returns was supposed to be Santo Domingo to JFK not Newark â€œstraight flight tooâ€ I spent almost 24 hours to get a flight which last just 3:45hrs. And the funny thing when I got to ft. Lauderdale I went to one of the JetBlue representatives to asks him that please if there were an earlier flight available because I think is was ridiculous to wait 10 hours in an airport for another flight, but the guys told me in order for him to do that I had to pay 75 dollars for me and 75 dollars for my boyfriend because I was trying to change the reservation that they already gave me. Even thought I explain him that I had an nonstop flight, but because of the situation of the storm they didnâ€™t give me any choice but to accept the laid over. I end up paying almost 2,000 dollars between the hotel, food and transportation from my hotel to the Santo Domingo airport and once I got to Newark I had to take a taxis to JFK parking lot because I left my car parked over there to avoid paying for taxi.

Alitalia,1.0,Margaret Wollaston,29th October 2016,"Rome to New York JFK. Alitalia are the worst airline I've seen so far. Cabin crew was rude, indifferent, unavailable for long periods of time, and they made me miss a connecting flight at JFK. There was an Italian family who boarded late, and once there, attempted to move into seats in business and premium economy. The drama that ensued was long and loud and it involved every member of the crew all trying to instruct them to take their assigned seats. They argued, the crew argued and finally, finally the purser convinced them to take their seats. This burned up 40 or 45 minutes of my connection time. We finally landed at JFK and sat on the tarmac for another 45 minutes. During the flight the cabin crew would appear for short periods of time to serve meals, but then go behind their curtains to their seats for hours. Totally unacceptable. The ground crew people were also indifferent and told us that checking in online is required, and if you don't do it they give your seats away. But just try and navigate their web site. It is incomprehensible. I would avoid Alitalia.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,FCO to JFK,October 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Jane Watson,8th May 2018,"âŒ Not Verified | Toronto to Ft Myers via La Guardia. The airline would not send a boarding pass to my phone. When I got to the airport, the kiosk would not print a boarding pass. There was no customer service rep at the desk. Consequently, by the time I was able to connect to a rep from Dallas, I had missed my flight. She rebooked me on a later flight, with two layovers, and charged me $119.00 for increase in fare. I received an email shortly thereafter that the flight was delayed, and that I may not make my connector flight. Once again, I called a rep who verified such, and she booked me on a flight going out the next day, the same trip I had originally booked, only one day later. I am now told, that even though I didn't take the first rebooked flight, the additional fees were not refundable. It was never brought to my attention that this was the case, I never even printed a ticket for such flight, that may have disclosed this.

Started of rather good but then the cabin came to take my dinner order. I asked to have red wine with my dinner after take off however nothing came until I had finished my dinner. The cabin crew said that they had been busy. I was not very impressed with the service but it was only on this particular flight and this particular cabin crew that did not know how to provide a proper service to a premium customer.

Flight attendants were rude, disinterested, and seemed like they hated being there. As I went to the back of the plane often to stretch my legs, I would hear the flight attendants saying nasty things about passengers. They hardly paid any attention to the passengers except what they were absolutely required to do, spending much of their time gossiping and goofing off in the back. I flew British Airways on the way there and the contrast is astounding. BA is far more professional and courteous to their passengers. Then once in DFW to make a connection, I spoke with two attendants at check-in desks and both were unhelpful and rude. I asked one guy if there was room on an earlier flight and to avoid checking he told me it would cost $100 to change flights (not what I asked). Then I was trying to help a lady who missed her connection, as the plane was still at the gate, and the attendant basically just said â€œtoo badâ€ and didnâ€™t offer to help her get on a different flight or anything even though it was AAâ€™s fault she missed her connection.

I flew Birmingham to Bangkok via Doha on the 787 Dreamliner first leg then A380 second leg. The 787 business cabin in excellent with plenty of space. The seats are 1-2-1 lie flat pod style all with aisle access. The service is always excellent, the staff are so well trained and always friendly, unlike Emirates. I had an amazing 4 course meal on the first leg, soup, fish, cheese cake and cheese board with 30 year tawny port. I watched 3 new movies on the 7 hour flight before arrival in Doha. I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar. I've had many good times in this bar but I didn't use it this time. I agree with other reviewers that Qatar offers the best business class, mainly due to the excellent staff.

Emirates,1.0,L Salter,15th February 2016,"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from.

I was sitting near to this woman who was playing Solitare on her screen and the man in front of her could not just relax watching the movie because of the constant poking to his seat. It even led to some tiny conflict in the end. People who like to enjoy alcohol during their flight, should definitely consider these airlines over the other ones, since they are serving alcohol drinks like beer, wine, cocktails on international flights for free.

Mine was the inside seat of only two in that row because of the stairway. My elbow bumped into the stairway wall and my vision was totally blocked on that side. Claustrophobic alley! A kind attendant was able to reseat me. Meals? The plane departed at noon and lunch was served at 1 pm. Lufthansa has been touted for its meals and I was looking forward to this part. The meal itself was good from my experience with airplane food. A few hours later an attendant passed out Toblerone chocolate bars. Several hours after that more chocolate bars. Mind you this was a direct flight. It landed 12 hours after it departed. The passengers had last eaten a meal 11 hours earlier! I think most people would need at least a sandwich or light meal in that 11-hour period. There were no meals for purchase on board no help in sight. I think Lufthansa definitely needs to look carefully at their meal policy for such extended flights.

Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this wonâ€™t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines.

While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely.

Trying to get home our plane was delayed once again missed our connecting flight got stuck in Arizona overnight. Didn't offer food or a hotel had to pay out of pocket. Then we have another flight the next morning - canceled. Then we get a flight to Chicago where we found out our new connecting flight we were not booked. Staff at Chicago O'Hare was incredibly rude. Like unbelievably. I want someone to do their job I'm paying you to do it. If they cant do their job find someone who can. I'm not paying thousands of dollars for this poor service.

United Airlines,5.0,Steve Bryant,19th April 2015,"A recent flight from London to New York recently was perhaps the worst experience we've had. We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth.

United Airlines,8.0,Mordey Stephen,22nd September 2014,I've been a Mileage Plus member and a United frequent flyer since 1995. The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes
Emirates,5.0,H Calavo,23rd April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in DÃ¼sseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.",A380 / Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Dusseldorf to Shanghai via Dubai,April 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes

I sat behind a family with two toddlers who stood on their seats, ran up and down the aisles and screamed the entire flight. I understand airline staff can't do much about the screaming, that is the job of the parents, however even when staff had to ask for the kids to be removed from the aisle so they could get the beverage cart from one end to the other, they never reminded the parents to keep the kids seated. Right in front of these ""parents"" there was a mom with one kid the same age and he was a perfect angel the entire ride. So to the parents who could not control your horrible children - a fail!

I was a loyal and proud Continental Airlines customer before the buyout. I have reluctantly continued to fly United because the connections from Houston are still the best there is. However, the service is appalling. On this most recent trip I was changed a hefty 2nd bag fee. Even though my expensive United Club card allowed me 2 free bags and the code-share partner, ANA allows for 2 free bags. United has lost my ticket.

Qatar Airways,10.0,J Gallian,18th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Doha to Philadelphia. After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatarâ€™s service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they donâ€™t give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone.

Qatar Airways,8.0,H Simpson,4th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, Â£1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.","A380, A320",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AUH to LHR via DOH,July 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,1.0,Vlad Perepichka,25th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dublin to Tel Aviv via Ä°stanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but thatâ€™s fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in Ä°stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see whatâ€™s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think itâ€™s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that thereâ€™s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didnâ€™t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because itâ€™s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they canâ€™t get it. And she said you know itâ€™s your fault that it went to Eilat.

However, I witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. Having flown Qatar airways throughout the years even on a Bahrain to Dubai flight via Doha, I was accustomed to high standards of service. The service from the crew was a letdown. I asked for a fruit platter and I was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. I mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice. Frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available, which I think he assumed I forgot. Each and every time I requested something I had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy. I even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same. The food itself was not up to the exquisite taste we come to associate with this travel. Obviously I would not know better because I was not able to try another statement dish. I have had better, personal and quicker service in A380 economy where a crew is bound to serve more then 300-400 passengers. I do think I would appreciate a more personal response and attention then a standard we are sorry to hear of your inconvenience and regret the same.

United Airlines,2.0,D Small,1st January 2017,"Flight #5953 - Kansas City snow storm of Dec. 17th. Flight was to depart at 5:22 pm. Delay, delay, delay then cancelled shortly before 8:00 pm. The lines of people at the gates were long and moving very slowly as people were trying to get other flights and airlines arrangements. At 8 pm an announcement that the agents at the gates had to leave for the day, as they had completed their shifts.....all hell broke loose as people began running from the lines out to the ticket counters in the terminal to be closer to the front of the long line. There was about 200 people in line for one agent. Other airline's planes were leaving, but not United's. It was communicated to the passengers that the one de-icing truck United had for Kansas City had broken a line and was inoperable. So, without de-icing, no flying. A neighboring airline had 4 de-icing trucks, however, three of those were broken so United couldn't borrow one. Really, in Kansas City, no contingent plan for snow other than one truck. Waiting in a line that wasn't moving, called customer service to reissue tickets on a different flight. We were told no planes were going to fly out the next day, Sunday, but they could get us on a Monday morning flight. The employee lied to get us off the phone and move on to someone else, by just scheduling us on an easy flight without having to do research of flights that would get us home sooner. However, we took the scheduling and headed to the bank of hotels to find a place for two nights. At the hotel we did our own rescheduling and found a flight for Sunday on another airline, American and Mesa through Phoenix, AZ, at 5:50 pm. These also, were delayed and finally left KC, MO at 8 pm. United's service is very poor, we did not get our upgraded seats we paid for, nor have they offered when we asked for compensation.

United Airlines,1.0,S Perrin,8th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Raleigh Durham. Flying United once again was a horrible experience. Even though a passing storm stopped several hours before the departure the outbound flight was cancelled. I had to go to a university to attend classes for one week and when I checked in on the rescheduled flight, the flight attendant made me check my luggage even though my luggage basically met the carry on requirement, which caused me to be late to my class though my rescheduled flight left at 6am and I had plenty of time to get to class by 9am. One the way back my flight was delayed 4 hours though only a 1.5 hour flight. Once I got back to my airport, because they made me check my luggage again, I was delayed another hour since the luggage were put into a room without alerting anyone. United airline operates giving zero consideration to the customer's time, paying good money. Their attitude seems to be """"we are doing you a favor"""". The attendants are rude and I have never flown out on time nor reached my destination on time. United new carry on baggage policy is a scam.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Doug Davis,9th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Where do I start? We started our journey from Florida and had a delay due to a storm warning. Typical I hear for Florida which is out of the airlines control I understand. That's where the understanding ends. Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is. Oh just to add, my flight home now my wife and I are in non connecting seats and the gate customer service couldn't ""print tickets"" so I had to write down all the information on our receipts from the previous night, she didn't even have the courtesy to do that for me.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Florida to Sacramento via Atlanta,2019-05-01 00:00:00,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no

Qatar Airways,3.0,Hugh Colton,20th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha. Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft. My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic. I was unimpressed with Qatar Airways and next year when we visit Bhutan we will use a different OneWorld carrier.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Doha to Atlanta,March 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no

As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me.

For some reason the A-C seats on row 44 on the 747-800 had about 1 decimeter less leg space than the other seats on the same row (and the rest of the plane). I have never been so cramped on an Intercontinental flight before (or any flight for that matter).,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,7.0,A Skidmore,17th September 2014,Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Aeromexico,10.0,Jacques Passy,28th October 2014,I had two flights with them in business class MEX-MAD and LHR-MEX. The Madrid flight was in a 777 and the London - Mexico flight was in a new 787. Completely different experience. They have substantially improved their food offering but now the crews have an excellent attitude in the way they treat the clients. The seat in the 777 is outdated as is the entertainment system but the 787 flat bed seat is a great quality seat. I can never sleep on planes and when I went up to the galley for a snack I found the cabin crew to be very friendly.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,yes

Lufthansa,9.0,James Wallace,13th June 2014,Munich to Chicago in Economy on an Airbus A340-600. Fasten seatbelt sign turned off five minutes after take-off and not put back on until 30 minutes before landing. Hot towels provided before lunch and after snack. Real tableware used with the lunch not plastic. Free alcohol provided before lunch wine with dinner and two choices of after dinner drinks provided. Five economy toilets were provided in the basement of the plane which was a nice stretch and avoided bad smells in the cabin. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. The seats are very tight luckily the seat next to me was empty. However the flight was nearly full.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
American Airlines,8.0,P Wipatavit,29th June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Short haul flight from Boston to Washington D.C.-Reagan on an A319. This was my first time flying any American airline and I had no expectations whatsoever. However, this flight was one of the best short-haul flights I've ever been on. Push back in Boston was on-time. Service was on par with a lot of other airlines, or even better. Seat width was more than the rumoured sardine can and seat pitch was generous for a narrow body plane. Slimline seats didn't bother me much",,,,,,,,,,,,

Delta Air Lines,,Linda Boumarafi,6th July 2014,My experience started in Chicago on a flight bound for Phoenix via Minneapolis and a weather delay in Minneapolis. The experience quickly went from bad to abysmal after being delayed in Chicago. The flight crew could not help anyone with connections in Minneapolis. Although it was still afternoon the 800 number people were unable to come up with any alternate route. After nearly 4 hours of delay which included all the passengers deplaning we were loaded onto the plane after the gate next to us with a later flight going Minneapolis loaded. My flight to Phoenix which had also been delayed due to weather left 30 minutes before I got there and had our flight gone first as it should have I probably would have made my connection. But the Delta personal were unable or unwilling to deal with passenger issues like this. Instead I bunked down in the Minneapolis airport overnight. Meals were not provided even though all the restaurants in the airport were closed or closing when we arrived. The next day after 27.5 hours of travel I arrived in Phoenix but one of my bags did not. So while I understand that weather happens this airline has an appalling lack of kindness consideration or concern about getting people and their luggage to their destination.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Lufthansa,10.0,Rajan Parrikar,19th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | San Francisco to Frankfurt in First Class. Lufthansa uses the United Global First Lounge at SFO, a pleasant, but unremarkable, space. Lufthansa's A380 First Class cabin has an 8-seat arrangement. I was in 1A, right in the front and on the second deck of the aircraft. Upon entry into the cabin each First Class passenger is given a personal locker to store carry-on luggage. The seat was extremely comfortable, with a modicum of privacy provided by an adjustable screen separator. Two spacious washrooms serviced the First Class cabin. Where Lufthansa's First Class product excelled was in its exceptional onboard service. The lady flight attendant assigned to me was highly professional and personable, anticipating my needs as the flight progressed. Turndown service with mattress and blanket was provided when I wanted to sleep. Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages there's nothing to add to on that front. As for the food, this is as good as it gets on a flight, but I like to eat light. After landing, I went to the excellent Lufthansa First Class Lounge at FRA, an oasis of calm, and after a relaxing couple of hours was driven in a limousine via the tarmac directly to my outbound aircraft.",A380,Solo Leisure,First Class,SFO to FRA,August 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Air Canada,10.0,H Ding,8th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | A great flight from Air Canada, returning from Frankfurt to Calgary in premium economy. The majority of my recent flights have been on AC (also flown WestJet, EasyJet, and Lufthansa, I've found that AC compares favourably). Getting on board on this flight, I let my clean-obsession take over. If there was something out of place or noticeably dirty on or around my seat, I'd notice. But everything was neat, tidy and clean. The flight was on time. The cabin crew on AC is usually friendly, but this time I was struck by just how pleasant they were: My request for an extra meal (it was a 21-hour-long travel day for me) was immediately accommodated. The attendant came around in good time and offered more wine to the cabin without people even asking. When I missed the second meal (breakfast wraps) because I was asleep, the attendant brought me two servings to make up for it. When I asked for coffee, the attendant brought a handful of something, saying: 'I didn't know if you wanted sugar-and-cream or Baileys, so I brought both - choose wisely! I chose wisely and went with Baileys - and I'll choose Air Canada again because believe it or not, this kind of service and friendliness is pretty typical on most flights, and I've flown with them on countless times. There have been delays, but nothing not related to weather or maintenance",,,,,,,,,,,,
Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5.0,T Hume,16th August 2012,PVG-SVO-AMS. Got the lowest price available by a long way so wasn't expecting too much. The flight from PVG-SVO was at 1.40am - the new planes apparently are on the earlier route so the plane was very spartan with shared TVs which showed one film throughout the whole journey. Staff were so serious that it was quite comical (does it hurt to smile?). SVO-AMS was again on a very basic plane this time with no TVs at all but at least the staff were nicer despite very poor English.

I wasnâ€™t told it was Emirates policy that they assess every passengerâ€™s hand luggage including items bought at the airport before you board the plane. The 7kg allowance prior to departure in London was more due to my duty-free shopping. I was told by the ground floor supervisor/manager that I have to reduce the weight of my hand luggage or pay $200 for extra weight or return my duty-free shopping but I refused to do so. If I donâ€™t pay $200 or reduce the weight I would not be allowed to board the plane.

American Airlines,2.0,D Tong,16th August 2015,"On hold for 20-30 min about my missing checked luggage at this writing. My miserable experience began with their two competing online sites - one to make reservation thereafter just to be told to use other site to select seats, asking me for a ""locator"" code which wasn't given in the first instance. After much struggles and hassles connecting by phone with life agent adding a child to my travelling party, and entering payment info, screen got stuck at ""please wait a moment while processing etc"" through the night. Next morning I finally woke up to the idea of installing their Android app on my smart phone. When at long last I managed to reach the seating plan, the two last remaining economy seats I selected were no more and I was left with having to pay extra for the extra legroom seats. Upon boarding I was appalled by the aged aircraft and obsolete amenities. No individual screens, no plug-ins for phones, not even basic earphones provided unless you pay $5. Both featured movies were 2nd rate and displayed on some heavy CRT suspended units which emitted a very annoying glare during the red-eye flight. The extra legroom was not worthwhile or all that noticeable, as an equally crucial attribute was the lateral tightness of the seats which caused the usual shoulder-rubbing and sleeplessness. It was all-in-all was a strange throw-back to the 70s. For a flight of such duration, there was only one serving of drinks but even then, no snack of any sort. There were no pillows, but some left-over garbage from an earlier flight in the seat pocket. I arrived at baggage claim before others and there was a very long interlude for belt to start moving. Eventually after a prolonged and futile watch, my checked luggage was never forthcoming so I headed to their baggage service to report missing luggage. Luckily agent was helpful and wait wasn't long to write up the delayed baggage claim. However I was perturbed by the sheer number of displaced/delayed baggage affecting over hundred other passengers. An agent finally picked up my call after 35 minutes wait. Their online baggage status still has no update on my luggage where-about. Agent could not give any reason why, despite luggage was being checked over an hour and a half prior to flight departure.",Boeing 757,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Los Angeles,August 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,no

Emirates,7.0,T Mark,28th August 2014,"I recently flew from Singapore to Melbourne on a Boeing 777. On the plus side the fare was extremely cheap - $79 for a round trip ticket. The food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable - especially the selection of movies. It was an overnight flight though so I didn't use the system much. The cabin mood lighting during ""sleep"" periods was also relaxing. On the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and I could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. Admittedly I was travelling in Economy class but I have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. Unfortunately the Emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and I was only able to doze fitfully. The other thing I was disappointed with was the service. Emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events (such as meals DFS etc). I used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. However they did not do so.

The American gate next to it, had 5 employees, talking, laughing, not doing anything. I went over to them and asked if they could help me. I had been in my line for 30 minutes and the employee had only gotten through 2 people! So you can imagine the anger of everyone in line! The 5 employees at the adjacent gate said they couldn't help and really didn't seem to care enough to walk over to our gate to help that 1 lone employee.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Donna Holzhauser,8th February 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | Atlanta to Mexico City. We originally booked a flight from BWI to Merida Mexico for my godson's wedding. Delta canceled the flight and a representative from Delta rebooked us on a flight from BWI to Atlanta to Mexico city to merida. When we checked our flight the night before we joked that Delta was offering up to $500 to give up your seat. It was imperative for us to be in Merida by 5 pm for the rehearsal and dinner so that was not an option. On the leg of the flight from Atlanta to mexico city we only had a half hour to get from terminal A to terminal F. Atlanta is a large airport and we had to get from one side to the other. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes prior to departure. The delta rep at the gate said our seats had been sold and we needed to get on another flight. The next flight to Mexico city wasnt until 4 hours later and the flight from mexico city was also much later. Long story short we did not arrive in Merida until 230 am the next day.

United Airlines,8.0,Nate Reich,8th July 2015,"Check-in at Boston went smoothly and the plane boarded on time. I enjoyed using the free personal device entertainment United offers on their Airbus aircraft. While waiting at Newark Liberty for my next flight to Chicago, I was notified two hours before take off that my plane would be delayed and I would miss my final flight to Appleton. I was quickly placed on stand-by for another flight to Chicago, but soon realized I would not be able to get on that flight, as others were trying to fly stand-by as well. I had to take my original flight, which was delayed three hours, due to the fact that the aircraft was coming from Dallas and was delayed due to storms. I missed my original flight to Appleton, so was booked on a later one. In all, I spent about 15 hours on planes and in airports. It was a long day, but except for one customer service representative at Newark, who acted as if I was an inconvenience, every other United employee I dealt with was kind and helpful.","A319, Boeing 737-800, ERJ 145",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Boston to Appleton, WI via Newark, O'Hare",July 2015,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,10.0,Gummers David,18th June 2014,Emirates has got to be the best value for money for any premium carrier. The pick up from home is excellent they will take you to an airport hotel the night before. Check in was friendly quick and efficient. The lounges in Manchester and Dubai are lovely and peaceful. The food was good and the Wifi works. We will gloss over the Bidvest lounge in Cape Town. The suite has everything you could possibly want. The seat have everything from upright to completely flat. The food was absolutely first class the wines were excellent and the service from the crew was attentive and friendly.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Emirates,3.0,C Sireesha,22nd October 2014,LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet? Be prepared for the most unfriendly airport staff you will ever come across. No smile angry replies. Have a good flight if you are considering this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,no
Emirates,10.0,R Borneck,27th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Zurich to Melbourne via Dubai. I was punctually picked-up by the chauffeur drive service, and had a smooth check-in and quick transfer through customs & security to the lounge. Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by a very friendly and helpful cabin crew. The crew was very attentive and provided excellent service throughout a full and very busy flight. My window seat was very comfortable with lots of legroom and also a small little mini bar with soft drinks, which were replenished throughout the flight. The food offered on board was excellent and Emirates' wine list is of very high quality. Both food and wine offerings were very generous. The inflight entertainment system is the best and has a fantastic selection of movies, shows and music. The A380 is a wonderful plane to fly in, very quiet, spacious and the bar of course is one of the highlights. Overall, I had a great flight. After a 3 hour break I was due to board the connecting flight to Melbourne. Fog in Dubai though caused a delay but we were kept well informed by ground staff and once boarding started it was smooth. The A380 cabin as well as the service in this very busy flight (full business class) was again fabulous. Maybe just something trivial, but I loved that one could adjust the window blinds individually by pressing the respective buttons. The free inflight wifi in business class is brilliant and I enjoyed keeping in touch with friends along the trip. I managed to sleep for most of the flight and after a light breakfast (there are various breakfast options available, I decided to choose the lightest version) we landing in Melbourne.",A380-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Melbourne via Dubai,October 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

The staff didn't keep trying to flog us duty free goods which is always a bonus. However our return journey on 18th July wasn't so good. Poor entertainment with very limited choice and screens the size of postage stamps with no device charging facilities. Not everyone wants to sleep on a night flight. Also the hot meal was dreadful.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,Brian Robinson,12th October 2014,Flew GSO-ATL-SLC-PHX/ LAS-DTW-GSO on a paid First Class ticket - cost only 30% more than the coach ticket and well worth it. DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat. When will the airlines fulfil their promise of dumping these dogs altogether rather than just moving them from one fleet to another?

Air Canada,8.0,Kevan Peters,15th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Vancouver - London Heathrow return. Nov 1-13, 2017. Overall, very good experience. Online check-in easy and quick with very easy printing of boarding passes and luggage tags at the airport kiosks. Ground staff professional. The zone boarding process can be confusing as, even though specific zones are called, passengers from other zones tend to get into line prior to being called. Ground staff don't seem to manage this boarding process well and this is not the first trip where I've encountered this issue. Planes were clean and well kept. Onboard staff were professional and efficient. Meals were tasty, which was a vast improvement over my last international trip with AC. Vancouver - London Heathrow included 1 hot meal and a very small breakfast - a slice of gingerbread and a small yogurt. This is not sufficient for a flight almost 10 hours long. London Heathrow - Vancouver included a hot meal, mid flight snack and then a hot fajita about 1.5 hours prior to landing. Frequent drink runs both flights. Overall, onboard service was efficient and well done, but not outstanding. Seats are reasonable but not overly comfortable. Onboard entertainment system worked very well both flights and there was a good variety of TV, movies and music. The only negative comment would be that AC charges for advance seat selection on Tango fares, fares are high enough without adding this extra fee.

Alitalia,10.0,Alexandr Choi,15th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Alitalia exceeded my expectations for my flight to Miami from Rome. The flight attendants were professional, on time to refill glasses with beverages and offer any additional help. We had a mess-up with the seats during the check-in, and would have ended up seating separately, however the flight attendants managed to rearrange the seats and put us together. It is worth noting that almost every couple in business class had a mess-up with the seats, therefore, kudos to the crew for their effort to rearrange the seating. We were presented with a Bvlgari flight kit. The business class cabin is very stylish, seats recline to a flat bed, and extremely comfortable. A330-200 only 6 years old and the cabin felt fresh and not beaten up. Bathrooms were nice. TV Screens are big and the menu easy to navigate. The food and beverage service was impressive. We were served amazing restaurant quality fish and beef with wonderful tomato pasta with basil, accompanied by Italian wines and other spirits. Also an assortment of Italian cheeses and desserts, cappuccino and chocolates. The rest of the flight we managed to get 4-5 hours of sleep. We were served snacks prior to our descent to Miami. During the snack my wife's entertainment system froze. The flight attendant tried to revive it, but the screen would not turn back on. About 40 minutes later, the same flight attendant approached us with deep apologies and gave a voucher for 150 euros credit towards the purchase of a future ticket with Alitalia.",A330-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,FCO to MIA,August 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes

The groud service in Miami checked our bags even though you were supposed to do it on your own at a digital kiosk. When I boarded I didn't find a toothbrush set on my seat which is very disappointing on an overnight flight. The legroom was amazing, and that's what you expect when flying Main Cabin Extra. The seats were a bit wider than in normal Economy but didn't recline enough. They weren't as comfortable as the soft and comfy BA B747 ones and I wasn't able to sleep at all. The IFE was good with a huge range of music, many TV shows, and a adequate music on- demand radio choice. The power outlets were universal and it charged fast unlike the USB plug of the IFE. The service was good and kind, provided 3 drinks but you can ask them anytime to give you another one. The meal (I chose pasta) was pretty good, and came with a salad with dressing, a bun, crackers, cheddar, butter and a brownie. The breakfast was a fat free strawberry yougurt, a little bag of cereal for the yogurt, a cranberry snack and a flat over-processed muffin.

A330 is a nice aircraft, small business class section with comfortable seats, decent selection of movies, food very good as usual on Qatar.

Much bigger business section with 48 seats, very comfortable but strange seats no arm rest of the left hand side until you reclined the seat. Good flight, again managed to sleep for a short time before arriving at Bangkok. Return flights just as good despite an 8 hours transit in Doha (more about that in the lounge review) I always get messed up with the different Airbus A330 models but the one from Doha to Manchester was different from the first flight, looked a little older and smaller. I canâ€™t praise the Qatar crews on all four flights enough, brilliant service with maybe the best food on any airline.

They did asked if you would like a drink, but you would have to ask exactly what was on offer as no more information was forthcoming. The worst part was the lack of water being offered on board. They came around twice to offer a cup of water and I found that I became very dehydrated. Even though there is a water cooler near the toilets (which I didn't know about at the time) it was almost impossible to get out of my seat as I was in the middle and my companion was asleep.

While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude.

Air Canada,7.0,M Charson,8th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s!

To make us even more mad, they said ""if it was one of you we could do it, but not for a family."" So, I can only conclude that Delta hates families? Or they're just lazy? I'm mad that I have to sit in the airport for 6 more hours. How is Delta so stupid? Now there are less seats on the later flight to possibly sell, and they just chose to anger five international travelers who have families of their own.

Booked economy and got upgraded to Business upon check-in for the CDG-AMS segment. Was initially told they wouldn't be able to provide a meal at check-in and was told again once on-board by an apologetic AF rep who got onboard to inform me personally that there wouldn't be a meal for me. Ended up being served an AF meal which was nice as I didn't expect anything. Some passengers were served a KLM meal while others were served an AF meal which seemed strange somehow and created some confusion with the crew.

Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didnâ€™t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, itâ€™s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to itâ€™s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldnâ€™t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldnâ€™t even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers. I will never ever fly them again - hell they are not even the cheapest, just spend that few extra hundred to be on Emirates or other more reputable airline.

From the moment I was in line at Houston IAH to head to my destination, to my return to Houston, the people that represent AA lacked customer service skills. The officer reviewing passports at IAH was extremely rude and sarcastic to every person that went through her line. She talked down to paying passengers with no provocation from them. She was making it clear to passengers that she had been there since 2:30 am. Perhaps she needs to find another position more suited to her so that she does not take out her displeasure with her work schedule on paying and unsuspecting passengers. On my return flight, my bag did not arrive on the same plane as I had. It was delivered the next day. At home when I opened my suitcase, I noticed that I was missing a bag of clothes.

Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no

A request to upgrade for business cabin was denied. On the ground at Ataturk a long and very slow line-up in the corridor just to enter the gate (an additional security check - we have gone through the passport control as well as the security already). Not a single seat available. The security agents behaved like Canadian immigration officials interrogating people about purposes of their trips but no information was going into computers. Younger people were sitting on the floor older ones standing there with their bags looked tortured already. The plane was jammed full.

The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

American Airlines,1.0,Michael Rojek,22nd February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Honolulu to Los Angeles. I attempted to check in online 18 hours prior to my flight. For whatever reason, the system processed mine but not my wife's. Since in the inbound flight we weren't seated together, I wanted to rectify this. I called AA and the first agent who answered immediately suggested it was my fault because I ""didn't check a box or something"". I suggested he first listen to me and run my record locator. All I wanted to do was ensure me. And my wife sat together this time. When he did, he said this is an issue with British Airways since they issued the ticket. I said that's impossible, because BA doesn't handle check in for flights on AA. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told to call BA or they could put me in touch with their website tech support (why?). Both the initial agent as well as the supervisor were incredibly rude and appeared to be doing whatever possible to get me off the line. I called BA. The agent, Dev, went above and beyond what could possibly be expected, and stayed with me for an hour to help. I explained what happened and he told me they're ""giving you the run around"" because, of course, BA doesn't handle check in for domestic AA flights. He offered to call AA for me and we were on a conference call. The supervisor he spoke to informed him that there was an issue with the passport info. He asked them to change the info and complete checkin and was told that was impossible. He said he knows for a fact it isn't, and it happens all the time. Since checkin wasn't my issue, but seating, he suggested my wife simply be given a seat next to me and she would complete checkin at the airport. The AA supervisor said that, too, was impossible. Until she's checked in, they can't assign a seat. Once again, the BA agent explained that this is impossible and he has lists of policies and regulations, not to mention previous experience. The AA supervisor hung up on him mid sentence. He apologized profusely and said he never experienced anything like this. We called again, and the agent we got this time was just as unhelpful and refused to do anything, but was at least pleasant. She suggested I pay to select my wife's seat, because next to me there is an empty one. The BA agent again asked why they can't assign it to her, it's within 24 hours of the flight. No. They won't assign it, they won't fix her checkin, but they're happy to SELL the seat. At this point in my frustration I said fine, I'll buy it. $50 additional fee if the agent takes my payment. Both me and the BA agent were at a loss for words. I ended up going online to buy the seat next to me for my wife, with Dev and the AA supervisor on hand to confirm it went through. AA succeeded in ruining my last day in Honolulu and wasting 2 hours of my time in order to squeeze even more money out of me. I would have thought that would be it, but upon arrival at Heathrow, I learned my bags didn't make the flight (2hr layover at LAX). This airline is an absolute joke, with complete disregard for passengers. Even the discount carriers treat you better. BA offered a black and white comparison between how an airline should behave and how it shouldn't. Dev was apologizing for things that weren't his fault, stayed with me until the end, whereas AA staff were aggressive and condescending, and even hung up on their British colleague.

American Airlines,2.0,Raghav Nookala,16th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew American Airlines on business trips domestic and international numerous times but never with family on an intentional trip. Unfortunately I did travel this time and I swear not to do the same mistake again. I wanted to request a vegetarian meal for my family and I could not figure how to do it from the website that I visit almost every week. I end up calling customer service and they had to update the meal preference. However they miss updating one of the family members and guess what, 2 Asian vegetarian meals for 3 of us. I was traveling with an infant, so requested a bassinet almost 2 months in advance. Even called the customer service and I get a standard response that I need to request at the airport. I am a platinum pro traveler and I still could not block any bulkhead rows because I had a lap child in the reservation. I go to the airport 3.5 hours before the departure time and request bassinet. I was told that I need to contact the gate agent. I go ask the gate agent and she tells me that no bulk head seats are available as all of those seats were sold at a premium to other passengers. When I checked out those seats, there were no infants in them. This was a shocker. My next 2 legs were with Etihad and they had the bulk head rows assigned to us even before requesting them. The air hostesses were arrogant and would not like to entertain simple questions like â€œhey do have some fruits for the kids?â€ I specifically asked for the name to complain and she would not divulge her name. A simple yes or know would have sufficed but all I get is ""Why are you bothering me"" look. This kind of behavior deters families traveling with American and could cost in the long run. No point in whining about Middle East airlines capturing the international travel market. Not because of their price but because of their service.

Air Canada,1.0,John Apuzzo,6th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I have flown Air Canada many times and was generally satisfied with their service, yet my last trip was less than to be desired. My flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by more than 5 hours. The company stated the cargo door was broken when unloading merchandise. When we finally boarded we were not told we were to land first in St John's Canada to have a pilot change. They should have left us in Paris and resume normal schedules hours albeit a day late, yet to add to this when the flight left St John's to arrive in Toronto, we were met at the Toronto airport by gate agents ready with hotel vouchers and new boarding passes for a flight to LAX the day after. I was told because the flight from Paris into Toronto landed after 9:00 PM there were no more flights into the US (we had landed a little past 10:00 PM). I went to the hotel where the shuttle took over an hour to arrive to pick us up after several calls to the front desk letting them know we were waiting (you would think the airline would have this a little more coordinated). Well by the time I got to the hotel it was midnight and I had to get up by 5:00 AM to catch the flight from Toronto to Los Angeles. Arriving at the airport at 5:45 AM I was told the flight to Los Angeles was delayed by one hour and 45 minutes so instead of leaving at 8:05 AM the flight now left at 9:45 AM. To add to the ordeal there also was a medical emergency on the flight to LAX, they flight had to understandably stay at the gate while paramedics attended to the patient. We finally land at Los Angeles a little before 11:00 AM only to find out my luggage did not make the flight. How can the luggage not make the flight when I was over 4 hours early checking in? (got to the airport 3 hours early for international flight and over 1 hour delayed flight - clearly they had plenty of time to verify and check the luggage). The personnel indicated to go to the Air Canada website to track luggage. Website provides little to no information. Basically has what I told them at the baggage claim at LAX yet does not track where the luggage is at. After calling the agent at LAX, I was told my luggage landed at 5:00 pm.. I was told the delivery company has 24 hours to deliver me my bag. Not only am I jet lagged from being in Europe I am told to stay up to be in receipt of my lost (now found mis-tagged bag). I am still waiting for my bag 12 hours after it supposedly arrived in Los Angeles.",Boeing 787,Business,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles via Toronto,September 2018,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,7.0,Jos Gobbels,28th August 2015,"I was a little bit concerned of booking on UA after reading some of the reviews. No reason for concern, however. Took a flight from Amsterdam to Houston with a connection to Salt Lake City. Flew back from San Diego to Houston with connection to Amsterdam. Legroom on the domestic US flights a bit limited but no complaints while flying over the Atlantic. Had an almost two hour delay on the flight from Houston to Amsterdam of which we where informed already quite early and about which we received several updates. Made up some of the time during the flight. Cabin staff were friendly and catered to all of our needs with no exception. Food and drinks in adequate quantity.

Lufthansa,7.0,M Kronz,24th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | We flew Lufthansa Business Class from Munich to Barcelona on January 8, 2017. Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didnÂ´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasnÂ´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesnÂ´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didnÂ´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean. Flight announcements were sufficient and comprehensible and came in four languages. All in all, I would recommend flying LH business class on European routes, and I would recommend that LH improve their ground services in MUC.",A321,Family Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Barcelona,January 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes

I got mine for free as I am platinum with Air France, however otherwise it would have cost US$150 and consequently I imagine those that did pay would have been outraged that staff allowed people to move to vacant exit seats after take off. The meal was satisfactory and probably above average for airline food. Entertainment system very old, but a couple of good films so job done I guess.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,C Plumber,21st July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Detroit to Tampa. Recently I decided to start using Delta Airlines. It was a fairly last minute trip so I scheduled a flight from Detroit to Tampa and paid around $450. I scheduled the 8:20 PM because I didn't know what time I would be done with work. It turned out my assignment ended early so I got to the airport at 1PM to try to get on a 3:30PM flight. At first I was informed there would be a $75 fee to change to the earlier flight which was fine with me and well worth it. Then after looking up my fare the Delta employee told me that I could not change the flight because I had an economy fare. The only option was to buy a new ticket for close to $500 on the 3:30 flight. I asked if I could go standby they said no. I asked if there was anything I could do to get on the earlier flight short of paying another full fare. They said ""sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can."" So the 3:30 flight was delayed until 4:45. I hung around hoping I could get on the flight. I tried again and Delta said that if the 8:20 is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight. I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed - sorry. Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats. The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it. The flight left. Not 10 minutes goes by and I get an email saying the 8:20 is delayed. Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers. They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra $75 but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another 4 hours. My flight has been delayed to 8:45 and I am betting it will be later than that. Fly Southwest - they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,L Byrne,12th February 2015,JFK-IST-DHA and return in Jan 15. Be advised that planes have no individual ventilation system and were unexpectedly quite warm on all segments. The planes on all segments were dirty. Leaving Istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked. There was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! There was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers. On US legs the staff were merely uninterested. On the Dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude. Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements. The lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited 3-4 hours outside the airport for a TA transfer to a hotel. Those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful TA rep to no avail. Never again. I will pay the extra for Emirates.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no

American Airlines,2.0,A Goddard,17th March 2015,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside.

Seat width was fine and meals were just above the average for economy class Would recommend Emirates economy for a competitive price and decent service as long as you remember if you want top shelf seats and service to fly business or first! Wifi service is non existent/very hard to connect to in DXB which isn't an emirates thing but does reflect on them as it's their home airport.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes
United Airlines,1.0,Anne Shauan,25th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Bozeman to Tampa via Houston. United Airlines has to be by far the worst airline ever.  They nickel and dime you for everything and then do not provide what you paid for.  Every employee/representative states""there's nothing I could do (for their own mistake and situation they have created).  Paid extra per passenger to be able to pre-select my seats and guarantee that I would sit with my husband for our long flights (I have developed anxiety with flying).  Paid for my checked bags when booking my flights. I check in to my flight the evening before my flight,  since I do not bring a printer on vacation,  I chose electronic boarding passes.  All info was good, name, correct flight and bags. Once at the airport, an agent told me we had re-check in to get out luggage tags.  We insisted that we were already checked-in with luggage paid for.   She made us use the kiosk, and when I checked in, my name was changed to 'Olivia'.  So now my boarding pass does not match my ID, and they were charging us again for bags I already paid for.  At the counter, a call was placed to United by the ticket agent about the name change.  The person at the other end of the phone stated that another agent had been in my record earlier that day.  That agent denied changing my record.  My name was corrected, a new boarding pass issued,  but no seat assigned.  When we got to the gate, they re-assigned me to s seat different than the one I had paid extra to select at booking, and I was no longer sitting with my husband.  We asked to get my seat back that was assigned to me 45 minutes earlier, but they could not because my original seat was given away. Once on the plane, the bitch who got the seat with my husband would not move.  I ended up in the aisle seat in the last row....by the bathrooms in a seat that does not recline. To top it off, instead of offering to help, the flight attendant told me she was going to escort me off the flight for being upset. United airlines charges over the top prices, charge for everything and do not provide service.  Staff is rude, not helpful and are trained to answer ""there is nothing I can do"".  The bottom line is:  I will take your money, not provided what you paid for, be unhelpful and rude to you.  Then, you are held hostage and threatened to be taken off your flight when you let then know you want what you paid for. United -Tampa to Bozeman MT: $1500 for 2.  Extra charge for seat selection and bags. Delta- Tampa to SLC: $700 for 2. Extra charge for seat selection and luggage. American - Tampa to Syracuse: $490  for 2.  No extra charge for seat selection. United Airlines is a rip-off with very poor accountability and customer service.  Will pay more with another airline next time.  Very disappointed and United will not fix this. I feel like I was robbed. They do not care about the paying customer once you have given them your money. We will never fly with them again.

There was at least a 75 minute delay out of MEL. I think this is to do with day-light saving time (1hr) in MEL plus a bit more. I think it is the airlines responsibility to adjust and advertise the correct departure times in cases such as this.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Michael Asher,1st July 2014,Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either.

I realize that Virgin America is a low cost no frills carrier with a modern flair but the flight attendants on duty that day should take a lesson from the charming pilots heading the flight by at least cracking a smile and welcoming passengers on board rather than avoiding eye contact and appearing preoccupied with personal concerns.

QR flight to KUL had arrived ahead of schedule and was looking forward to an on time departure. After sitting on the plane for over 1 hr already, were absolutely amazed by the Qatar policy to let people board the plane still 50 minutes after departure time (9.45 am and 10.35), people were simply late and kept other passengers waiting on this Sunday morning - very good weather and no traffic problems in KUL. Why on earth do they start boarding the aircraft before 9 am when they let people board until 10.35 way behind the schedule? Having known this, we would have slept 1Â½ hrs longer as well.

Unfortunately, this flight was worse in several areas than the usual quality experience on QR: delayed boarding that was simply unacceptable, tight seating 3-4-3 with good 33"" seat pitch though, mediocre food and small portions and the general feeling of being cramped on board. The mid-flight snacks could be healthier as well: always white bread which is far too sweet, very sweet cakes or crisps - 6/10 only. DOH - TXL on A333 the same Sunday afternoon was another story: excellent boarding with on-time departure from DOH, pleasant and highly motivated cabin crew, three options for lunch (beef-chicken-vegetarian), water and juices served three-four times during the flight and an early arrival at TXL. The meal service was exemplary with two + two carts in economy plus one hostess serving the last five-six rows from the rear galley, which seemed fast & efficient.

Delta Air Lines,5.0,K Sheares,3rd November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience.",Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Tampa via Atlanta,October 2017,2.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,3.0,no

Business class on Qatar is, for example, certainly more than the equivalence of BA's first class. And at significant cost reductions. Part of it is the staff, you just don't get the level of service orientation on European airlines like BA and Lufthansa. Its like there is no motivation to go beyond the standard, drummed in training they've done a hundred times. You know those adverts where you see the service crew gently put a blanket on a sleeping guest? I had assumed that was rubbish, it had never happened to me. Well it did with Qatar! One of the staff even made a personal plan to get an out of stock duty free item to me! Unreal stuff. Or maybe this is how it should be?

Me and my wife were issued just the boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow, while my son (2.5 years old) got boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow and Istanbul to Abuja. When I complained they said don't worry, jut pick it up when you get to Istanbul. We arrived Istanbul and someone from Turkish Airlines was announcing to us that passengers transiting to Abuja should go to the boarding gate immediately - we complained that we were not given boarding pass in Heathrow and the guy said go upstairs. We got upstairs at the Turkish Airlines desk told them we need boarding pass. After waiting for about 2 mins, I noticed the lady had a strange look on her face, unfortunately they don't speak good English, so off she went came back after about 2 minutes with someone who flatly told us, sorry you cannot board that plane. I asked him why, he said the plane has departed. He said the option we have is to either spend 48 hours in a Hotel in Istanbul, they'll take care of our hotel bills and food or we go via Egyptair that has a 6 hours wait in Istanbul, 8 hours wait in Cairo and a total of about 8 hours flight. We spent 6 hours wait time on a cold metal chair in Istanbul and 8 hours in Cairo. After a combined 8 hours flight from Istanbul to Abuja via Cairo, we finally arrived Abuja. We got to Abuja but all my checked in luggage could not be found. 5 days after arriving Abuja Turkish airline is telling me its the responsibility of Egyptair to find my luggage not theirs.

The 2 staff serving the completely full main cabin seemed tired and stressed. Food and drinks service took hours into the flight and many options were out by the time it finally got to the back of the cabin. The attendants were forgetful about what we'd ordered.

Emirates,9.0,Matthew Hunter,21st January 2016,"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front.

We dropped a couple of feet which was scary but the EK staff kept us calm and served us refreshments after the turbulence had past. Just before we were about to descend into Johannesburg we were diverted to Durban due to bad weather in JNB. We were in Durban for 2 hours but we weren't allowed off the plane.

QR have serious communication issues when it comes to being delayed and all flights (except the one leaving BKK) were delayed by at least 40 minutes if not more. Hamad international airport was nice and new but unfortunately very chaotic if you have a tight connection. Food was probably the best thing on QR - quite tasty for airline food! FA's really varied on each leg - some were just sitting/standing around chatting amongst themselves and were clearly not interested in customer service whereas others tried their best to deliver. Inflight entertainment was pretty good on 777s. Plenty to choose from but pretty much the same film/TV choices a month later and remote control on A340 stiff and unresponsive. Seats were a little on the uncomfortable side though lots of legroom compared to other carriers. The 2-4-2 config on the A340 definitely suited my companion and I more than the 777's 3-3-3 layout.

If it was a bad thing, I couldn't sit beside my wife who I was also on this trip, so I sat behind her on the right side of the plane. To sit kinda beside is taking an isle seat but it's no window seat, plus because the pods are positioned in the pod style, being comfortable in your chair would be hard to chit chat to your traveling partner, so it's down to preference. Food was great, and the drinks were non stop. The bed was 180 degree flat bed and comfortable. There were no PJ's provided like other airlines. I am 6ft 2 and did not find it cramped and sleeping was no problem. I did read reviews in advanced that sitting in the last back seat of each section of Business, provides a bit more storage space, and it was true. So if you book in advanced and select your seat, try for these. But overall, no complaints. The flight was spacious, pods give that cozy effect.

Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing.

Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one.

I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue.

Then they refused to let us sit together, on any of our flights, luckily there was one person who offered to switch seats. They acted like because we paid for the cheaper seats thatâ€™s how we were gonna be treated. We couldnâ€™t even take a carry on with our flight it was just ridiculous. We flew Delta a little less than a year before this and paid for the same type of ticket and when we asked if we could sit next to each other they said no problem at all and allowed us to have a carry on.

It appears that AC flight attendants hate their job and are only too pleased to show this to the passengers. On the first flight one of the attendants was barely civil. Return flight a repeat performance with a different attendant. At boarding time I wondered why no attendant was welcoming passengers or being helpful at the rear of the plane where we were seated. An attendant was there alright seated in her position and doing absolutely nothing. During the flight she managed to serve the drinks before sitting down in the last row to read eat and watch a movie. Her colleague was somewhat more professional. I am wondering however what has happened to civility to say nothing of service. These people don't seem to understand that they are there for the passengers not the other way around. One sees nothing like it on the other major Canadian airline in Europe or in Asia where flight attendants still consider friendliness and service as part of their job.

The problem was we were not informed that our flight was delayed while standing in the line. The board showed our flight to be on time. Needless to say we stood for over 2 hours in line and were late to board our plane. Then told our plane was delayed. No help was offered while we were in the line only told we would have to wait our turn. Ended up flying into Toronto later that day but missed our connecting flight to Nashville. Thankfully Air Canada paid for our hotel and part of our supper in Toronto. On our return we were on schedule coming into Toronto according to our tickets. But when we had gone through customs and were ready recheck our bags to get the connecting flight to Winnipeg we were told we were too late as the baggage had to be checked in 1 hour in advance of the next flight. No effort to get us on the original flight. Thankfully I had enough time after landing in Winnipeg that I could still drive home. The service we got at the airports was just appalling.

The manager then stated it was my fault for not checking that my flight hadn't changed. He said it was not United's policy to notify people when the flights change, in this case, bringing it forward 1 hour. They could not then get me another direct flight, so now instead of being in Vancouver at 10am it'll be closer to 4pm.

Paid $60 in advance for a preferred seat 18K which was worth every penny. Tons of legroom. My first time on a 787 and it was very impressive. Excellent features and very quiet. Flight Attendants very well groomed, friendly and efficient. I do find it annoying that on a four hour North American flight on a full service airline that the only food offering is buy onboard. However, having said that the pricing and quality of the items cannot be faulted. I prepaid for a meal and snack voucher for $7 Canadian. For that I choose a Swiss cheese / crackers package which had a very generous offering of cheese with it, and a delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye with pickles. It would have cost more than that just about anywhere else. Buying it in advance is quite a saving over the listed prices and the flight crew knew I had done so and offered up choices in advance before things ran out.

Delta Air Lines,,Julia Mulligan,1st June 2015,I have chosen Delta for years because of it was the best one but lately it's service has been so terrible that I will never fly with them again. Twice now I have flown out of Detroit and there have been problems that have delayed the flight to our next location (I understand that problems happen) but while we were on our flight I was very thirsty and asked the stewardess for a glass of water and she said the cart would be by shortly - the cart skipped our whole section and when I tried to stop the flight attendant again I was ignored - I didn't see the attendants for the rest of the flight. When we arrived at Atlanta to switch to our next flight we had missed our flight. The first time no one would help me - I must have talked to at least 10 people before finding someone that rudely told me to go to a certain gate and wait and that I might make it onto that flight. This time I went to the gate and they told us the plane had just left (the plane was not suppose to leave Atlanta until 12.50 I was at the gate at 12.40) and when I asked where do I go to get another flight I was ignored and they walked away. I then went to the information and was told to go to a gate that had no one at it - no one! I then went back and was rudely sent to another gate where I was told they didn't know if they had a seat available for me. After an hour I was able to get a flight home.

American Airlines,1.0,P Kealy,9th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. This entire trip was one nightmare after another. On my outbound flight, I sat in the plane at the gate for over 2 hours for a maintenance issue involving some kind of latch in the cargo area. That was frustrating, but I would prefer the plane be safe prior to takeoff, so I accepted it and moved on. My return trip was one issue after another. I was notified of a 2 hour delay about 5 hours prior to the scheduled departure time. While I was never given a formal reason for this original delay, it was suspected to be as a result of weather in other parts of the country. I was understanding but still needed to know how to handle the ticket for my missed connection flight. The attendant at the desk advised me to still remain on this flight and the connection ticket would be handled for me once it was ""officially missed."" I did so and continued waiting. The plane was delayed for a little longer than originally planned but it did finally arrive at the airport. Unfortunately, yet another plane had maintenance issues and the delay was extended by another 1.5 hours for them to check it out. The departure time was 4 hours and 17 minutes late. I had been rescheduled onto several intermediate flights but, ultimately, missed all connections due to another delay upon arrive at DFW - we were not able to get to a gate so we were waiting in the holding box for an additional 20 minutes. I was finally booked onto the last flight between Dallas and Houston for the night, so I went to the gate to wait the 1.5 hours. While waiting, the flight was ""delayed"" by 30 minutes, and the shortly after that announcement, it was cancelled altogether. After waiting in line at the AA customer service desk for 30 minutes, I was informed that they had not scheduled a flight crew for that flight, which is why it was cancelled. So I had to be put up in a hotel and fly out the following morning. The airline dropped the ball in numerous ways, but the poor state of their planes is the most concerning. I finally contacted them after it was all finished and requested compensation for the nightmare that I went through and the airline offered me a $100 ""goodwill"" voucher to fly American again in the next 12 months. I do not accept that as sufficient compensation so I continued emailing back and forth, ultimately ending with a phone call from corporate customer relations saying that this was all that I was entitled to since they provided the service that I paid for - a flight between the two destinations. I am shocked that multiple delays and hours spent in airports waiting for their mechanics to get the planes in fit condition to fly amounts to $100 on an airline that I have no intention of ever flying again if there is any alternative. I've flown Spirit airlines multiples times and had better customer service than American provided. I advise you to steer clear and avoid American Airlines if at all possible.

This is fine if flying is straight forward and you have one bag. I was most unimpressed and sought assistance from ground staff who were helpful. I noticed older passengers who were struggling and thought about families with young children bags prams and car seats and wonder how one person is to manage. The plane was old and the seat uncomfortable and he was served the identical meal on the Auckland and Vancouver legs.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,6.0,Alys BoddÃ©,13th November 2015,"A very sour KLM ground stewardess checked us in at Schiphol in Amsterdam, The boarding was a giant mess. Business Class passengers were even asked to hold up their hands in order to find them in the chaos. Quite embarrassing! A mistake has been made with our frequent flyer miles. According to the boarding passes issued on the day of the flight, our miles would be booked on our Delta accounts. Mine ended up on KLM's Flying Blue and those of my husband ended up nowhere. At first KLM tried to ignore the issue, thereafter it saw it as our problem, finally it realized that we had sufficient proof to show that KLM itself had made the mistake. It took KLM over 2 months to get the frequent flyer miles on my Delta account. My husband is still waiting. I have spent tons of time dealing with this - in itself minor - issue. KLM's Customer Care is a disaster. All apologies, but no action. I hate KLM's 'no names given' policy. I'm Dutch and in the Dutch language we have a 'formal you' and an 'informal you'. I find it highly inappropriate that an anonymous KLM associate of Customer Care approached me with the 'informal you'.

Lufthansa,9.0,Lekon Niels,22nd October 2014,Flew with a A330 from Munich to NYC (JFK airport). It was a pleasant trip. Comfortable seats nice and very helpful flight attendants. Unlike e.g. British Airways which I have used for my last two trips to North America the catering on board was great. Additional water or juice e.g. was served regularly. The snack before landing consisted of WeiÃŸwurst Pralinen and a LaugenbrÃ¶tchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also the choice of films could have been better. Overall I was very satisfied.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,yes
United Airlines,8.0,R Brown,29th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to London. Thankfully, on this particular flight United's business class was the new Polaris configuration, which is about 100% better than its pre-historic 8-across business class configurations. So, right off the bat, things were moving in a positive direction. And there were few disappointments. Service was friendly, efficient and pleasant on the flight and on the ground on both sides of the Atlantic. United's arrival lounge in Heathrow is such a nice touch! My only complaint would be that the meal was not up to previous standards I have experienced on United's international business class (even in the pre-historic business class). The pre-packaged meals look and taste as though they are - pre-packaged. Moreover, while upgrading the seating environment, it seems UA has chosen to downgrade some of the amenities. For example, the amenities kit is pretty sparse compared to those previously offered.

American Airlines,1.0,Monique Scudder,17th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We purchased 2 first class tickets from San Jose to Aruba. Well San Jose to Phoenix to Miami to Aruba. All American Airlines and all purchased at once. On our way there the connecting flight from Phoenix to Miami (Phoenix layover) was very tight. Just under an hour. We made it ok. On our way back the layover was actually only about 30 minutes in that same airport! Our Miami to Phoenix flight was unfortunately 15 minutes late. And we discovered upon final decent (landing) that we were already 15 minutes past boarding time for next flight by the time that our plane was touching down in Phoenix! Our stewardess let us know this is a common problem for this airport and directed us to the AA magazine so we could familiarize ourselves with the airport and see which way we need to run. We waited for the airplane door to open, ran out first (since we were first class) and ran through the Phoenix airport from our arrival gate, two terminals away to departure gate. When we got there, the door was shut, and there were 5 other people there who didnâ€™t make it from other connecting flights besides ours. Everyone was complaining considering the plane was still right there. It didnâ€™t leave for another 20 minutes or so but it didnâ€™t matter. Upon getting to the customer service line, as the group of us did, there were others there complaining about the same issue. By our turn all the flights to the Bay Area for the night weâ€™re full. We were told at this point our checked luggage was here with us in Phoenix so we could get it and take their shuttle to double tree (with a voucher) though they didnâ€™t offer us a food voucher. Once at the carousels to pick up our luggage, we were told our luggage had actually made the flight. Then we were told we should have asked for a food voucher and we should go back. At this point we were 15 plus minutes down the airport and weâ€™re too frustrated to go back. When getting to the airport the next morning, we were told first class was full. The plane was full and we were not even going to be sitting near each other. So much for the extra money for first class! Horrible experience and customer service. Another thing is on one of our earlier flights, we watched the luggage being literally thrown mid air from a luggage cart to conveyer belt.",,Couple Leisure,First Class,Aruba to San Jose,April 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

They claimed it was due to a ""seat"" which needed to be repaired. This delay caused us a lot of trouble and extra cost as we missed our connection that night as well as first nights accommodation on an island resort - not cheap. The flight was uncomfortable at 5+ hours on an old 767 which was unclean. The guide in the seat pocket was full of chewing gum. Furthermore the volume on the safety video was so loud that passengers had to cover their ears. The video in general was also excessively long overly animated and ridiculous. Our second flight with ANZ we were already completely put off by this video and found it annoying. The crew served water from an unclean looking plastic pitcher.

Turkish Airlines,,Mark Evans,8th January 2014,London Heathrow to Odessa (Ukraine) return. The only positive was that the leg room is actually fairly decent. However: Online check in is a time consuming and laborious process. It is a completely pointless exercise as we had to queue for almost an hour to have the ground crew re-check us in for the flight and take our bags. Staff both on the ground and in the air were surly and miserable. My seat on the flight from LHR-IST was broken and did not lock in any position which was deeply uncomfortable. On the same flight my partner's TV was broken and did not work at all. It took the flight crew almost 1 hour 40 minutes to serve a drink. Transfer arrangements in Istanbul can only be described as a complete and utter shambles. No clear directions people everywhere being funnelled into a small security check area. On the way home we were told to go and join another random queue for a further passport check. Whilst at the gate in IST the flight to Odessa was delayed by an hour with no staff whatsoever in sight.

Aeromexico,2.0,O Jugarech,6th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew from London to Mexico City and back with AeroMexico and had an extremely disappointing experience. I used British Airways on this route before and should not have made the mistake of changing the airline. Flight London â€“ Mexico City was delayed 17 hours. We already had boarded the plane when we were told that a technical inspection was ongoing and we would be delayed by 1 hour, then2 hours, then 2.5 hours. After 2.5 hours we were finally told that the flight wouldnâ€™t depart. Admittedly handling of the delay was quite good â€“ it took me only about 1h from disembarking to getting into a hotel room and the following day flight departed and arrived without problems. What was not so good was handling of my request for delayed flight compensation (no answer received to date). On the return leg I made the mistake of going into the AeroMexio lounge in Terminal 2. The worst airline lounge I have ever seen and my travel experience is quite extensive. When I entered the shower I thought maybe it would be better to travel not feeling fresh than risking a disease. The lounge was small, crowded and smelly. This not to mention the incompetence level at the check in â€“ I appreciate that not all counters have to be opened, but the number of open counters should be sufficient not to make business class passangers wait for 25 minutes to check in the luggage. Flight departed with only 1h delay â€“ 16h less than on the way there - progress. Half way through the flight the entertainment system and light in my seat stopped working. Flight was fully booked so there was no way to change the seat.

Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-inâ€™s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class. Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice. I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though Iâ€™d prefer chairs to sofas â€“ and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, â€œAspireâ€, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN.

American Airlines,3.0,K Urbanic,22nd January 2016,"Good luck getting anything from American Airlines customer service. We had a connecting flight cancelled (radio failure) in Miami on New Years Eve, stranding us for two days and then we were finally rerouted through Boston (from Miami!) to get to San Diego when our first make up flight was delayed. Inconvenient, but not horrible until we tried to get reimbursed for hotel (Miami on NYE), basic clothing, and food needs (family of 5). You have to put your request in online and guess what? They won't respond for 6-8 weeks. Tried calling and they only have canned response to wait for the online response. You are stuck and there is nothing you can do about it. Pretty amazing that such a large company can get away with no accountability.

Delta Air Lines,6.0,C Lyttle,18th August 2014,A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat. Note I'm a 17 year old who can't book a hotel has nowhere to stay and needs to be on that flight the last one out that night. Thankfully the man gave me his seat and I made it home.

However, on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to re-enter immigration, reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450+ passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers. After waiting in line for two hours I was allocated a hotel room and told that Qatar Airways would contact me by telephone with details of onward journey. Finally arrived at hotel at 2.15am. By 10am the following morning I had heard nothing and was due to check out of hotel by 11, together with other passengers who had heard nothing. Numerous calls to the number given for the airline were unanswered and I eventually decided to check my booking online and found that I had been re-booked on a Qantas flight leaving that afternoon.

I wish I would have paid the extra money to fly another airline now. While leaving Louisiana we boarded the plane twice only to be told to go back and wait in the terminal. We were not informed as to what was going on and when asked if I would make my connecting flight in Dallas I was told that I would find out when I got there. When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour, which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long. The only thing that made the flight bearable is the fact there was movie service from the flight from Dallas to Las Vegas ($8 for a movie). I attempted to just check in online for my flight leaving tomorrow morning only to find out it told me my request could not be processed and I had to check in at the airport. I called the customer information number listed on the website only to be told it wasn't processing because I did not have a seat on my connecting flight from Dallas to Monroe.

However, on a recent flight with American Airlines back from New York we landed at Chicago O'Hare Airport on a bright, sunny Sunday afternoon only to learn that our 11.20 am flight back into Cedar Rapids had been cancelled. When we went to rebooking, we quickly learned there were no available seats to CID until the next day at 10.00 am. Now this is where the frustration kicks in. Rebooking told us to find a gate agent, they would be able to help. We found a gate agent and asked for help. She educated us that rebooking should have sent us to the main ticket desk. So, we went back out through security to the main ticket counter. There we were told we would not receive any compensation for rental car, or hotel. Clearly this was not a weather related issue.

You can choose your seats online if you booked with them, which is useful without paying an extra charge. The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight.

It was another hour before we made it to the desk and were told we were being rebooked on Delta through Minneapolis boarding now at a distant gate. Only one of our bags arrived in Minneapolis. We were told the others would meet us in Dulles. Had to stand in line at the lost baggage desk in Dulles for another hour 12 hours after we were supposed to have been in originally. The Delta staff were very helpful but we were told that the bags had never reached them so it was KLM's issue. When we contacted KLM they originally said it wasn't their problem contact Delta.

So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place?

However, she could not do anything else and Air Canada does not have a customer service phone line. My luggage arrived 2 days later at my in-laws house.

The food and drinks offered were high quality and plentiful except my fish entree was over cooked. The service was awkward. It was a full hour after takeoff before the in flight service was started. Food was prepared in the forward galley and plated in the rear galley which meant there was constant cabin staff traffic between the two galleys making the cabin environment frenetic. Beverages were only offered once at the beginning of the meal service.

United Airlines,6.0,Adam Consovoy,14th November 2015,"Recently traveled United Airlines to PVR from EWR round trip, non-stop going and connected thru IAH on the return. This time I opted to upgrade to Business Class on all three routes. Checking in was a breeze in EWR and security was surprisingly easy this time. Minor note, there is absolutely no reason to ever go to the Presidents club anymore in EWR with the updated food options in Terminal C. I would rather pay for a decent breakfast/lunch/dinner then eat the garbage they offer in the Club for ""free"". The seats were nice, however they allow too much recline for seats given the limited seat pitch. The gentleman in front of me reclined all the way back and I struggled to exit my seat to use the facilities without being very disruptive. Apart from the minor issue with the seats everything else about the flight was more than acceptable. The food was good not great. We were offered a decent breakfast, however the coffee is dreadful and the tea no better. The flight attendants were attentive and very cordial the entire time. Flying back thru to EWR from PVR via IAH was just fine except for the disaster that is IAH security. We nearly missed our connection due to extremely long queues to pass back through security after clearing customs. I have never seen only one line open in IAH when you have multiple flights trying to get through security at the same time.

Qatar Airways,4.0,H Mythenmetz,28th April 2015,At the end of March and again the beginning of April we travelled from TXL to DOH in an A330-200 business class. The total impression of the interior was not positive but rather rundown. The cabin staff on the other hand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ were very polite and helpful making the flight really agreeable. The electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. The most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. Another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. In the end they succeeded. The meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual - nothing worth mentioning. On the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircraft's are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired.

American Airlines,1.0,Paul Renshaw,6th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I bought my ticket via British Airways and 2 of the 5 sectors were with American Airlines. I had thought since I'd bought a full service ticket all the flights would be with full service airlines and not mixed with a budget airline. I am writing to BA to complain - even though the 3 sectors flying with BA were wonderful. My first flight with AA was Las Vegas to London via Chicago. I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions. Anyway my whole reason for writing this review is because of the food. Now I could feel the resentment from American Airlines. How dare they have to give free food out. What a shame so much of the transatlantic competitors do. I say free, of course it's in the ticket price but they call it complimentary. So by this point I'm starving and my kosher meal came. It blew my mind. One stale bun, crumbled in my hands. No butter or even spread, you'll have it dry. A side of sour shredded veg. I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile. For ""breakfast"" the offering was so ridiculous I kindly asked the attendant to take it back. I had hoped for a full English, but thought I might get a warmed 7 day croissant, but no, it was a stale bun with no butter. The mainstream offering was a bag of dried cranberries which I can't eat, a mixed berry slice of muffin (don't expect a full muffin!). It doesn't sound so horrific, just cheap, but I can't eat dried fruit. I did eat the yogurt which American couldn't mess up. I left the first plane ravenous and the second chewing my knuckles. There were only two drinks served over the 7 hours of course. Paid a full service price and fobbed me off with this.

United Airlines,1.0,Marcela Martinez,15th August 2014,"The second time United Airline had failed me. The first was on October 2013. This review is about my last flight in August 14. I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn't work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn't find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn't tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said ""Obviously it's right there can't you see it?"". I told her their screens are broken so no I can't see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

Once we boarded, the captain informed us we would have to get off because they were having some problems. First the re-boarding time was 9am, then it changed to 10.30am, then to 1pm. Upset, I went to the help desk to see if they could put me on a different flight or give me any information at all. The woman I spoke with was extremely rude and no help whatsoever. Halfway through our conversation she actually walked away from me to go ask someone when she could take her lunch. She gave me a food voucher and shooed me away.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Meschelle Jensen,7th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | We had an awful experience traveling from Ft. Lauderdale to Albuquerque on Southwest Airlines yesterday. First let me say that SWA has always been our airline of choice, but yesterday we experienced terrible customer service, and I do not know if we will ever fly with them again. At the Ft. Lauderdale airport our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We asked to re-rout the remainder of our flights, but we were assured that we had plenty of time to make all of our flights, so we had no need to re-rout. Our flight touched down in Nashville to allow more passengers to board the plane, the flight was then held on the ground to allow passengers that had been re-routed time to board the plane so that they could make connecting flights. We asked for help from the flight attendants, but were told it was out of their hands. When the flight landed in Denver we had fifteen minutes to catch our connecting flight, but the pilot announced that we could not get a gate, so we were held on the tarmac until after our flight left. At this point we went to the gate to ask for help and were told that we were held in Nashville so that many more people could make connecting flights, it was a business decision to hold us up so that more people could make their flights. We were told that we had been rebooked on the first flight out the next morning at 6:50 am (it was 10:00 at this time). I asked to speak to a supervisor because we now had to spend an unplanned night in Denver ""so that more people could make connecting flights, a business decision."" The same supervisor refused to give us a hotel voucher stating that he had already given away all vouchers for the day, but offered us a worthless coupon for a ""discount"" on a Best Western hotel room ($157-unsure when he could have a shuttle pick us up) or a no name hotel for $69 no shuttle. We ended up spending $234 at the Westin on the airport property since we had to be back at the airport for our flight in 6.5 hours by the time all of this transpired. The next day when we got home and claimed our luggage, it was wet, with the clothes inside soaked. In my opinion, if an airline makes ""a business decision"" to inconvenience one set of passengers to accommodate another set of passengers, they are at least obligated to pay for the hotel room of the stranded passengers.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft.

They fly a massive Boeing 777 on this Honolulu to Houston route and every single seat was sold. The boarding process was disorganized and unpleasant. Due to slight turbulence, the frowning flight crew weren't allowed to serve drinks until 2 hours into the flight. Once they got moving, they were constantly hitting into people and waking them up all night. There were no free meals, no AVOD, no smiles, and the flight crew were absolutely unapproachable and miserable.

American Airlines,1.0,Ian Prior,23rd September 2015,"Sadly I read these reviews of American Airlines, aircraft and route after I had booked. I can confirm what others say. Old planes, older cabin attendants and a Mickey Mouse type service by crew. No seat back entertainment centre, only central screen every 5/6 rows and programmes started before headsets even given out. Could hardly see the screens. Food absolutely terrible, especially on return leg to UK. Really cold on the flights. Our return flight was over the Atlantic when a warning light came on and the Captain returned to JFK. You could hear the alarm screeching in the background of his speech to the passengers. Escorted to stand by Fire Service after brakes checked. Second worst landing I have ever had in 45 years of flying. The landing in the replacement plane by the same pilot was only marginally better. The airline industry has moved on, especially the Middle East carriers, but American Airlines has not. I paid more for these 6/7 hour flights than I do for 14 hour flights to Asia.

An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,yes

Qatar Airways,9.0,Craig Cutts,5th April 2016,"I've used Qatar Airways in a mix of classes 10 times over the past year and I have to say in my opinion they are one of the best airlines at the moment. Check in LHR T4 quick and polite used the lounge (Skyteam) through my frequent flier status. Economy on the first flight seat 31A on the upper deck of the A380 comfortable seat with good AVOD departed on time. Service good with lunch and a snack served by a cheerful crew. Connection at DOH very good boarding on to a new looking Boeing 787 business class seat 4E which was very comfortable. Despite an early morning departure dinner served which was pretty good, I slept for 6 hours waking up to a cooked breakfast 2 hours out of CPT. Arrived a little late but bags off quick a great flight. Return CPT-DOH-LHR check in quick and polite, offered an exit seat which was nice, the Boeing 787 in economy is a little tight but I don't mind being small - the seat is also a little hard but otherwise a very nice aircraft food and service on this flight very good for economy. Connecting in DOH onto another A380 and again seat 31A upper deck. Early 03:30am departure so skipped food, although drinks offered through the flight - I slept 4 hours waking up for a cooked breakfast which was okay. Arriving a little late in to LHR bags arrived quickly. All in all a great product and currently my favorite airline.",A380 / Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to CPT via DOH,April 2016,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Adam Mueller,7th October 2013,My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no
American Airlines,1.0,David Hodgkiss,4th December 2014,Manchester to New York. Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear. That process would help to ensure the plane left on time rather than almost 20 minutes late. Their fleet is old-fashioned with screens down the centre aisle which cannot be viewed from certain seats. The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about. Even the crew's uniform was shabby.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,5.0,Alison Swain,24th February 2015,Just returned to Edinburgh today on QR027 from Doha on Dreamliner. As this is a day flight leaving at 7.30am which is why we booked it does anyone know why every single window blind was put in to blackout mode after breakfast was served (not done by the passengers) and the cabin lights dimmed? Stayed this way throughout flight couldn't even see what the FA was serving us unless you put reading light on. If I wanted the ambience of a night flight I would have booked one!

American Airlines didn't fulfill their contract to get me to Key West and then offered me one third of the price from Miami to Key West as a refund instead of the two hundred plus that they charge. Love their math. They wouldn't even pay for the rental car from Miami to Key West. I actually saved them money by driving instead of waiting for a flight the next day. What a way to start a family vacation. I had to drive from midnight until around three thirty. They didn't even have to pay for a motel in Miami since I didn't stay. Not a well run company.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,A LeClair,21st January 2015,"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,1.0,Andrei Muravev,20th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I bought and paid tickets 3 months before departure. I had pre-selected certain seats convenient to us. I am a self-moving disabled person. I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada â€“ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€ The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat.

I was in the middle of a 3 seat combination, my husband on one side and a larger (wide) man on the other who decided that sitting for the whole flight with his legs wide open and his body taking a 1/3 of my seat made the flight very awkward. This is too close for comfort. When the food was served it was hard to make out what the food was - there was a croissant with one of meals, it was so shriveled up. Scrambled eggs with some dreadful sauce on it, other food offerings I found to be poor. My husband is 6'3"" so when fellow passenger in front reclined his seat the space became impossible.

Emirates,2.0,Rama Naidoo,10th October 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Melbourne to Cape Town via Dubai. My wife and I were unable to select a seat on our flight from MEL-DXB-CPT until about 48 hour before the flight unless we pay $30 for each sector. We decided against and selected seats 48 hours before the flight. The real problem arose on our return journey from HDS-JNB-DXB-MEL. The HDS-JNB flight was with South African Airline and yet I was unable to checkin the Emirate flight from JNB-DXB-MEL. Emirates website directed us to check in via South African Airlines although the bookings confirmation numbers are different. I did online check in with South African Airline website but they insisted that I can only checkin the Emirate flights with Emirates website. Anyway we arrived in Johannesburg JNB and went to the Emirates check in desk. I explain to the check in person that we require an aisle and the next seat so that we do not have to disturb the next passenger for toilet break. After all explanation she gave us a window and middle seat. She disregarded our request. To top it up she directed our bags to MEL but will not and could give us the boarding pass from DXB to MEL. She stated that there is a regulation and restriction to do so. Surprisingly two other Australians who were checking in in the next counter were giving boarding passes with seat allocation all the way to Melbourne. When we landed in Dubai I went to Emirates service and requested boarding passes and the appropriate seats. To our surprise we were given two seats (under the same booking number). Mine was in row 66 and my wife in row 88. We were totally separated. We were told that the flight was over booked. No amount request and pleading was considered. We were told to go the the boarding gate and ask for different seats but there is no guarantee that we will be together. The Emirates staff were rude and acted like robots. Finally at the boarding gate we were given a window and middle seats. We had to constantly disturb the person sitting in aisle seat for toilet visits.

Next, while I had requested a specific dietary meal a few days before boarding, the airline had no record of. Instead of trying to be accommodating and helpful, the steward's attitude was ""we don't have it."" There was no one offering drinks throughout the flight. While deplaning with my children (as we were last), I thanked the steward. His hostile reply was, ""well, the cleaning crew is waiting for you."" I was shocked, and in the scurry, I forgot my cell phone on the plane. There was no one at the gate to welcome us, and report the lost phone. I had to go to a central service desk, wait a half hour for service to file a report, which didn't get me anywhere.

Emirates,10.0,Rob Bowden,6th July 2015,"This was my first flight on the new Emirates A380. We flew Heathrow to Dubai in economy class (then on 777 to Delhi). I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus. The business cabin is spacious with seat arrangement 2-3-2, we were in 2 of the middle 3. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat style so I slept this leg but my son stayed awake and enjoyed the Hennessey XO.","A380, 777",Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Delhi via Dubai,January 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Once on a trip to Halifax, once on a trip to Las Vegas and this is the third time they have done it on my trip to Italy. Halifax and Las Vegas were both five day trips, I spent the first three days of these trips without baggage. I understood that because I made connections that it is possible there was not enough time to properly get the bag onto the next flight. However, if this is something that often happens maybe it is best they stop charging for connections they do not have the capability of properly executing. This most recent flight to Milan, I checked in 4 hours early for a direct flight. There is absolutely no reason my baggage should have been left in Toronto. This is my third day in Italy without my baggage, how has it still not made it on another flight? I am writing a review on here because the customer service website for Air Canada is insufficient, there is no direct email for customer service, instead they lead you to numerous automated responses. Working in customer service myself, I understand that mistakes happen. However, considering I have given this company thousands of dollars over the last few years I am fed up. I see no reason why in 2018 they can charge $1,200 for a round trip, direct flight to Milan and be so behind that baggage cannot arrive with that flight. I am ready to ditch Air Canada completely and give another company my money.

As usual with Alitalia there was no order in calling rows to board the plane and a huge crowd of passengers were standing there waiting for the rows to be called. Very confusing without structure. My seat was completely abused and it was the worst seat Iâ€™ve had on over 200 flights in my life. Crew looked great but poor service. Arrogant and unlike other airlines they were sitting talking among themselves in the back of the plane. Last time for me flying Alitalia!

American Airlines,1.0,B Gentry,13th July 2014,I had not flown AA for a few years and now I know why. AA employees sat in first class on a very early flight from TPA-MIA and spoke loudly to one another while the other first class passengers tried to sleep. Had a 7.40pm flight from MIA-TPA but paid a $75 plane change fee to take the 5.50pm flight. No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.,,,First Class,,,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,3.0,A Broomes,10th August 2015,"The cabin on the new Airbus is lovely. Comfortable bar and lounge area, excellent seats with your own personal mini-bar. On these facilities I have no complaints. My disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof, and I am afraid the ultimate criticism - it was no different to being in Economy. On each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men, despite waiting patiently I always had to ask. On an 8 hour evening flight I was told, ""we don't hand these out on evening flights."" The menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. But in reality there is no choice, just like in Economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. Tray table is pulled out on the hour, breakfast arrives 20 mins later, coffee follows after 10 mins, and the refill never came. Within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. I could see post take off drinks being served, but I was never offered one. It becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. I have often mocked the likes of Virgin for their automated approach to customer service - but at least you all receive the same service, it is not the luck of the draw. They are inefficient, unorganised, rude, and left me in no doubt that I will never travel Emirates Business Class again.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Johanesburg via Dubai,August 2015,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no

I had traveled to Italy 2 other times within the last month (flights SQ366 and BA2540) and they never asked for such information so I know for certain this is not a standard practice for a check-in desk. All tourist that travel to countries where they don't need visa, have some restrictions for the length of stay, but they only asked me for further probes, and this was done in a very denigrating and discriminatory way. At the end they gave me my boarding pass, only because someone I was traveling with had printed some reservations, but otherwise I would have been denied the right to board. I read the terms of my Alitalia ticket purchase and it is only written I should show my passport or visa if necessary, nowhere is written I should have printed my traveling plans.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,M Sean,18th February 2015,Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squashed (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for an overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory! That said the service was good and the flight attendants were meticulous and more than happy to walk around offering snacks and drinks every hour even when passengers are asleep. Nonetheless never on this airline again for long haul flights maybe a short 2-3 hour one.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,no

I had really low expectations given that this airline is not a big name like others out there but I'm happy to say I had an excellent experience. Both my flights were on time they offered free snacks (no peanuts here legit snacks!) and soda/tea/coffee. The service and the whole experience was great.

Alitalia,3.0,Lauren Skelton,24th October 2016,"London to Tokyo via Rome. Possibly the most uncomfortable long haul flight I have been on. The seats seem purposefully uncomfortable as they have a large head rest which pushes your head forward in the upright seat position. Also in every window seat there is a large box at your feet which cuts out 80% of your legroom. The seats themselves were hard and lumpy, although you did get a pillow and blanket which eased the pain slightly. The in-flight entertainment system looks like it hasn't been updated in around 20years but there were a few recent films at least. The cabin crew were mainly older, grumpy Italian men who seemed to hate their job. The food was ok by airline standards but I don't feel you really got enough to last the 12hr flight duration.

Before arriving at O'Hare, many passengers had received multiple texts/emails stating the flight was to be delayed with significant fluctuations in the delay time with each message. After everyone had waited at the gate for 2+ hours, we were told that the flight was to be cancelled because there was simply ""no crew."" The manager thought it was a proper compensation to just give $10 meal vouchers to the passengers and then told us to all get in a line for customer service. Almost all the passengers, including myself, waited in line for over an hour, being told that perhaps we could get a hotel room courtesy of United until the next flight out that wasn't already overbooked, which made many for around 9:20 PM almost 24 hours later than the original flight. As we were standing in line, an employee gave us papers telling us to call a customer service number that might be able to help us out, which had the majority of us on hold for 15+ minutes. When I was finally able to speak to a representative, the conversation was unhelpful as there was seemingly nothing that could be done. As the end of the line reached the desk, we were told that the hotels that United could offer rooms in were booked up and that they couldn't offer us that either.

Starting from check in I checked in online the night before my trip. At the airport the ground staff who checked me in were very friendly. Because I had a short transfer flight to catch 1.5 hours after handing in Doha they put a label of rapid transfer on my checked in luggage. The first flight from Heathrow to Doha only 30% of the economy class were seated and basically every passenger had a row to lie down. The dining service was great cabin crews were extremely nice even though you ask them to get you another drink several times they didn't have any printed forms of menu they present you a menu on your personal IFE screen.

I swore I would never fly American again but I found a great deal recently and I thought I would give them another chance. I purchased travel insurance just in case and was ready to go. Unfortunately I just lost my job and when I called to cancel the flight I was told that there was a $200 service fee. She then explained that since my flight was less than that, I would just lose that money and not have to pay anything extra. When I told her that I would never be flying American Airlines again she got very rude and short with me. Apparently customer service isn't a priority for American Airlines. I will never use them to travel again and I don't recommend it for anyone else.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Sacramento,December 2014,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,1.0,B Vorgen,26th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Dubai. I already have a complaint before I get into the plane. I had made a typo in his first name when booking an extra ticket for my son. There was Sterfan instead of Stefan (so letter r too much). I called Emirates to ask if this was a problem. This had to be changed, because at the airport this would cause problems and could not be changed. Cost was 47 EUR. Really absurd. This feels worse than a traffic fine because you drove 4 km too hard. I understand that this is something in the Terms & amp",,,,,,,,,,,,

American Airlines,1.0,J Christofferson,17th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Virginia Beach to Chicago via Charlotte. About 50-60% of the time there is an issue. Typically, a delay. My latest experience not only included a delay, a cancellation, and then a flight change to one full day later, it also included a 3 hour cluster-you-know-what of uncertainty as to where our baggage was. The ticket tracing system was completely usesless and when I attempted to speak to one of their robotic customer service reps, I was told that there was nothing that could be done and that my bags would be available the next day in Chicago. (We were trapped in Charlotte for the night). The issue is that at the time of flight change to make up for the cancellation, we were guaranteed by an AA rep that our baggage would be released upon arrival in Charollette. When trying to explain this to the baggage service rep, I was told I was wrong, and that nobody could go get the bag for over 5 hours. There are many more details surrounding the disrespectful way that the baggage claim rep handled the situation but my qualm is with the rip-off that is AA as an organization"".",,Business,Economy Class,Virginia Beach to Chicago via Charlotte,July 2017,3.0,5.0,,,2.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,4.0,S Derano,17th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dallas to Bangkok via Doha. Avoid flying this airline if you have a heavy carry on - the carry-on weight limit is 7kg, my carry on weight totaled 9kg. I happened to have one check-in bag which was already 5lbs over limit. I could not place things inside the check-in bag from my backpack. SoI had to pay $700 extra to fly the same flight for the next day. This taught me the lesson of having a spare bag to carry that you can check in for the situation of having an overweight carry-on. I also learned the lesson of booking directly with Qatar Airways instead of an online website. You will pay hundreds of dollars extra to change a ticket with an online website. When I flew back from Bangkok , the ticketing agent there was also extremely anal retentive about my carry-on weight. I wish Qatar let people pay extra money (overweight baggage fee) in order to board. I would rather pay an extra $150 for a heavy carry-on than a $700 change ticket change charge.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Bangkok via Doha,August 2018,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,no

Air New Zealand,3.0,S Naskan,28th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Just flown Auckland to Sydney return, with Air New Zealand outbound and return with their partner Virgin Australia. The difference in the level of comfort between the two airlines was remarkable. The outward journey with Air New Zealand was in a Boeing 777-200 with a 3x4x3 seat configuration. My husband and I were in the middle section of the row, he on the aisle. As we boarded, passengers with backpacks were advised to carry the packs in front of them. Once we were onboard it was evident why this advice was offered. The aisles are extremely narrow with the 3x4x3 configuration and my husband needed to make sure his elbow was always tucked in for fear of being hit by the meal/drinks carts or the crew walking up and down. The lady next to me spilled into my space, she was very plump and there was just not sufficient room to accommodate her size, so I spent the flight hunched trying to make myself as small as possible and I am petite to begin with. I cannot imagine what it would be like to be on a long haul flight on this aircraft, especially as none of the seats in our row reclined. Coming back with Virgin Australia was a completely different experience. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, a much smaller aircraft with just one central aisle, and 3x3 configuration. The seats were wider, there was more legroom and I did not feel jammed in at all. Virgin Australia is a no frills carrier. There are no screens for entertainment or safety videos or flight map, (although they are happy for you to download a free Virgin entertainment app for your laptop or phone) but I would gladly forgo the bells and whistles of Air New Zealand for the comfort of Virgin Air.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AKL to SYD,November 2016,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Y Bramhar,15th May 2016,"Singapore to Brussels via Istanbul, returning from Berlin. To Brussels, everything ran like clockwork and a satisfactory experience. Food and entertainment were on par with other carriers. But when things go wrong, TK falls apart. A technical fault delayed my flight back from Berlin. Initially, the delay was announced to be 90 minutes, meaning many passengers would miss connections in IST, including myself. The fate of transit passengers was left to the transfer desk in IST, as TXL ground staff refused to do anything. This was extremely nerve-racking because my connecting flight to SIN operated only daily, so I would have had to stay overnight in IST if I missed it. When I explained the situation and asked to be re-booked from TXL, ground staff rejected my request, and said they could do nothing nor provide any information on my connecting flight. Several transit passengers were frustrated over the lack of answers resulting in arguments with ground staff. There were further delays during boarding, and no explanations or revised departure time was provided. Eventually, the flight left 2.5 hours late. In IST, transfer desk said SIN flight was over 4 hours late. Why couldnâ€™t the ground staff in TXL tell me this? We were also told there were food vouchers at the ironically labeled â€œcare pointâ€, staffed by rude employees who spoke poor English. There were no food vouchers",,,,,,,,,,,,

I will overfly my destination and give myself a layover in Doha because they are were so good. I arrived with my 11 year old son very early for check in Madrid. So much so they were still checking in the early flight to Doha. QR 150 not 152. But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s.

Night flight nothing special other than the fasten seat belts sign was illuminated for the duration of the meal service and collection of trays, with no Turbulence.

The drinks selection however was decent. The IFE had a reasonable selection of new releases but the music selection remains obscure and totally irrelevant. I would like to know who actually appriciates AC's music selection. The service director did an admirable job interacting with passengers which gave the journey a personal touch. The seat was the usual pod style and less than comfortable in the flat position. The toilets looked grimy and in need of a thorough scrub. Flight left and arrived on time and although it was tagged as ""priority"" my bag came out very late during delivery.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Luis Starr,26th April 2015,Done 4 flight segments in 3 weeks DMM-IST IST-FCO BCN-IST and IST-DMM. Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737. IFE was average not much new movies and quite unresponsive the touchscreens you'll still have to use the remote. Information from the cockpit came only twice before take off and before landing. Food - their lunch and dinner are good above average servings are large plus Turkish delight is distributed prior to take off. Drinks were served frequently which was good amenity kits were given which was a plus!

Qatar Airways,10.0,C Down,18th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Birmingham to Manila via Doha. Check in at Birmingham was very quick and easy and was given fast track security, although in Birmingham this is pretty badly organised! The lounge is a 3rd party lounge called No.1, which is quite nice and modern inside and with reasonable amount of seating tables etc. Because it is a lounge which you can pay to use they limit how much hot food you can have which is a shame as the portions are not large, although it was actually delicious. Boarding was easy and quick and my amenity kit was already in my seat and I was immediately offered a welcome drink. All crew on board were fantastic throughout the flight. Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didnâ€™t sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isnâ€™t too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool. There is fairly good storage space although limited table space. Regarding IFE, whilst the 787 has a newer system, I actually found the 777 system more responsive and easier to use and the quality was still really good! Overall an outstanding flight and very good value for money.

Emirates,4.0,Safyana Younas,11th August 2018,"Not Verified | Totally disappointed with Emirates on the flights from Manchester to Dubai, and from Dubai to Manchester on the way back. Flights to and from Singapore the cabin crew were very good but airplane was old and some of the touch screens were not working and also the seats were not very good. The experience at Manchester airport was horrendous- that wasnâ€™t the airlines fault. Once we got onto plane the plane though the experience didnâ€™t improve the stewards and stewardesses looked bored and could not be bothered with passengers. When they did come round it felt as though they were just completing jobs without a care as to how they do it! Also noticed that the kids meals were not presented as they used to be 2 years ago when I last traveled with them. Dubai to Manchester on the 31st of July- firstly flight we had booked was supposed to be from Singapore to Colombo and then to Dubai, they had overbooked and as a result offered us a direct flight from Singapore to Dubai which we didnâ€™t have an issue with. Flight from Dubai was a different story the cabin staff looked depressed and really difficult to deal with. You would ask nicely but their responses were really short and every time it was a no! Having had 3 children with us they were given breakfast part of which was cereal, all 3 were given different cereals which caused problems as they all wanted the same one, when the air stewardess was asked if she could check if there was this particular cereal available her answer was no straight away without even checking. Overall we just feel as a family in future we would rather travel long haul with other airlines as Emirates service was terrible and reading reviews we donâ€™t appear to be the only ones. Emirates have started offering a saver fare which if you book be aware you will not be able to pre select your seats. Inflight entertainment was some of the worst I had seen - some of the movies were really old! I think Emirates appear to have forgotten who they are competing against here, it appears they want to compete with budget airlines hence they are using their pricing tactics.

Upon requested to change the meal to the one I selected at the time of booking (veggie), the answer provided was that I did not select the meal. Fact is that I did select the meal as soon as I booked my ticket. In fact, later I called up the airline because I was unable to select Infant meal for all the flights and confirmed that my meal is selected. I spoke to the air-host and he replied with a question if I selected the meal. He said he'll check the file and get back. He did not. When questioned, he said he does not have any vegetarian meal. I asked for a fruit. That was my meal for lunch. For breakfast, the air-host asked ""What would you like to have (was given 2 choices)"". I said the one I selected. He replied that he does not have. I thought they don't have the kind of breakfast I was seeking. I walked up to another hostess without the knowledge of this person and she gave me the veggie breakfast. I was terribly upset, tired with baby on my lap the whole time and hungry. I confronted with him on the flight questioning his conscience of how indifferent he could be. I asked who I should contact for this.

They apologised to us in person on the flight and advised us that we would be put up in a hotel overnight and rebooked onto a flight the next morning (there were no flights to Schiphol that night after our missed connection). The staff on the flight gave us instructions on how to use the appropriate self service terminals within Schiphol to obtain our vouchers for accommodation, transport and food overnight. Through the terminal at Schiphol, we were easily able to check in for our flight the next morning (already rebooked for us), select our seats, and print vouchers for a hotel stay, airport food and a shuttle bus to and from the hotel. The vouchers for food worked at the terminal and transport to the Ibis hotel was efficient and straightforward. On arrival at the hotel, there was a special check in desk for delayed KLM customers and we were served promptly and professionally, with a timetable provided for the shuttle bus the next day.

Then a choice of lounge in T3 for Oneworld (BA, AA, Cathay and the new Qantas lounge). I was entitled to use the AA Admirals Club, but opted instead to use the Cathay Pacific lounge which was great. Once on board I got settled in quickly and was really impressed with the extra legroom I got in Main Cabin Extra and some of the lockers are designated as reserved for these customers. The inflight food and beverage offering is the same as everyone else in Main Cabin. But I can't really grumble. I got a drink and a sweet biscuit within an hour of departure. For Lunch, which followed shortly afterwards, portions were sufficient and the main course very tasty. The FA's were generous with the wine and we're happy to give refills on request. About an hour out from landing a hot small pizza calzone was served with a choice of drinks.

Flight to Johannesburg was not so staff seemed occupied and unavailable. You had to keep asking for things like kids toys drinks etc which I do not really like doing.

Lounges: Very poor. GYD DOH and BKK are not pleasant. Emirates leave you so far behind in pre-flight care. Boarding: At both GYD and DOH when flying to GYD it is a scrum. No pre-boarding for BC and very little interest in premium passengers until we're onboard. I pay a lot of money for my flights and I expect a little bit more than QR provide here. Inflight: Staff are great service excellent movies and videos don't change often enough and food is a big problem. Many customers have been traveling for a long time before the airport and when you put us in a lounge where the snacks/food is atrocious we are looking to be fed onboard. To wait six hours for a breakfast is ridiculous given that you only provide a snack after boarding. All in all not bad but some of your rivals really are so much better in many aspects. At least you provide genuine BC seats in the short haul sectors unlike some other carriers.

I flew on an A380 and a Boeing 777-300ER, the leg room is better than other airlines in economy. The staff could not have done enough, on my flight from DOH to DPS I was sat in the middle with 4 other men, broad shoulders, so they upgraded me to business! I will be flying this airline again long haul as I think they are one of the best carriers out there in terms of leg room and routes. My only complaint would be that the meals are rather small, so you might be hungry during the flight.

LHR-ATH flight was smooth cabin lighting could have been dimmed with one meal/trolley service for the flight food was served quickly however and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. ATH-JMK was the quickest flight I've ever done and by the time they handed out the drinks they were grabbing them back for landing. Overall a pleasant flying experience helped by the open selection on booking seats (I got exit rows) and the ability to check in 48 hrs before. My one criticism is when doing cabin announcements they speak English so quickly that you do not always hear/understand what is being said.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling. They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half.

I had a broken seat on the return that did not recline. It didn't matter that our luggage was lost again on the return because we were home. What did matter was that after contacting American Airlines about our problems, they did not even respond until the 3rd letter and then told us that it is not their policy to give any compensation for lost luggage unless we had purchased approved items and had saved all receipts.

Air Canada,4.0,Richard Moller,24th September 2014,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked â€œPriorityâ€ were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,no
Jetblue Airways,1.0,Jon Anthony,2nd July 2015,"Comically mismanaged operation. Problems began when the departure gate was mobbed- seems an earlier flight had 'technical problems', so it departed an hour late at my original gate. We were then redirected to an alternate gate, and waited. And waited. And waited. They now had us waiting on the plane with 'technical problems' and they basically had the other flight go out with our intended jet, and we were stuck. It took text message from my daughter thousands of miles away to inform me the flight was finally cancelled. Not one word from JetBlue staff at the boarding gate. Finally, 2 hours after scheduled departure, they announced baggage was at the carousel, and ""being monitored by JetBlue associates"" I went down to claim my bag - no JetBlue staff in sight. I quickly went to ticketing, got an apology and refund from the embarrassed support staff, and proceeded to Southwest, where I ended up having to pay +$500 more for their next direct flight with a confirmed seat. I understand this is a mechanical industry and there will be problems, but it's how an airline manages the problem that is a mark of their business integrity and customer focus.

I could follow this pattern until I was called back. I asked to speak to customer service. They told me I could email customer service and they would reply back in a couple weeks.

I really enjoyed these flights and was impressed with the good service. The seats, though hardly any leg room, surprisingly felt comfortable too. Both flights were on time.

Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos.

The Alitalia business class on their A330 is quite similar to Etihad's. The plane was clean IFE system decent. The biggest disappointment however was the crew and their (non) service. The welcome drink which other airlines offer business class passengers when they are installed at their seat was offered when the plane was pushed off the gate more than 1 hour after boarding (we had to wait for transit passengers from late incoming flights). Breakfast was offered 2 hours after departure without having seen any flight attendant whatsoever between take off and breakfast being served. Once the breakfast trays were collected the crew disappeared again and we just saw now and then stewardesses passing through the cabin as if they thought they were movie stars totally ignoring passengers. Even when the captain announced the descend till the landing itself the crew preferred not to appear did not bother to check if seat belts were fastened tray tables stowed away and seats were in upright position. Most window screens were even still closed when we landed which I believe is against regulations. I don't think I ever experienced a crew which had so few interest in its passengers. It was clear that we were regarded as an annoyance and just disturbed their chit chat sessions.

Alitalia,9.0,Richard Callis,8th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Sao Paulo to Rome. Premium Economy with Alitalia is a fabulous product. Excellent legroom, comfortable seat. Food was served on plates not in an economy style carton. Nice touches provided like a liquor and espresso with meal, hot towel before meal. Cabin is separated and feels spacious. As it is separate there is also plenty of overhead luggage space. Food was good. Price was also very reasonable maybe 15% higher than what i would expect to pay for an economy ticket on this route. Very pleased, this is definitely a good way to fly long distance.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Sao Paulo to Rome,March 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Air New Zealand,3.0,C Thompson,15th August 2013,Flew from Auckland to Shanghai (and a connection from Wellington to Auckland). I had originally booked a return flight from London Heathrow to Auckland via Hong Kong but Air NZ axed their LHR-HKG route before I returned. They were not able to book me onto a flight to Hong Kong and so booked me to Shanghai instead and then onwards from Shanghai to London with Virgin Atlantic - meaning I had to scrap my planned holiday trip to Hong Kong and fly straight home - for which I also had to pay extra for even though they caused the route change. Having found previous long haul and Trans Tasman flights with Air New Zealand to be great I was extremely disappointed by this flight. The plane itself seemed very old and was not to clean boarding was very rushed felt like cattle being herded on board (the same leaving the plane too.) The flight was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and this was poorly dealt with by staff. Seating was extremely uncomfortable and I was not able to sleep at all for the 13hr duration and in flight entertainment was mediocre. Food was quite good however there was a complete lack of customer service from the crew except 1 or 2 members. They did not seemed bothered at all with passengers and were not too friendly. Very poor service and will not be travelling with Air New Zealand again on long haul from Europe to NZ.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,no

Emirates,3.0,F Marten,14th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Cape Town to London via Dubai. Budget long haul airline. Starving hungry on a 9.5 hour flight. No movie snacks served. Nothing except a standard lunch after take off and then a disgusting vegetable baked good just before landing. 7 hours daytime flying with no food. What a joke. On the next leg from Dubai dinner was a turkey ham roll and that was it for 7 hours until an inedible breakfast was offered. Cheese and cracker with breakfast? Demonstrative of the lack of care and attention by emirates. Dirty planes. Smelly toilets. I will never fly Emirates again. How reviewers are consistently rating Emirates above BA is beyond me and as we know BA is hardly a high benchmark. A massive TV screen and a large selection of films does not make up for a budget service.

Emirates,4.0,N Massar,6th March 2016,"Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons. However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,R Caws,23rd June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Extremely unhappy with Delta. I had a so-so experience during a flight to Little Rock on a Delta partner a few years ago. This time around we flew into DCA. Upon departing D.C., we were delayed by inclement weather to a connection in Atlanta. Even though we selected an alternative flight upon self check-in, we received passes for the cancelled flight. Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning. On other notes, Delta doesn't offer a free checked bag like many airlines. To check one bag is $25. The food on the flight to LAX was overpriced generic junk, think $12 for a wrap you could have bought for $5 at 7-11.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DCA to LAX,June 2016,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

During the dessert, they served ice cream, but for myself and my wife there was no spoon. We ended up with the tea stirrer.

Aegean Airlines,4.0,H Matthews,6th July 2014,Flew London Heathrow - Athens and back. Aegean have introduced these hopeless self check in machines. Having already checked in online and printed our boarding passes we ignored the machines at Heathrow and went straight to the desk where the assistant refused to serve us until we had used a machine. But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,no

The disappointment started with entry to the lounge on both occasions where no substantial food was offered. Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent Â£6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service). Liquid refreshments are limited with my husband being charged for a third drink when I had not even had one! It would appear that United Airlines Cabin Crew Bar Staff and Club reception staff attend regular classes in being curt disinterested or just plain rude! Thankfully waiting staff etc do not and are very pleasant. Regarding the plane itself on both occasions these were very obviously old and incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting in row 2 on both flights subjected we were subjected to cabin crew slamming doors continuously chatting very loudly or witness several members chomping on food whilst preparing the passengers meagre offerings. Please United Airlines take note of all these negative reviews you are offering a low budget service at a Premium price.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,M Tonelli,10th July 2016,"Delta in my opinion, is the best american airline to fly transatlantic flights. Had a very cheap ticket for my vacation to Italy. On the first leg, I was seated in the very last row, and there was no window where I was sitting. The plane was very full, so I was not moved. The crew were nice and gave me extra snacks and drinks and apologized for the bad seat. The seats were rather uncomfortable, but they were tolerable for the flight time. Best part about the first leg was the IFE. Delta has free streaming from your device, so I was occupied during my entire flight. At JFK, we had a very short connection, of only 51 minutes, but the previous flight arrived 20 minutes early and the international flight left 20 minutes late, so we had plenty of time. Delta terminal at JFK, terminal 4, is nothing special, and lacks food options. The last leg, going to Pisa, was very good. The 757-200 is very good to fly transatlantic routes, and it had a new interior with mood lighting, IFE, and extremely comfortable seats. The touchscreen were very fast and responsive, with plenty of movies and other options. Dinner and drinks came out right away, and the options, the classic chicken or pasta, of which I chose chicken, was very good. Plenty of food and drinks to keep me satisfied throughout the 7 hour flight. I slept for 4 hours, which is a lot for me, I usually don't sleep on planes, but the seats were extremely comfortable. All the seats had USB and AC power, so I kept all my devices charged and ready for taking pictures. Flight arrived 20 minutes early, and all my baggage arrived, so I was very satisfied with this flight, much better experience than what can be found on American or United. Will definitely fly Delta and this route again.","CRJ900, Boeing 757-200",Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to PSA via JFK,June 2016,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,6.0,A Bor,6th July 2014,RIX-SVO-PVG and back. From RIX to SVO it was a partner flight with Air Baltic. Then came the horror of SVO-PVG. I had no option to choose seats. I was asked in RIX while checking in for seat preference and I said aisle. I did get one for RIX-SVO and for SVO-PVG I got a 28th row which on their A330 is in front of the toilets and the seat does not recline. The seats were rather worn and entertainment system was slow though the selection of media was excellent. The food was plain insulting with 2cm of salmon sliced over some canned carrots and peas presented as a salad. The bun was hard and the choice of main course was chicken or fish for dinner and chicken or goulash for the supper. The dessert was surprisingly good though I had to wait 40 minutes for the tea to have it with while they were finishing servicing everyone. And now for the best part the service. Apparently they are split in the teams of 2 with some kind of good cop / bad cop principle as in both aisles we've seen one was making attempts to smile and the other one was plain offensive. The bathrooms were hardly cleaned the pilots announcements were hardly audible. So imagine my surprise when on the return flight from Shanghai to Moscow I was greeted by a very professional and helpful staff (still not smiling) got into a very comfortable seat of a brand new shiny 777 with plenty of room even with 3-4-3 scheme great new entertainment system with touchscreen much fresher air and the food was really delicious including a very fresh bun. The short flight SVO-RIX was also very pleasant with a nice little airbus with sufficient space a delicious chicken sandwich and soft drinks and the sweetest flight attendant. To sum it all I'd say its a real hit and miss thing with Aeroflot. Stay away from the airbus on the long flights make sure its a 777 they're great. If you're unlucky enough to get airbus steer clear of row 28. The food probably depends on where they get it. The entertainment is excellent on long flights tons of good movies TV shows and music. Do not expect a good polite service on every flight. Other than that flights were on time with great connections and very reasonably priced.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,yes
Lufthansa,3.0,Sriram Kailasam,5th December 2015,"I booked Lufthansa from Bangkok to Nice via Frankfurt return. On my way back, there was a technical glitch with the engine and my flight got delayed by 9 hours. As a result, I missed my connecting flight (With Thai Airways) and was forced to stopover in Bangkok for 10 hours. However, the worst part was the customer service at Frankfurt First Class counter which is where I was directed to, to get further help. It proved to be anything but, helpful. I asked the person at the counter, that due to this delay, now I would not only miss my connections but, also have to stay overnight in Bangkok for 10 hours - how would Lufthansa assist. I was informed that my Contract with Lufthansa ended in Bangkok as my connection was booked separately with Thai Airways and not through Lufthansa. I had to go to customer service online or look for Thai Airways staff in Bangkok. When I tried to explain to him that it is basic courtesy that he or someone in Frankfurt office communicates this to their Bangkok office in advance, so I donâ€™t have to go looking for their representative at midnight after a long flight, I was informed this is not possible as they had given me an airport hotel voucher in Frankfurt for the delay and had met their obligation and their contract ended the moment I landed in Bangkok. I re-iterated that all I wanted was that they communicate to their team at the other end, so whatever solution they have can be pre-planned, as it was Lufthansa fault. However, it proved too difficult for the counter person to comprehend, and I had to ask for his supervisor, who seemed to understand and agreed to inform their Bangkok team. I could not comprehend the service standards and I could not escape the feeling that they were doing me a favor. I understand delays happen, technical glitches happen but, the manner in which you deal with your customers under such circumstances shows the quality of any airline.

You then have to walk up to a clerk who then weighs your bag, checks your ticket and ID all over again. Why do we have to do the same exact thing twice? Total waste of time. Once we were on the plane, we were excited to see that there were TVs with movies, tv shows, etc available. However, the pilot and attendants interrupt the screens whenever they speak over the microphone, and they play through your headphones at inexcusable volume. Each time they came over the loudspeaker, you could look around and everyone was ripping their earphones out of their ears. This was at least twice an hour on a 3 hour flight. On the 3 hour flight, you can have 1 drink but no snacks are provided. I know that flying isn't luxurious in economy class, but they make everything more annoying and complicated than needed.

My connecting flight from Denver got cancelled and I ran to the customer service desk to find a huge line had already formed and there were only 2 people working behind the desk. I waited for over 3 hours to speak to someone - when I finally got to the desk the woman was completely unhelpful and rude. She offered some inconvenient flights that wouldn't have gotten me home until late the next day. While in line I used my phone to find more convenient flights that I showed the woman and she says ""oh well I guess that would work too"". So I waited 3 hours to get absolutely no help. Since I was going to have to spend the night in the freezing airport, I asked if I could have a pillow and blanket for the evening (and I know they have them because they give bagged pillows and blankets to people in first class) - she told me that they don't provide amenities to people with cancelled flights. I also asked if I could have a food voucher since I was going to be at the airport for an extra 14+ hours that I hadn't planned on and she said they don't provide food vouchers to people unless their flight had been delayed for four hours. No my flight was not delayed for four hours it was cancelled and I was at the airport an extra 14 hours! So I ended up paying an extra $35 dollars on horrible, overpriced airport food because of my cancellation. I spent the night shivering, trying to sleep at the airport until my morning flight.

Air New Zealand,7.0,J Pearson,26th August 2014,I am a Qantas Platinum but decided to try something different. Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing!

The crew walked off saying they were off duty. The 800 number representatives refer you back to the airport staff which now we can't speak with as we were no longer in the security area. The retrieving of bags was a total mess, it took at least 2 hours for our bags to get pulled off due to so many cancellations. Now I have to wait 2 days to get a flight out not even comparable to the original booking. Isn't a whole plane full of cancelled people enough to add the additional flight that's already been paid for?

We got to the gate abut 30 minutes later and we basically sprinted towards our connection. The connection was done on an A321, still old interior, new livery. This flight was a little more comfortable but no beverages because of turbulence. The return flight was all on time and every thing about the same. I really hope American Airlines will improve its domestic service with free snacks on flights more the 3 hours long. Also same rule should apply to alcoholic beverages. They should improve seats, especially in economy, with IFE and make it free on longer domestic flights. My experience was not one I would love to do again, unless American improves.

Air Canada,9.0,J Lynch,6th May 2014,We took two fights one from Calgary to Frankfurt and one from Heathrow back to Calgary. Both flights were fantastic. Staff at check-in and onboard were friendly and courteous. We had many choices for meals black cod and a fatty cut of lamb were not prepared to our taste. The beef and the pasta were much tastier dishes. Thankfully fresh salad/balsamic dressing has been part of the business meal for a few years. Tasty desserts/cheese plates ensure that no one will starve. The pods are a comfortable way to travel and we always manage to have 4-5 hours of sleep. There's ample storage for shoes iPads etc plus a big bin overhead. There was a large selection of old and new movies to watch. The kit with travel amenities is fantastic on the way to Europe but of poor quality on the way back.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes
Emirates,10.0,Damiano Massimi,8th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Munich to Riyadh via Dubai. Both aircraft were in excellent condition, both from a maintenance and cleanliness point of view. The crew is friendly and offers a punctual and reliable service. The seats are exceptionally comfortable and guarantee very high privacy: there is plenty of space for the legs and for hand luggage and the division between the seats allows extra comfort. The Wi-Fi is free for every Skywards member. Since the registration to the program is also free, the service is very good. It is not the fastest one, but definitely with the best value for money. There is plenty of choice regarding entertainment. The ground service is exceptional: I forgot one bag on the plane and during the layover between the other connection the staff was able to retrieve my baggage and bring it to the lounge in time for the next flight.

Had to find another counter to talk to a different person, he dismissed us quickly with no help. Was able to find a woman that quickly told us the only way to take care of this to purchase a card there, extra $5 to get card. Flight attendants weren't friendly, but weren't rude. Then in Dallas, horrible. Plane was delayed, on the taxi way for over 25 min, only told it was maintenance issue. But worst part was the flight attendant. There were 2. 1 for coach 1 for first class.

United Airlines,1.0,B Dalidon,25th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Hong Kong via Newark. My flight BOS-EWR was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and I had a short connection in EWR to continue towards HKG. The customer service is unhelpful, as if the delay is your fault, not theirs. They refused to board me on an earlier flight, they could not offer re-routing nor sponsor the ticket with another airline to secure my journey. The delay was ultimately tight for my connection, but every UA representative I spoke to suggested the other flight would have likely waited. It did not. It left six minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite asking to the flight attendants while on flight whether my connection would have waited, the response was that United - differently from every other Star Alliance company - does not offer this ""service"". I landed and there was no representative to direct delayed passengers. I rushed to the gate to make the unpleasant discovery that my connection departed earlier. I thus went for the customer service. I stood on a line for 3h and 15m. Around 45 minutes after landing, a text message invited me to check-in for my next flight, from which I derived I was booked for the same flight the following day. After hours of waiting, I reached a representative that handed me a voucher for the hotel and US$ 30 for three meals: yes, $ 10 per meal. Not to mention, the hotel was sketchy and sub-standard. The flights were possibly the worst I have ever experienced in 14 years of flying. In over 16h flight (plus boarding, taxing, etc.) they serve two microscopic meals and one snack. No snacks in the galley. Never seen such misery. The crew was confrontational at all stages. They said: ""We are nice to people who are nice to us"", which is reasonable in abstract, but they seem to forget we are not fellow travellers! I am the customer, they are the flight attendants. As I have reached my final destination over 25h later than initially scheduled, I sought compensation from United. Unsurprisingly, their customer service is dismissive. I was told I can buy insurance next time. I do have insurance, but they cover unforeseeable events, not negligence of the carrier. I have been trying to hold them liable under the Montreal Convention, but so far all they offer are pointless vouchers in the illusion that I would ever subject myself again to the pain of dealing with such an unpleasant, unprofessional, unapologetic company. United airlines punishes you for making the unwise choice of traveling with them. Despite you pay for a service, they drop on you the cost of their inefficiency. Leaving aside old aircrafts, primitive forms of IFE that have disappeared in the rest of the world, broken controls, dirty and hard seats, meals that not even if you live out stamps. The point is the lack of consideration, the way they treat a paying customer at every stage of the experience, from check in to customer service when you try to claim damages for the disservice they caused you. Finally, UA cheats selling tickets with connecting time they cannot really respect or guarantee. They are cheating to rank higher on search engines with prices and journey duration. On any international flight, make sure you have 2.5h connecting time minimum. Few reviews will tell you UA is less worse than they say: don't gamble with it.

American Airlines,7.0,G Berenyi,21st January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Myrtle Beach to Boston via Philadelphia. I was on vacation and found out I needed to head home to Canada ASAP just two days before intended departure (mind you, this was New Year's Eve). I looked all over the web looking for tickets with many different airlines and agencies and found nothing but economy tickets at prices typical of first class. American Airlines also were full of ridiculously overpriced last minute seats, that is except for one route through PHL and BOS which were almost fully booked and therefore was a dirt cheap ticket even compared to normal season tickets. I jumped on the opportunity and booked my tickets via PayPal, which made everything much faster and simpler. Upon getting to the airport I realized I needed to buy a tag for my duffle bag in order to get it checked... not the most enticing thing but it was a fast process through the machine and was taken care of within a matter of seconds. Upon boarding, I was not expecting much, granted, this flight was American Eagle and they are not exactly renowned for premium service. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort the seat had, and the flight attendants were in a good mood as well. Complimentary service on the flights were the same, a bag of pretzels and drinks, but who needs more than that on a flight that's 1.5 hrs long? I might also add that having my connecting gate exactly next to my arriving gate in PHL was a very rare and warm surprise. Gate attendants were friendly and cheerful, and seemed to be level with what they were doing. In summary, American is by no means a high-class airline to me, but I guess I was lucky in having been under the care of some really great people and it was well worth the low cost of the ticket. In the future, American will definitely be on my radar if I need a cheap last minute deal fast!",E170 / A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MYR to BOS via PHL,December 2016,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,P Johnson,23rd July 2016,"San Francisco to Monterey with United. Of the 6 legs on a round trip flight, 5 were more than 2 hours late, crews and airport personel were rude and uncaring, this last flight from SFO to MRY was delayed 3 times and then cancelled at 1am leaving us stranded in SFO. The customer service reps said the most they could do was see if they could get some blankets for everyone, no refunds, no bus to get us home, no vouchers, nothing, most people ended up renting cars and driving to the destination. The explanation was 'weather', they gave this standing in front of a Doppler radar map showing no clouds or weather anywhere in the west and the plane was supposed to be coming from Burbank. People in line checked weather apps for Burbank, SFO and Monterey, it was clear and beautiful in all those places and everywhere in between. They use weather as the excuse so they don't have to refund the tickets because it's beyond their control. United employees are so rude it's obvious that they are unhappy and tired of lying to passengers.

Short connections flights should not be sold in my opinion. Apart from this, I flew with the B787 Dreamliner, a different story of comfort in Y class. Meal (sweet and sour chicken) wasn't exceptional, but the snack (quiche) was quite nice. Cabin crew is excellent. Couldn't expect any better.

Which the team outside the plane could not see. The agent at the desk then looked into why I wasnt on ""standby."" He then found he had to remove what customer service placed on my name to allow me to be put on ""standby."" This then put me one name away from getting on the next flight. After not being able to make it on that flight I thought customer service should know about what happened. I talked to a service agent that dismissed everything I told her. I ask to then speak to a supervisor. She did not treat me with respect or listen to what had happened. She only wanted me to know that policy said they did everything right. She also said she didnt know they had to explain that when the agents put you on ""standby"" it's not actually ""standby."" As a customer who flights often I assumed the airline would want to know how to better improve there customer service. She did not find this as a priority. The supervisor then was rude and nothing, but negative against the customer. I hope this review can help other individuals who are stressed that their flight is missed.

Qatar Airways,7.0,S Chim,25th September 2013,SIN-DOH-BRU and TXL-DOH-SIN. Food onboard was acceptable. Seats were fairly comfortable. Inflight service ranged from average to outstanding depending on the flight attendant. Inflight entertainment was very good. The problem was the transit at Doha it was nothing short of a disaster. The buses that take you to and from the terminal were excruciatingly slow and extremely packed. Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere. After having our boarding pass scanned for the transfer flight we took an escalator down to the waiting area in the bus bay. We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told. When the bus got to the plane surprise surprise the doors stayed closed and we stayed inside the packed bus for another 15 minutes. Only on the plane did the captain explain that the aircraft came in late resulting in the delay. I wouldn't want to do another transit in Doha again at least not until their new airport is completed.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

Toilets are extremely small but there is a disabled one available in premium economy. Overall excellent interaction despite missed connection due to another carrier. Overall I would always choose to fly with AirNZ if possible. Unfortunately let down by their alliance with United who are the antithesis of everything AirNZ is.

Business Class seat: worst seat ever seen on a long-haul flight. The seat is a very old recliner seat even not electronic but manual adjustment of seat position. Very uncomfortable.

American Airlines,1.0,Samantha Howard,22nd May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I was appalled by the last of service and poor treatment given to me by American Airlines today. I have an extra three hours to wait at the airport and write this review because I was bumped from my connecting flight without any notice or compensation. The first flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes due to mechanical issues. Apparaty a bird had crashed into the plane the night before. So rather than have the issue fixed before takeoff, they make an entire plane full of passengers wait on a hot, sticky plane for an hour. Because the plane departed late American Airlines rebooked all passengers with connecting flights. I was one of them, the problem is that my connecting flight was delayed so I made the flight with time to spare. The aircraft didn't even change, the same plane I took on the first flight was also the same plane I would have taken for the second flight. But did American Airlines care? No! They bumped me from the flight I was supposed to be on and gave my seat away. The flight was of course overbooked - as per usual for American Airlines. After being treated rudely by the gate manager I went to customer service to ask for a refund (I knew I wouldn't get it but hey, never hurts to ask) and was told the best he could offer was a $12 meal voucher. Wow. To contest this further I have to send them an email but I am sure I will never be compensated or given an apology.

United Airlines,5.0,K Ogao,24th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Houston. I've previously taken this route four years ago and I was expecting the same. Well, that wasn't the case. For a trans-pacific flight, the flight crew was not approachable or polite in any matter besides maybe two who did an excellent job. There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream. In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a ""rubber"" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie. The crew was not very presentable and mediocre, some of the crew looked like they just lazily put on their uniform without a care of how they looked. There were only two crew who had a smile on their face the whole flight. Some had the expression of regret for choosing their career as a flight attendant, some were just tired and wanted to go back to the crew rest, and some had great poise. The seat was rather decent for a 12-hour flight. Great legroom and recline degree and the cushioning are comfortable for sleep - there were even pillows and blankets. There was also an IFE screen on each seat but none of them worked the entire flight. The crew tried their best to reboot and get it to work but it wouldn't budge. No movies or TV programs would work but games and the flight map did. It was a good thing there was in-flight wifi which you can connect to use the United app where you can enjoy free entertainment with latest movies and TV shows free of charge. Before I went on this flight I flew into Tokyo Narita from Manila and arrived at Tokyo on-time at 2:50 PM but this flight was due to depart at 4:30 PM. So once I arrived my boarding pass didn't have info on the gate number but there was a United representative giving info specifically about that. Approachable and polite. The overall flight experience was decent - close to mediocre due to inconsistent cabin crew and meager cabin product compared to ANA who fly the same route on a higher level of service.",Boeing 777-200ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Houston,June 2017,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no

Delta Air Lines,,J Katnic,4th May 2014,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,no

I used to be a fan of Turkish Airlines, flew them several time and rarely had an issue - but that was about 2 years ago! Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage. And cherry on the cake, I've been stuck at home all day waiting for them to deliver my suitcases (were supposed to do it from 1pm to 6pm, then from 6pm to 8pm - it's 8:43pm and still nothing). I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet.

United Airlines,9.0,W Robert Kmen,7th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Beijing via Washington. This was an award business class flight ticketed four months ago -scheduled for SAS from Washington Dulles to Copenhagen and Air China continuing on to Beijing. When the SAS pilots went out on strike a week before my departure, everything was left up in the air, so to speak. I waited until the day before my flight in the hope that the Scandanavian labor dispute would be resolved, but my luck and time ran out. United Airlines had the first segment from TPA to IAD, and the award was booked through Mileage Plus, so I called their gold elite help line to attempt some sort of rescheduling. The customer service representative was patient in guiding me through several alternative options to Beijing. Connecting through Copenhagen was not possible, but she did manage to force open a business class seat on United's non-stop IAD-PEK. In fact, both flights were eminently pleasant, although 13 hours on any flight seems interminable. Both flights departed and arrived significantly early, and service onboard met my expectations for a long haul business class flight. Although our cabin was 100% full, the attendants hustled and provided attentive service. The elaborate meal on the flight to China was delicious and filling, although the beef main-course could have been somewhat hotter. In addition, United's 2x2x2 seating on the 787 is not the equal of the 1x2x1 arrangement I was anticipating on SAS. Nevertheless, the seat was quite comfortable. Special mention should be made of the bedding United offers in Polaris.

That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,,,,4.0,no
American Airlines,9.0,James Little,26th January 2015,London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) via Chicago (ORD) in First. Bag drop at LHR was easy. Flagship lounge a little antiseptic but welcoming enough. Boarding straightforward. Plane on the transatlantic section looked a little tired inside but the seat was enormous and very comfortable. Food and drinks very good and service outstanding. If I have a gripe it's that the IFE wasn't great and the TV of poor quality. Domestic leg was OK but I wouldn't expect the same class of treatment on such a flight.,,,First Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,8.0,David Ellis,5th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Cape Town to London via Istanbul. Itâ€™s a shame that Turkish Airlines use the Bidvest lounge at CPT because itâ€™s one of those pay-to-enter places thatâ€™s stuffed with passengers gorging themselves with food. Boarding for the CPT â€“ IST flight started an hour before take-off, which seemed excessive. The business class cabin has a utilitarian dÃ©cor of shades of grey â€“ no middle-eastern bling or graduated, coloured lighting here. The staggered 2:2:2 seating pattern affords reasonable privacy, although passengers in window seats still have to climb over their neighbourâ€™s legs.

All 3 flight during my one week vacation were delayed (4 hours the first one) The planes don't have enough in-cabin space to accommodate traveler's belongings. I had to check in my carry-on in the end. Service was about the worst I have ever experienced. Service was interrupted at one occasion due to turbulence, I asked for a coffee but since they could not serve hot beverages during that moment the flight attendant gave me an empty cup so that I can claim my coffee when the seat belt sign went off. Waited an hour for them to come see me (that little light to call assistance is useless on that flight because they ignore you). Once she came back, took my cup and that was the end of it.

Aegean Airlines,4.0,Dimitrios Zikos,14th January 2010,I have travelled many times with Aegean Airlines from Berlin to Athens Athens to Larnaca but also in domestic flights in Greece. In general I would say that it is a very good company as long as everything goes well and you DONT need anything from the customer support. In that case you have to wait for hours (sometimes days) for someone to pick up the phone quite often to tell you that she/he is not competent to respond to your question and as such your call will be forwarded. Surprisingly 9 out of 10 times nobody will pick up the forwarded call. Another malicious trick they are doing is saying that you should wait for the responsible person to call you. Something that may happen after a week or so if you get lucky. They also have the bad habit of not informing the passengers for delays or other unexpected event that may jeopardise the trip. I missed a flight once (one of the very few that departed that day) because the advice of the Athens airport information desk (Aegean did not pick up the phone or the line was busy from 9 in the morning till midnight) to to my question if the flight will be delayed-cancelled or not was to go at the airport four o'clock in the morning and hope that the flight will take place otherwise ask the Aegean people there. I didn't risk it. As a result I was waiting 4 months to get the taxes from the ticket back. There are also hidden charges as using the internet to book tickets involves a fee the same applies though if you book the tickets by phone.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,yes
American Airlines,1.0,Monet Young,16th October 2018,Not Verified | Buffalo to Charlotte. Worst airline to fly with! This is now our second time this year for our flight to be delayed causing us to miss our connecting flight thus missing very important events that we paid a lot of money to be at. To â€œaccommodate usâ€ they gave us a 10% hotel discount for a hotel that was over $150 a night and sent us on our way. Absolutely unacceptable. And now that Iâ€™m reading the reviews I see that itâ€™s a very common thing with this company.

American Airlines,1.0,H Marikova,9th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Madrid via Philadelphia. The worst airline I have ever used. Our flight from Philadelphia (which was a stopover) to Madrid was delayed because the IT people did not cross check the numbers against those on the actual plane. The delay was for more than 2hrs. Then an AA customer manager comes onboard and promises everyone on the plane that all our connection flights will be rescheduled automatically to the next available time by the time we reach Mardid. This was a plain outrageous lie. We were standing in an enormously long line at the AA desk at Madrid airport where basically all passengers from this flight went to, trying to get their connecting flights rearranged. Because nothing was arranged for anyone. In addition, we were told that all flights to the island were booked and they could not accommodate us on that day (we arrived around 10am in the morning). so they booked us for the next (!) day and put us in a hotel. Only the AA agent 'forgot' to tell us that there were NO SEATS and NO GUARANTEE that we were going to fly the next day! We nearly did not make it the next day because the flight was FULL! We had to wait with a little kid until everyone boarded and basically begged the staff to let us in. In addition, this flight was at 9pm which meant that we lost 2 days in Madrid, away from our main destination. In addition, our hotel in Tenerife did not cancel our missed day and we had to pay extra 500 Euros for the day we were not there. When we emailed the AA and asked them to reimburse us for the missed hotel day, cab rides that we did not intend to take, they rejected it stating that we simply had an inconvenience and nothing more than that. I am glad that we did not waste our money booking first class seats. Terrible AA agents across the board, whether in person in different countries, on email or on the phone! It is better to pay extra and book it via another airline than with AA!

United Airlines,3.0,B De Groote,24th April 2014,Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down. Probably the least service-centred flight I ever experienced.

United Airlines,1.0,Elise Engelking,15th March 2019,"Not Verified | San Francisco to Portland. The only thing United's wifi is good for is writing a bad review. They have terrible inflight entertainment because they expect you to pay $10.99 for barely any workable internet connection and require you download a plug in to enjoy movies/tv but make it absolutely impossible to find. So then you're stuck with no entertainment options at an unfair rate. To put in perspective, that's more expensive than my monthly Netflix fee. In addition, unlike other generous airlines, they require you pay for absolutely everything. You might think you are getting a bargain flight, but when checking out, you are required to pay extra if you want to sit with your family, extra if you want a carry-on rather than offering it complimentary, and they charge you for everything else offered on the plane. Surprised they don't have someone waiting outside the door demanding money for toilet paper. Bottom line, it is worth paying a bit more upfront to fly with a different airline than being surprised halfway through your trip when the expenses add up and you're feeling more and more agitated by the second.

Qatar Airways,7.0,A Beeby,28th January 2014,MAN-DOH-SIN return. All flights arrived on time but very poor boarding arrangements in DOH and SIN and mixed aircraft experience marred the trip! A330 is quiet and fairly spacious but was showing serious signs of age B777 was a much better flying experience with much more space and comfort and the B787 was a big let down. Despite the good mood lighting and darkened windows on the B787 the manufacturers seem to have used such flimsy and lightweight components that it just doesn't seem as if it is going to last. Plastic panels in three toilets were split as were two panels around the cabin window toilet seat broken in one sink blocked in two seats flex and creek and aisle is way too narrow. The cabin service was good and consistent throughout the food quality was mixed (as usual) champagne on flights from UK is a nice touch and decent wine served throughout remaining flights.

United Airlines,1.0,K Krebs,3rd August 2014,UA982 12/23/2013. United provided me with the worst traveling experience of my life. I spent 24 hours in Kuwait City airport after a cancelled flight. United gave me the run-around promising flight after flight which were all already overbooked. The only compensation I received was a complimentary hotel room. I got to the hotel at 1.30am and they took me back to the airport at 4am to catch a flight that was of course overbooked. I finally got a flight (on a different airline) 12 hours later. I understand that some circumstances simply cannot be helped. That is the gamble that goes along with travel.

American Airlines,1.0,John Dean,23rd February 2016,"American Airlines 1517 from Miami to Roatan 02/13/16 was unable to land in Roatan and diverted to Belize.The Captain made the appropriate call as the diversion was weather related. Upon landing the Captain said they had a warning light on an engine that needed to be addressed. This was a clear mechanical delay. After more than an hour we had not been fed and later we were given a sandwich and bottled water and boarded . We taxied for takeoff where we sat for a period of time and captain reported the engine light had again appeared so we taxied back to the gate and sat until the 2nd mechanical problem had been resolved. The Captain told us that wet could not reach Roatan as the airport curfew for landing was past and we were flying back to Miami. We were told AA Customer Service would meet us and make the necessary arrangements for the night and the return flight the next morning. When we finished going through Immigration and Customs and baggage and we had GREAT difficulty finding the ONE AA Customer Service person who was extremely difficult to deal with in terms of the arrangements for the night and next morning. We learned that there were no hotel rooms available. He gave us a voucher for the 9AM flight the next morning, a $12 voucher for dinner @ 11.45 pm and we learned from other passengers that we were to go to the 4th floor to an auditorium. Upon arriving there we were provided with a folding cot, a blanket that was too small to cover anyone over 5'8â€ tall, the room was no more than 65 degrees and filled with people on cell phones, very tired and crying children, and chain saw snorers through the night. Upon checking in the next morning after an extremely uncomfortable night the counter people had no idea who we were and why we needed re-ticketing. Upon landing in Roatan, I learned a piece of my luggage was still in Miami It was necessary for me to go to the airport to pick it up. AA Customer Service in Roatan does not appear to exist, at least not for us! We learned that those waiting for our plane to arrive for their return to Miami had been returned to hotel rooms and provided with dinner and breakfast at no expense!

On further enquiring one of the flight attendant revealed that the plane (Boeing 787) had the same problem coming in and since fixing it would mean delaying the flight, they chose not to fix it, or inform us. In fact, when we boarded we could see the entertainment menu but nothing was playing and the staff told us that it will work once we are in air. The flight attendants were seen only when the food service was taking place. They did not bother to do rounds to find out if somebody needed anything as the attendant call button was not working.

The policy has changed so much that it almost sounds like United doesn't want to retain cutomers anymore. On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins.

Pre clearance is way better since the re-configuration (well done Pearson) and I was in the lounge on a guest pass within 30 mins of entering the airport. Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network. The flight was fine with the usual beverage service and an on time arrival in Toronto. In the race for maximising profit and cheesing off customers - Air Canada wins first prize.

We talked to the United person at the gate which he changed our seats and were very helpful in accommodating and put us together. Once on the plane for the 11hr flight home the flight attendants were very rude. At one point we were snapped at because we hadnâ€™t filled out the entry to the US card on time. I believe she screamed at us and said â€œyou had 11 hours to do this.â€ Never been on a flight with such a display of rudeness from flight attendants.

American Airlines,1.0,C Kidd,18th May 2015,I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late â€“ â€˜to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representativeâ€™ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic â€“ two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical â€˜issuesâ€™ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual â€˜packagesâ€™ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky â€“ even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was â€˜betterâ€™ â€“ in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped â€“ the 777 clearly had not been â€˜spring cleanedâ€™ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the â€˜entertainment systemâ€™ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is â€˜company policyâ€™ to only fly American carriers â€“ and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,S Ancheta,29th May 2018,"âŒ Not Verified | San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda. I've had mixed feelings about this airline. I was careless enough that the ANA ticket that I purchased was actually operated by United Airlines. The horrifying experience with them starts from customer service. I telephoned them obtaining inquiries on how a less than 24 hour transit would handle baggage. I was informed that the baggage will transfer directly to my connecting flight (which was finally, and thank heavens, ANA from Haneda to Manila). The reservation agent said that connecting within 24 hour transit will not result the baggage to be claimed in HND and will be directly handled in MNL. Fine. We checked in Day of our flight with our luggage weighing less than 50 lbs, 5 luggage due to my star alliance gold status, along with my brother's normal traveler status. We were informed that the luggage will be offloaded in Haneda. This is a conflicting to the information I was provided few hours ago. The check in agent said ""You can just re-check in to your next flght"" I asked her, ""are you sure"", she was proud to answer ""NO"". Why suggest with utmost certainty to do such thing without verifying your sources. I had asked for supervisor and I was replied with ""We do not have a supervisor, he is busy!"" I am at my point of my fumes reaching to the airport's ceiling on the way how I am being handled. Finally, the supervisor at that time came and handled our baggage with manual baggage tags. The check in agent even uttered ""good luck in finding these bags"", while the supervisor gave her a blank stare. These words were also added to our fiasco Agent: There is no way I will write manual airport codes with these baggage tags, they will get lost for sure. (At least she cares about my baggage possibility of being lost). Agent: Your baggage cannot be held at the airport for security purposes. Really, security purposes? I will travel with my luggage for more than 12 hours (note it will go through a strict security check, hence, adding another 12 hours should not make any difference to impose threat to security. I am not sure why United continue to impress us with their undying no customer style of service. It was not United Airlines ticket that I purchased, it was under ANA but unfortunately, the operating flight was United. The check-in agent did not offer us any help that at least by reaching Haneda, a ground staff would assist us with our luggage to connect to another airline. I guess by customer's putting up their weak customer service to even lower than worst, keeps them in the market.

Air Canada told us we cannot get on due to the delay (but we saw the plane was still at the gate), so we had to fly the next day. Again, no apologies, customer service was rude and short. They gave us tickets for next day flight, but, we checked online, our flight did not leave until 30 minutes later! We could have enough time to catch our plane! The only reason I could think of is that they sold our seats to standbys. We were highly disappointed. They gave us dinner vouchers, $10 , but didn't tell us that it was too late for any meal.

According to the steward he could not sell the item to me unless I signed my card. I told him that for safety reasons I do not sign the card and this is a very antiquated rule since the cards now carry a chip. The 3 stewards made quite a scene because I refused to sign my card. After a while I simply asked them to leave me alone and reminded them that this is not a necessity. They all left mumbling to each other. On my return flight from BKK I showed up at the airport with 2 pieces of checked baggage. The staff at the counter told me I was only entitled to one bag and I would have to pay for the other. Of course I said no problem expecting a reasonable price. To my surprise the representative quoted me over 22,000 BHT for the bag. I told her I was only checking an extra bag and not an extra person. She explained that according to my ticket, I have to pay by the kilo per bag.

I asked hours earlier if they could schedule us on another airline and was told no it must be a KLM flight. We were told we had seats on the Milan flight and when we got there we were on standby. The woman who helped us at United in Milan was kind and got us seats. In the 14 hours we were at Florence airport we were given one voucher for a sandwich. After we got our booking for Milan we had to find and pay our own way and find a hotel. Florence airport only allows one hour of free wifi which we had used early that morning so we had to pay for that too. It was 11:30pm by the time we got to our hotel in Milan and cost about 500 Euros.

Instead, when checking in after the 24 hour time frame, you are assigned the next boarding place, which by then is far back in line. Better to just skip the fee and log in exactly 24 hours ahead, which we all know is a real pain. And if you try to get customer service to respond, be prepared for a 20 min hold on the phone, followed by a representative who could not care less.

Southwest Airlines,8.0,M Cave,9th July 2012,"I fly frequently for my business. Southwest usually has the cheapest fares and the fact that bags fly free. Their ""Open Seat"" boarding policy is a little different since they are one of the only airlines that have this policy. I do see both sides of the arguments where you like to know where you seating upon booking the flight but also love the freedom of choosing your own seat as you get on the plane. The earlier you check in the better the chance of getting the seat of your preference. I hardly ever experience rudeness from staff. Flight attendants often add in comedic little quips in their safety instruction demonstration which I saw as quite amusing.

Qatar Airways,9.0,W Harris,16th June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Taif to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. 8th June 2016 TIF to DOH A320 Excellent flight. No Business class seats so the leg was in First class. Catering excellent and service on board was second to none! The crew was extremely attentive hat off to the cabin services supervisor and her staff. The Food was superb and the in flight entertainment very good for short haul. The Qatar business lounge at Hamad airport was dry (no alcohol) because it was Ramadan. This for an international traveler transiting through an airport is a big thumbs down for me as I like a glass of wine with my meal. This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat. Qatar always provides me with outstanding service and I love flying only with them if where I am going is one of their routes. Well done to all the staff who took care of me on this flight.

Emirates,5.0,D Michael,20th August 2014,This was my first flight on both Emirates and the A380. Neither lived up to the hype. Emirates is trying to build a reputation as a premium carrier with budget prices but ultimately they failed in some crucial areas. The food was sub-par especially on the HKG-DXB leg where it was downright inedible. Flight attendants were reasonably efficient but neither particularly friendly nor very welcoming. The layover in Dubai was simply too long at 4 hours but the A380 requires extra time for transfer which brings me to the second major issue with Emirates. The A380 is a cattle carrier I will never fly again. Emirates loves those planes because they can fill them up and maximize profits with sheer volume of passengers. There are inherent flaws like the lavatories behind the cockpit that have staircases leading to them. This causes unnecessary risks and inconvenience to passengers. Another problem of course is that moving that many passengers requires extra time and increases the risk of delays and other mishaps. After an 18 hour journey we had to wait for an infuriating hour at the baggage carousel in MUC. This experience was repeated by friends who traveled on the same route a few days later. Even efficient HKG couldn't move the baggage in an acceptable time frame. For me that was not only the first flight on Emirates and the A380,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only thing I could say they should get their boarding process more efficient. Everyone was seated near the boarding counter (flight full or nearly full) we had been sitting there for an hour a person came in and told everyone to move we thought the gate had changed. No. We were moved outside the door past another counter and then had to line up show our boarding pass which part was torn off and then had to sit back where we were originally. Sat there for an hour. After all passengers were seated back where they were the staff member then proceeded to zap all the boarding passes it seemed like 6 times.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Rudd,4th January 2016,"Our Turkish Airlines flight from Mombasa to Istanbul (via Addis Ababa) was delayed. On arrival into Istanbul we had to queue for 2 hours to collect our boarding pass for our connecting flight. This meant we missed our connecting flight to London Heathrow. When we finally arrived at the front of the desk the man was very unhelpful and arrogant. He said he could not help us and that we must go to the ticket sales desk to rebook our flight. The process of getting a boarding pass should not take more than 2 hours! We were told that the flight had gone without us and that we must purchase a visa and exit the airport to go to the ticket sales desk to get a new ticket. After a further hour we arrived at the ticket sales office. We then queued for a further 4 hours (where people were fainting, arguing and children were being sick) we finally reached the desk. We were told that there were no flights to anywhere in the UK for 2 more days. Our return destination was not possible so we had to change our return destination to Manchester. After this, we were told we could collect our luggage from the lost luggage area. After waiting a further hour, the staff told us it was impossible to get our bags and were unhelpful. As a result we still have no luggage. After this we had to join the hotel booking queue which took another hour. We have been left with no luggage, no clothes, no toothbrush, no toiletries and no warm clothes in a snowy environment. The customer service for Turkish Airlines at Istanbul airport has been the worst experience of our lives. The airline have been completely disorganised, unhelpful and at times very rude. The staff are unprepared and spoke minimal English. People should not have to wait in queues for hours without being provided water or seating. People with children were not assisted appropriately. We were treated like dogs for a problem that could have been sorted appropriately and efficiently. We hope that our flight tomorrow is on time. We have missed 2 days of work which we want compensation for. We also have a car parked at Heathrow airport (our original destination) which we will have to try and get as our destination was changed due to their incompetence. We will never fly with Turkish Airlines again. I cannot believe they have been voted the best airline in Europe. The way they have treated people is disgusting and an outrage. We hope they are ashamed of their service. We just hope our luggage turns up eventually",,,,,,,,,,,,

The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard even in Economy nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient as the system doesn't show altitude speed (ground and air) flight heading wind speed and direction and such stuff.

In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline. I fly to Australia at least once a year - I'll be looking at alternative airlines from now on.

I was informed that I would have to pay $250 to purchase a new ONE WAY ticket home. I paid less than that for the round-trip flight.

This went on for 3 more attendant passes me before I was able to get the attention of an attendant.

I purchased a basic economy which does not include luggage, but was told if I get a United Airlines credit card, I would get the first bag free.

Not only that, I could not check in my very small backpack on wheels because basic economy does not allow any carry on that fits in the overhead bin. No matter how much money I was willing to pay extra to keep my very small bag, smaller than airline regulation size bag with me, it was not an option and I had to pay $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second checked bag.

United Airlines,1.0,J Marden,14th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Washington DC. Basic Economy: Beware! Even if your bag fits under the seat, the box the airline uses to verify the size of your luggage is smaller than the area under the seat, and United will try to scam you out of $55 at the gate and force you to gate-check your bag -- even if the United attendant at the counter issues you a boarding pass, and has no problem with your bag. That is probably because they only charge $30 at the counter if you decide to check your bag then- but squeeze an additional $25 out of you for any bag they force you to check at the gate. I was stopped halfway down the breezeway, after the gate attendant had already scanned my boarding pass and told me to have a good flight. I was ready to throw away my belongings before I would allow United to scam me out $55. Fortunately, the attendant eventually let me board with my small backpack. I had already spent $17 to UPS some of my belongings home, so my luggage contained even less than when I had flown TO my destination. That was also Basic Economy on United -- and neither the counter attendant nor the gate attendant had had any issue with my backpack for that flight. I will never again fly United. Other airlines have Basic Economy -- but those rules are much less restrictive and those carriers do not treat their passengers nearly as poorly. United treats you like chattel. Also: my ticket was not even inexpensive!!! I had already paid more than I usually do for a ticket to Fort Lauderdale, which was why I had decided not to upgrade from Basic Economy or pay extra for luggage.

Air Canada,1.0,Sheldon Banta,24th November 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | My original flight would have taken me from Dallas to Montreal to Vancouver to Melbourne. My problems started when I was not allowed to place my bag into an overhead compartment on my first flight leaving from Dallas because of a lack of available space. After checking my bag at the gate and boarding the plane I observed a flight attendant access her belongings which had been conveniently placed in an overhead compartment inside the passenger area of the aircraft. My next flight leaving Montreal was delayed 90 minutes due to engine problems which forced me to miss my connection in Vancouver. I was then rebooked on a flight to Sydney which was delayed for 60 minutes. When boarding the plane in Vancouver I noticed I had not been placed in a seat with upgraded leg room which I had paid for months before. When I inquired as to why I was not in a seat with more legroom I was told the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done. Upon arriving in Sydney I was met by an employee who advised I would be unable to make my connection flight from Sydney to Melbourne and handed a new ticket for a different flight. While in Sydney I found out that my luggage was still in Vancouver. I did not receive my luggage for 48 hours. After boarding my first flight leaving Melbourne there was a power issue forcing us to be grounded for just over an hour. This caused me to again miss my connection in Vancouver and Air Canada wanted to rebook myself and other passengers on another Air Canada flight. The problem with that was our original flight was from Vancouver to Dallas and they now wanted to rebook us on other non direct flights. After voicing my concerns I was booked onto an American Airlines flight in order to fly directly from Vancouver back to Dallas. Upon returning to Dallas I was again informed that my luggage did not make it to the new plane and was still in Vancouver. I filed a complaint online on November 18th after all the problems arrived getting to Australia. I contacted customer service since customer relations does not have a phone number on November 22 to check on the status of my complaint. I was informed by customer service that there was no way for me to speak with someone over the phone in customer relations and my complaint could take up to 40 days to be investigated. Iâ€™m confused as to how this air lines could have made so many mistakes in such a short amount of time on every single one of my flights.

The staff were unsmiling and unfriendly to passengers. Meals were slow and on both legs one of the meal options was not available by the time they got to us. On the second occasion I refused the meal offered as I didn't want another stew and I had had enough. I was eventually provided with the meal I wanted but it was put down with ill grace. My partner is vegetarian but he is not vegan. Surely Emirates could provide for both and not treat vegetarians as vegan? His meals were awful and inadequate and he had to have my cheese and biscuits as he was left hungry.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BHX to BNE via DXB,October 2015,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,no

Qatar Airways,7.0,J Fairclough,17th March 2015,BCN to KUL via DOH. All flights on A-330 200 . The seatmaps for this type of plane are a little misleading. They all show the 4 rows of Biz Class in one large block but the reality is rows 1-3 are in the forward cabin and strangely row 4 only is on its own in a very small section between the Galley and Econ section. My wife and I were seated in seats 4 J+K. It does feel pretty private but of course you are more prone to any noise from kids etc behind in Econ. I guess you pays your money and takes your choice! Food copious and excellent quality on all flights but they can be a bit slow in refilling wine glasses. Even these refurbished A330's are beginning to show their age and frankly the seats are rather lumpy and not all that comfortable even when fully flat. Whilst the boarding at both KL and Barcelona was fine I have to say I was disappointed with that at Doha. 3 out of the 4 flights to or from there were from outlying stands not jetways. I really find it hard to see how with a brand new airport that trumpets itself as one of the world's best that so many flights involve a long trek followed by being herded onto a bus and having to climb steep steps to board . That sort of thing may have been OK on a charter flight to Majorca from Luton in the '80s but really does not cut the mustard in 2015 on a Business class ticket on a supposedly 5* airline!

Their English was ""eh"" but if you're leaving the states anyway it's really a moot point by then. I believe most of their flights are routed through IST, which I found an easy airport to navigate.

American Airlines,1.0,D Porter,4th November 2018,Not Verified | Two thumbs down for American Airlines. I flew American round trip from San Francisco to Costa Rica recently and though there were a few redeeming moments with them on the whole I would never recommend or choose American. Of the 4 flights (connecting included) there were stressful delays on each one and re-routing and departure time changes which added considerable travel time and made me miss appointments. My main complaint is that American seems to use scented air freshener in their cabin air system which every hour or so would come blasting through into the cabin. I happen to be physically very sensitive to chemical air fresheners and I know for certain that there are many people who are sensitive. We are trapped in the capsule at the mercy of someones decision to use this toxic scent (whatever it is). I got off the plane feeling ill and with lung irritation. My partner could smell it on me when giving me a ride home. He too is sensitive and it gave him a headache just from my clothing. It seems we are living in a new culture of air scenting from laundry detergent to garbage bags and everything in between. Hopefully they will realize that this is a bad move. Also because of their delay in one of my days of travel I did not have time to eat in my connection airport as I had to run to the gate. I was prepared to purchase food on board the 2nd flight of my journey only to find out they didn't have food to purchase (between Dallas and San Jose) which was the longest leg of my flight. Instead they had a wimpy and junk food like snack offering. What was with that? Also the headphone jack was broken on one of my flights so I couldn't use the onboard entertainment for a 6 hour flight. Overall I think American is the worst airline I've used and I travel fairly frequently.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San JosÃ© to San Francisco via Miami,November 2018,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no

Alitalia,10.0,Catalin-Alexandru Epure,12th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Santiago de Chile to Berlin via Rome. Because the economy fares around Christmas and New Year were pretty expensive, I got an business class ticket for Alitalia, going from TXL to EZE and back from SCL, which was almost half of the price a normal trip like this would cos in business. I was a little afraid Alitalia will go bankrupt before my flights but I did risk it and the service I got was worth the money. The business class inside Europe is not a big deal, the legroom a little more and a meal served which was good. On the long haul side, it was almost perfect and I think this is how flying was used to be back in the 90s or 2000s. A lot of legroom, the seat turns into a bed, a huge screen with pretty good entertainment program, a lot of attention from the crew. The only downside I had was that the food portions (although incredibly delicious) were very small and don't fill you up.

Emirates,7.0,A Kabir,12th August 2016,"London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai flying with Emirates in economy class. There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite. At Dhaka our baggage took at least two hours to come even though in the domestic terminal we had another flight with a different airline 2 and a half hours after landing.

Our origin flight was delayed getting into Toronto so we had to run to make the boarding time for our destination flight. Although, we made it to the flight they would not allow us on because our bags did not make it. We waited 2 hours from 11pm to 1am to get our hotel voucher, and had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. We were not allowed to get our bags. Our hotel was for one night with an 11am checkout, so from 11am to 11pm we had to wait at the airport. We get to our final destination, and one of our bags actually did make it on the original flight so had been waiting for us there, but the other somehow didn't make it on either. We then waited 48 hours to get our second bag delivered to us. So, we were without much of luggage for 72 hours (great way to start a trip in dirty clothes). It was strange how we flew to Dublin on a plane that didn't have any of our baggage on it when the day before we were told the that we weren't allowed to board because our bags wouldn't be travelling with us. Flight back from Dublin via Newark. We had a 3 hour layover which turned into 4.5 hours due to a delay. Then the captain advised that due to a navigation system failure on the plan it will be delayed another 2 hours. Two hours later the captain comes back and says the flight is cancelled. Customer service agents tell us it was cancelled due to weather so no vouchers (weird how the captain had just told us otherwise). We know we missed our connecting flight so asked for hotel (it was 6pm). They make us wait until 11pm to fly Toronto, then, I wait there until 2am to get hotel voucher. We had been traveling since 1am EST. Get back to final destination, and our bags were still in Newark. Again, very odd how they let us on the plane without our bags.

I booked this last minute due to Air Berlin going bankrupt and cancelling our flights. Had some hesitation, but overall I had a good experience. Premium economy rate was reasonable, however seat choice was problematic. The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat. The waiting room in Moscow airport are small, I would find an empty waiting area and head to our terminal once we are closer to boarding.

Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice.

One whinge Emirates (and other airlines) really need to police their hand luggage policies. I'm sick of having my reasonably sized cabin bag under my feet because some selfish person has put a suitcase in the overhead locker.

United Airlines,1.0,C Caldwell,3rd July 2014,"I switched from Southwest airlines 5-6 years ago. Logged around 180K miles since joining Continental/United. A while back I used most of my balance of miles to reward myself with a trip to Vegas for me and my wife. First Class there and coach back. Purchased at least a month in advance checked in the day before received tickets with our seat assignments while checking our bags. So far so good. At the gate they informed us that United overbooked First Class-still plenty of seats on plane-just overbooked First Class-not sure how you do that-since the odds of ""no shows"" happening with FC seats has to be rare. I understand overbooking the plane but not a section. We were told since we did not purchase the tickets with money we were the lucky losers. Someone gave up their seat which put my wife in first class and me in the back. Five years of loyalty resulted in a final reward of getting split up to start our vacation.

Air Canada,5.0,P Rubenstein,15th January 2016,"YUL-YYZ departure did not go well. AC canceled my flight and rebooked me on an earlier flight. This was done with no notice sent to me. The end result is that I nearly missed my flight and managed to make it by running to the gate. To ensure my bag would make the flight, the agent at checking told me to take my bag to oversized. Had I not been traveling at an off peak hour I would have missed my next flight to Taipei and been stuck in YYZ for 2-4 days waiting for room on the next available flight. The cabin was filled with AC personnel, who took up most of the overhead compartment space, making it difficult to find any space. The flight was fine otherwise with polite service from the FAs. YYZ-YUL: Was able to go and standby and to get an earlier flight (which departed late). The connections agent was helpful. At the gate, it was one agent professional and the other miserable and rude. Again, due to off peak travel time, delays and crowding were much better than usual. Flight was full, but FAs maintained a professional approach. As a very welcome surprise, baggage arrived in a timely manner on both flights.

The flight was overbooked and some people were subsequently bumped. We paid 25 dollars each way for luggage but loads of people who had brought large hand luggage were then made to check them in but for free.

Aeromexico,2.0,M Fitzgerald,22nd January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I travelled with Aeromexico to Medellin Colombia and on arrival my bag was not there. After talking to an Aeromexico service desk , I was told the â€˜systemâ€™ was down so She could not track my bag. So I asked to fill out a lost luggage form - I did this (with my friend who speaks Spanish as her native language) and was told to call the Aeromexico Medellin number the next morning. My bag was never found and after 21 days I was told to compile a list of the items in my backpack , along with receipts and that I would receive compensation for all items with receipts and 25% of the value for the items without receipts. I did this and from what I was told - I was eligible for almost $2,000 in compensation. I received an email back informing me I was not eligible for compensation because the report was â€˜made by courtesyâ€™ . I replied asking for further explanation and received no response, I called the Medellin line and they told me it must be a mistake and to send the email again. I did this and received the same response , again I asked for further explanation and received nothing. When I checked my bag in st Mexico City - the attendant was slow and rude to both me and my Colombian friend. My friend saw him ticket my bag but we found out later that he did not give us the corresponding tickets for the bag. Itâ€™s extremely shady, and although I still donâ€™t have an explanation - it seems that the attendants did not give me the correct forms to fill out or did not enter my missing bag into the system. To Make an insurance claim I have to prove I have made all lengths with the airline first. This is impossible as the phone lines never answer and there email correspondence is ridiculous. Even as a budget carrier I expected more. At the very least and explanation and compensation for my immediate expenses - I was left with nothing and lost many items not just of financial value but personal too.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Medellin,November 2018,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,3.0,no

I called them later date and asked for a resolution. The representative held me up wating for 20 mins and finally said that he can refund partial amount. I asked him whether he can put me back on my initial departure location and he again held me waiting and spoke to higher authorities and finally said it's possible and we are at the verge of reserving my flight back to location where i started. I opted for seat preference and the guy told me to wait again and came back after couple of minutes and said that they can't make this reservation at all. We had conversation against the assured resolution and finally ended up with no resolution at all. I spoke to the higher supervisor with whom he was talking before and she said that they gave me misinformation providing me with the refund process application.

The staff were pretty professional but that is common among airlines. I was initially excited to be flying in an A380 for the first time but the moment I boarded, my heart sunk. It was obvious Emirates had chosen the the cheapest possible configuration that you would expect on a budget domestic airline. The seats were super low quality and grubby. There was next to no padding which made it painful for a 14 hour flight. The air was dry, but worse is the LED lighting which has a low Hz flicker. This becomes migraine inducing as the lighting splits into green blue and red as you move your eyes about. There is also an insufficient number of toilets available.

This flight was on a Boeing with Sky Interior which had bigger bins and private TVs on every seat with a wide selection of movies. For this flight I chose row 29 since the last few rows offer an extra seat of legroom. After take off people were offered bottles of water, about thirty minutes after that beer, spirits, sodas and juices as well as a bag with peanuts or some sort of trail mix. Since I was in the back I had no choice on dinner but at least food is free. I was offered pasta with veggies and cheese, yoghurt, beer, salad and bread, there was another drink service mid flight and prior to landing more water bottles were offered.

On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates.

Air New Zealand,1.0,D Teadem,28th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to London return. Paid extra for the Premium Economy seats. When boarded appalled that had to turn sideways down the aisle. From a safety standpoint I don't know how this is allowed, because in an emergency there is no room for rendering medical aid or even to evacuate properly. The aisle narrowness also proved a problem later when I tried to sleep (I am a thin lady and don't spill over seat sides) and I was constantly banged into by crew and passengers going down the aisle. The seats are narrow and uncomfortable, the premium seats have a leg rest below the seat that lifts up and provides no comfort other than take away more space and leg room. These seats would only work if there are two family members of small stature seated in the three seat row by themselves otherwise they are useless. As it was my knees were up against the front seat and if the passenger in front reclines their seat you can't eat off your tray and well you feel crushed. On the flight back my seat recline button was broken and I couldn't sleep. The passenger in front of my mother reclined their seat after they had served coffee and it went all over her clothes and ruined them. I have been on budget flights such as Ryan Air and been more comfortable. This is unacceptable for a long haul flight costing as much or more than other airlines in this category. I flew Air New Zealand 7 years ago and it was the best airline I had ever flown and recommended them to everyone. It was the only reason I chose them again and I wish I read the reviews on this site before booking them over Virgin Atlantic or British Airways. I will never fly Air New Zealand again or recommend them to anyone. Look at the photos I have attached and you can see for yourself. I feel sorry for the crew having to work in such cramped quarters and especially for the passengers who were continuing on to Auckland. Oh and there is a feature on the inflight entertainment that allows you to order snacks drinks from your seat. This feature was only ever activated for a period of 30 minutes on each flight. I think this was done on purpose by the flight attendants due to having to navigate up and down those ridiculous aisles. Shame on you Air New Zealand.

Lufthansa,1.0,P Hester,19th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Manchester via Frankfurt. The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'.

Emirates,1.0,D Holden,5th March 2014,EK 372 on 27th Feb 2014. We have flown regularly with Emirates for many years and have been very happy. The way the airline dealt with us following the alleged baggage system crash on 27th Feb was appalling. Despite the fact that aircrew know that most passengers baggage had not been loaded no information was provided during the flight or at the airport. Instead we were left forlornly waiting at the carousel. By the time people twigged what was happening the two ground staff at the information desk were besieged. They were totally unprepared and chaos ensued. Essentially people were abandoned to their own devices with no attempt to communicate or put contingency arrangements in place. This was a repeat of our experience last year which we attributed to a one off aberration. Frankly you can have all the comfort and good food you like but if your customers walk away feeling angry and frustrated you will not get repeat business.

Air Canada,8.0,Vineet Bapat,20th February 2014,Zurich to Toronto (Flight 879 on Feb. 13) on a rather ageing tired Boeing 767 - however it was not a full flight so we could easily change our assigned bulkhead seats to two by the window in an exit row - which afforded us great legroom. FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart.

But beyond that this was the best possible option and a referral to the complaint form, we did not arrive. Additional hotel accommodation was not offered. So I had to book myself. We are not informed about any refund or compensation. I have because I could not afford this delay to book a ticket with another company of â‚¬ 400!

She kept answering my questions like: No, no and no! She never smiled, never! I mean like it was a bad experience checking in. I'd give the flight crew somewhere between 8 to 9 out of 10.

From the moment you arrive at the check in you have the most luxurious airport lounge featuring an extensive range range of fine food, drinks and services. As you board the uppper deck business class cabin your greeted with the feeling you have just walked on board a luxury yacht. From the wood finishes to the quality seating, entertainment and food you do feel as though it's the flight and not the destination that you are more interested in. And they dim the lights and to show ceiling stars. I would be amiss if I left out the professional staff that serve you.

Qatar Airways,3.0,S Kerr,8th March 2016,"The customer service were rude both in the airport and on the telephone - I tried by email but they took around a week to reply to each email which they had clearly not read. I found the legroom was not enough. The cabin crew don't do any kind of beverage service, you kind of have to get their attention to get a drink. As for the in-seat entertainment although there is a good choice of stuff to watch, the screens use a touch-screen control which doesn't seem very sensitive, meaning you get people tapping the back of your seat with a great deal of force - not great if you want to sleep. The screens are actually a bit too big, meaning if the seat in front goes back it's so much in your face it's not pleasant.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to CMB via DOH,February 2016,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no

SU does not serve alcohol on economy class for the BKK-SVO route. Onboard food has nothing special to mention about. Limited drinks and entertainment choices.

American Airlines,1.0,Cody Rodrigo,21st July 2018,"Not Verified | Philadelphia to Atlanta. Absolutely horrible. Not only was my flight delayed by 4 hrs than its original departure time of 5:30, but they also left the lights on the airplane the entire ride from 9:30 to 11:30 while most passengers wanted to sleep, this prohibited a lot of passengers including myself from sleeping. The only snack your offered are pretzels. I also didn't get my bag about 12 to 12:30. The constant delays were unreal. I didn't get settled at home until 1:30 in the morning, which caused problems for me the next day. Then when I opened my luggage the next day it was clear that my luggage was handled extremely poorly. I wrapped a glass picture frame in clothes so it wouldn't get damaged in flight as I've done before with delta without a fragile sticker being placed on it and with delta it would always be fine, when I opened my bag the frame was shattered and the broken glass had ruined my picture. There was also a 10min delay getting off of the plane. Then when I went to the train to go to baggage claim, the train was very slow, not just arriving to pick us up at the gate, but moving to baggage claim.

In both Amsterdam as well in Oslo I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. Both flights were the typical KLM short haul service consisting of a pre-packed sandwich and a cup of coffee. What always strikes me is the difference in attitude between the mainline KLM and Cityhopper crews. The outbound flight to Oslo was operated by KLM Cityhopper EMB 190, a full flight with only 2 enthusiastic flight-attendants who managed to do 2 drink runs. The return flight was a 80% filled Boeing 737 with one purser and 4 male flight-attendants which were very busy studying their iPads during boarding.

Also love the online ordering on the seatback TV but wish they stocked just a few more fresh food options (usually you get a choice of a couple of light options such as wraps and salads but wish they would have more substantial choices to choose from). Also the powerports at every seat really makes a difference. One small detail that is easily overlooked but which I greatly appreciate is the Google Maps feature that tracks where your plane is.

Then she proceeded to sit where I could clearly see her reading a magazine and eating - very professional.

They had a few and was handed out for people who requested them. The food was good and the flight attendants were as always very attentive. On landing though we had to take a bus from the aircraft to the terminal. This caused a lot of people to panic and run to their connections.

The second leg was a longer flight - this time the aircraft was newer and the seat back entertainment system was of higher quality. Meal service was good and timely. They served two main meals with a snack in the middle. As always the flight attendants were very attentive. Unusually they ran short of the lamb option! As for the seat - my seat was very uncomfortable. It was behind an exit row. Both the seat anchor from the front seat and the seat back entertainment system took away a major portion of the foot space. Had to find an angle to sit for the whole 12 hour journey.

Some very nice service but mostly very unfriendly rude horrible service people work for United. On way back same thing. Two hour delay for final destination and had to get another room waiting for guess. Which led us to meet another rude service person in customer service dept.

American Airlines,1.0,S Tuft,13th June 2015,"I flew non-stop from SLC to MIA on a redeye, 4 hours of flight time, no problems, delighted to find a non-stop flight. A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience. The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us. Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC, and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm. I made it in time to board this different flight, but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm. The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason. Still, I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight, but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have, and I don't see how it could be, that every single AA flight I was on that day, all had delays.

American Airlines,3.0,Mark Jensen,7th March 2016,"There is no doubt that American carriers in general lag behind their European, Middle Eastern and Asian counterparts in anything from service, equipment to entertainment. On my recent flight on American Airlines it came to a new low at least as far as entertainment is concerned. The available selection and more so the interface is not something I expected to see on a Boeing 777. The movie selection was minuscule, even compared to carriers such as United. The New release selection comprised a handful of features and most of them weren't even that new. The features are not ""on demand"" they have a cycle and you have to either watch what is in progress or wait for the next feature to start. The food in general is mediocre but since my flight originated in London it is probably better than if I had started my trip in Miami. Generally speaking I find that the quality of food on US carriers is better coming out of Europe rather than arriving into.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to MIA,February 2016,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Jake McCall,7th February 2014,Jan 18 my wife son and I flew to Sarasota. The trip down was ok although we've never encountered such uncomfortable seats as that flight. The trip back on Feb 1 was awful. We arrived at Sarasota early expecting to catch the flight at 6pm-ish back to Toronto. When asked if the flight was on time the attendants answered 'no it'll be leaving Toronto an hour later than scheduled.' As time went by it became clear that not only was the flight not going to leave an hour late from Toronto it was actually in transit from Orlando to Toronto. Eventually the flight (1881) arrived in Sarasota at roughly 11pm and after disembarking passengers and cleaning left at roughly 11.30pm. The flight eventually arrived in Toronto by now it's roughly 2.30am and everyone is exhausted. Eventually we reached our home in downtown Toronto at roughly 4am.

Compared to the Economy class the Business class seats are very comfortable allowing to stretch completely and have a nice rest so that the flight time seems to be much shorter.

Over two hours into the flight to Erbil when I thought we were already descending, it was announced that we couldn't land and were heading back to Istanbul on account of fog. This meant a 24 hour wait in the airport until the next flight which then was delayed another 90min. Then after everyone had boarded, two buses pull up, ""flight is cancelled"". At this point I could no longer wait, and had to fly back to Berlin. My original return would have been the day before. I spent two hours at the Turkish Airlines transfer desk with a lot of insisting and nerves to finally get this changed at the last minute to the next plane on the same day. The services there was just awful (around 1300 on Dec. 19). Initially I was told, ""everything's ok, just sit there, and we will deliver the ticket to you."" But as time went on and no one came, I had to go back to the desk and basically start from scratch, dealing with altogether 5 or six officials who spoke hardly any English and were disorganised to the point of reminding one of headless chickens.

I fly 2-5 times a year and I thought this was strange, I had never heard of this before on any airline. The day before our flights I received an email from Delta that they had changed the times of all of our flights. We booked our flights at specific times because we were meeting another couple in New Orleans. because of the flight change they were going to have to sit in the airpot for 2 hours waiting for us. When we arrived to check in they tried to bump us to an even later flight. on our connecting flight they did the same thing. On the return flight our plane arrived early but the gate was damaged and we had to be towed to another gate. This caused us to miss our connecting flight leaving us stranded in the airport for more than 4 hours.

She did come back - passed my seat many times including asking for drinks - but never mentioned the seat change request again, even though I was visibly unable to get good air and was basically crawling out of my seat. The seatbelt sign stayed on for the first 1.5 hours of the flight even though the air was calm and clear and we had long since flown out of the storms. Did the pilot forget to turn it off?

My boyfriends passport is slightly water damaged, but scans where we go. It has never not scanned until last night, but it wouldn't scan at the terminal.

And then we are about to board in Toronto to go to Reykjavik and its no longer acceptable , why were we allowed to enter into Canada? So we proceeded to try to talk to the women who told us she couldn't do any thing because it wouldn't scan. And proceeded to tell us to go to customer service to see what can be done. So we have to leave the terminal and go through border control, so my boyfriend hands over his passport to the man working the counter, and now my boyfriends passport will scan. The young gentleman at the booth suggested she wasn't holding it on the machine long enough for it to read. So she refused us for a $2000 flight we booked.

Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no

At gate, was told that a new aircraft was being flown in. After waiting 3 hours was told that the aircraft was used for another flight instead. Re-routed via MIA on flight that got us to SJU seven hours later, which meant we missed an entire day of vacation. After asking about our bags (nobody communicated anything prior) had to reclaim bags and recheck with just 30 mins before MIA flight departed.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Rohith Jayawardene,15th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,Tercon Bojan,14th January 2015,I'm amazed that a 737-800 can fly 6 hours and 20 minutes which is how long this flight from Istanbul to Nairobi was. Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times. This is a great plane for continental flights but am not convinced it works for 6+ hour overnight flights.

After having received no email invitation to check in for this flight, I called the UAL phone number to check in. I notified the agent that I was extremely dissatisfied with the seat comfort (legroom) on my last flight and requested an upgrade. He offered an upgrade for $99 and refused to change my seat until I paid this. I paid it, but the process took over 20 minutes when he was unable to communicate well enough to take down my billing information (both the CC number and the address were taken incorrectly more than once). His English was only marginal. The process was extremely aggravating and I resent being required to pay extra for adequate legroom. If the airline had clearly communicated their available legroom on the original booking, I would have booked another airline with more. I will spare no effort to avoid flying United Airlines again.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Shaun Casey,2nd September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. Itâ€™s the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that Iâ€™ve ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. Iâ€™m amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it canâ€™t even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience.

Delta Air Lines,7.0,L Tran,3rd November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York JFK to Frankfurt. When I left the Sky Club in JFK terminal 4 and headed to the nearby gate roughly 10 minutes before boarding, I got a text from Delta that the departure gate was changed. It was a non-issue unless the new gate was in terminal 2, and the only way to get there was by bus. To make things more confusing, the text did not advise me where I could take the bus, which departed from another gate. When I made to T2, an old, small and overcrowding facility, the flight was delayed because they needed to transfer the food, which had already been loaded to the original aircraft at the original gate, to the new aircraft (?). I ended up arriving at Frankfurt late, and the delay was not caused by weather or any technical issue. Reading many reviews here, one can easily notice that many complains about US carriers are about delays and how the airlines handle the situation, and that was what exactly happened here with Delta. The 767 perhaps has the best economy class seating arrangement, with only 1 per row that is not either a window or an aisle seat. The 767-400 used for my flight had the old version of IFE which was not that great (Delta's 767-300ER had better, newer IFE). I paid for wifi (the free version never works) and it worked fine. Service and food were fine. Crew distributed bottle water after meal (without us asking) which I think was a nice touch for us to stay hydrated throughout the flight.

But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffÃ¨t of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude.

My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class. I felt sorry for her as she was attentive a hard worker and did her best but had to comply with a restrictive mandate working for an airline that has a lot of room to improve.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,L Mcmahon,26th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I had an absolutely terrible experience with this airline. Originally my flight was delayed and at the gate we were being told that we were going to be able to board soon. The pilot would come on and keep pushing the boarding time back. Finally after spending over almost 5 hours waiting to board we were told that our flight was rescheduled and we wouldn't be able to leave until that evening. I was hours away from home and extremely upset. The customer service representative that I spoke to was extremely rude and claimed that there were no sooner flights with any other airline. I asked her to check and she kept saying that there was nothing. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she actually told me ""no I had to listen to her first"" before I could be transferred. When I eventually got in contact with a supervisor (45 minutes later) I requested to file a complaint in regards to how I was being treated. The supervisor refused to give me anyone's names, employee ID numbers, or any type of reference to my complaint and claimed it'd be noted on their file. After over two hours on the phone trying to get the issue resolved/being told they checked numerous times and no sooner flight was available I went online and found a sooner flight within 5 minutes! They claimed that they didn't see that flight and I was rescheduled for it. The whole ordeal was mentally and physically exhausting as I spent the whole day at the airport and ended up missing a day and a half of my trip to Budapest!

Suddenly, she got up and made an announcement about passengers moving upstairs to rebook their flights. As the passengers were told to follow the person leading the way upstairs, she followed behind. I was with her as she clipped my boarding pass on her card board. Then when we reached upstairs I was still walking with her slowly matching her pace. We talked on the way and she only assured me that I am not to worry. I reminded her that my boarding pass is with her and she simply handed me my boarding pass. I was now the last person in the queue. I waited for 2 hrs 30 min for my turn. She was around but my turn fell in with the other representative. I explained her my flight details and college scene again. She first told me that she will book me in the flight to Indianapolis via Washington. Then she told me that she will not be able to do that because I have two separate bookings and that she is not able to merge. In fact, she also told me that she will not be able to provide me with an accommodation when the passengers right next to me on the other counter same class ticket and same flight were being provided accommodation because they spoke on the helpline phone number.

Cabin of the A330 is extremely outdated and tired, I presume many airlines that fly to Africa use their oldest, clapped-out planes. The seat was not very comfortable, the screen for entertainment was tiny, perhaps 10 cm across. Other than more legroom, there are no perks in Premium Economy. Service was perfunctory, which is what I am used from KLM. What was really annoying was a medical emergency, which led us to divert to Luxor. As a doctor, I offered my help, but it appears the decision had already been made, and we stopped in Luxor for about 4 hours to offload a passenger. This went on for 2 hours, then a further two hours wait to get permission to continue.

I was flying from Boston MA to Atlanta Georgia via Newark with the flight scheduled 7:30 am with destination arrival 1:18 pm. The flight from the Boston was delayed for more than 5 hours due to thunder storm at Newark and the problem with generator failure at the gate which caused missing of connecting flight to Atlanta. After waiting in queue for 2 hrs at Newark, the boarding pass was issued for 5:40 pm that day(August 11th, Saturday). After the boarding was announced for 5:40 and the gate was opened for crew members, the plane was cancelled. There was already very long queue at consumer service there were no other options than standing in the queue because I was unable to reach customer service via phone. After waiting for line for more than four hours, the situation became very worse due to rude behavior of the customer service representative. She mentioned that next available flight is on Monday morning(August 13th) and there is nothing she can do to help. She also mentioned that hotel accommodation cannot be done as it is weather related although the flight delay from Boston was due to power failure at the gate as well. She convinced me to fly back to Boston next morning(Sunday) and forget about the family vacation or wait at airport until Monday morning. The representative walked away stating that she has other customer to take care of and asking me to make decision to wait until Monday or fly back to Boston on Sunday. It was already past 10 PM and my younger daughter(5yrs) was sleeping on my shoulder. The customer service representative did not came back to the window for more that half and hour and I walked to the next window and requested to talk to the manager. The guy at other window called their team leader who offered option for stand by tickets for next day and spend the night at the airport. I was already tired and hungry and there was no other option than crying or comforting wife and two kids. Spent cold night at cold airport floor. I was not able to get accommodated on 9 am flight on Sunday. I convinced my wife and two kids who where crying after loosing hope of getting flight. Next available flight for stand by was on 11:01 am. There was already about 60 people on standby list and I was flying in a family of four, so the hope of getting boarding pass was very minimum.

However, at 3:42 AM on morning of departure from BGI (Saturday 1/19), I received an email and text that the BOS-SYR leg of my return trip had been delayed 2 whole dats.

The seating was roomy and was in the front row window seat as it is easier to get in and out around the passenger beside me. The IFE has much larger screens and more selections than the other AC narrow body planes. I really appreciated that. The attendant serving us in the front cabin was attentive with the wine and beverage service. As I fly AC a lot I noticed that dinner service had fewer choices and it was not served as courses nor were there 2 linens on the tray. Given this was a flight to a beach destination and I bought the return ticket at a very reasonable price, I can understand you would not get the same level of meal services I experience when traveling to Toronto, Montreal or Europe. One disappointment is the size of the forward rest room...thankfully I am a tall slim person. It would feel very cramped for some others. Also missing was the hand and face lotion that one typically finds in business class. This I missed as the air is so dry. I would appreciate it if AC would add that to the business class rest rooms on the 737Max. Check in was smooth and well organized. There is no lounge at PVR for front cabin passengers.

Original SEA-LAX flight was canceled due to mechanical on inbound aircraft. I received a text message with this update and before I could even get to the agent UA had me rebooked on another carrier getting in just 30 minutes after my original UA routing. When I got up to the agent she had my ticket ready and waiting for me. I fly United almost every week and seldom have cancellations or major delays.

We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets.

The fasten seatbelt sign came on many times during the flight with the recorded announcement, ""please fasten your seatbelt."" I was really happy that they did not make announcements in a second or third language which can make sleeping with United very difficult.

United Airlines,1.0,K Castle,3rd March 2014,Traveled to Denver from Rochester NY on United twice in the past month. Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane. Now I have to contact Customer Service as no one in the Service Center in the Denver Airport is authorized to do so. I am dreading the return flight home.

Being a regular flyer especially on routes where I have little or no choice of carrier, I feel that this airline avoids the use of terminal walkways - for reasons that anybody can guess - and chooses the use of good old tiring busses as if we are in the 50s. This I have experienced on many flights on Aegean from Larnaca, Munich, Madrid to name but a few. This was again the case for my recent flight both ways to and from Warsaw. Good old bus at Athens airport and then into a semi-dark ground floor in an airport which has no moving walkways for pedestrians and you have to walk from one end to the other.

First of all, I can almost assure you 95% of the employees there get paid to not care about their jobs. When I arrived 25 mins before boarding time, I had to get a different flight. Employee neglected to let me know there were standby flights available. When I was leaving Nashville, I was 33 minutes before boarding time and was still considered ""late"", this lady only let me know the standby option. Clearly the employees are clueless about their jobs and have no sympathy whatsoever. I've never sat in such a tiny seat, I felt absolutely trapped and terrible on only an hour and a half plane ride. When I got on standby the guy at the podium let me know I was the second name to be called. After several names being called, I was the last one along with two other men. They made me walk all the way to the airplane door just to let me know they had miscounted the seats and were fine with sending me away. As I waited for the next standby flight, the lady took forever and continued to do other things while I was sitting right in front of her. Then said the next standby was at another gate, to get in line for 10 mins and wait for them to announce a gate change. I went to the different gate that they announced just for the employees to look at me because they werent ready for that flight yet. The neglect and ignorance of this company is unreal.

After waiting in line for about 25 minutes, I was told that I had to go back and print my baggage tag also. The person at the counter flatly refused to print it for me. My suitcase was small enough to bring on the plane but lost a small bottle of liquor at the security because it was over the size limit. Secondly on the return flight from Fredericton, I was told the flights that that day had been oversold and I may not get a flight. I had bought this ticket beginning of June but was told that because it was an economy ticket, there was not much he could do. After getting really upset, he managed to get me a seat on my booked flight. Staff in Toronto and Fredericton were rude and unwilling to help.

My first flight was delayed by over an hour due to another plane making an emergency landing on my flights runway, and they wrote it down as 'weather delay' because they knew if they did I would not get compensation for a hotel when I inevitably missed my connecting flight. They also constantly demand you check your carry on because they don't allocate enough space for them on flight.

United Airlines,1.0,Sheila Gardiner,23rd January 2019,Not Verified | I flew with United Airlines Dec 26 from Toronto to Houston. We encountered weather problems or turbulence by Houston Airport or that was what I assumed. We circled the airport in the fog for 40 minutes with no communication from pilot or staff the entire time to let us know what was going on. Was an unnerving experience. On Jan 16 I again flew with United Airlines from Auckland to San Francisco. Again no communication from pilot or staff regarding the reason for the excessive turbulence. The stewardesses seemed to be very irritable and also the washrooms very dirty. The only thing said by the pilot was thanks for flying United after we landed.

Air Canada,2.0,J Cowles,23rd July 2015,"Came off a flight from London and had booked an internal flight to get me to Edmonton. Turns out it would have been quicker to drive. We boarded on time but were then told that there was an electrical fault with one of the radios. We waited on the tarmac for an hour and then an engineer came and replaced the offending part. During this time, communication from the flight attendant was scant and when he did speak it was comical. Each time he read the announcements from his dog-eared handbook looking like he would rather be anywhere else in the world from here. We eventually took off and the flight to Edmonton was fine. On landing we were in the middle of a thunderstorm so there was no tractor available to tow us to the gate. We waited around 30 mins and then we were good to go. Coming back it was another story. I was booked on the 3pm flight back to Calgary to connect to AC850 at 17.50. I checked in and was happily waiting at the gate when my cousin called to tell me we were delayed (she was getting updates from an app on her phone). There was nothing to say we were delayed on any of the airport screens. Further updates came through to say the delay was being extended and then it finally came up at the gate, although no announcements were made. I had to watch the 4pm and 5pm flights depart on time and then finally the 3pm flight was cancelled and we were transferred to the 6pm flight. Obviously I had missed my connection by that point. Cabin staff on the return leg were rude and unhelpful when I tried to enquire how best to get to my next gate at Calgary. I understand that airlines are always prone to delays but the lack of communication really annoyed me. I'll definitely try to get a direct flight next time.

Alitalia,1.0,Stephen Brookes,21st February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Alitalia is a joke airline. My flight was delayed by 6 hours due to a fault in one of the engines. In London the ground crew did eventually try to find passage on other carriers, however some of the passengers were told that the plane had been fixed just as we got to the ticket counter of Lufthansa, so we had to go back through security which was a bit of a pain. There was no inflight entertainment and the inflight meals were very poor. The staff on the flight also seemed a bit stressy. We had delays at Rome also. I tried to get a change of carrier for the return trip from my agent, but the cost of doing so would have been excessive. The return flight was similarly poor although there were no delays. However when I arrived at Heathrow I found that they had managed to break my suitcase lock. When I went to the service desk they gave me a form and a claim number. I was tod to submit the form by email to their customer relations department. I sent my claim form as requested, however I was told that I had to download another form, fill it in, sign it and send a scan of this form and of my passport. I did this, but in error sent the unfilled form back instead of the signed scan. Any reasonable customer care department would realise that this was an error. I was told that I am no longer eligible for the compensation for my bag even though I subsequently sent the correct file.

Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss.

That would present little issue except that we are arriving in to San Juan on a cruise ship at 8:00 am. and could not make the flight. The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport. I called Customer Service and they could not have made it easier for me and were more than willing to accommodate our request.

We finally got to LAX and had to wait to get off the plane because a group of Chinese tourists needed to get to the International terminal.

When we finally got to the main counter we were told that the only plane we could get was at 11.35pm that night - it was only 9am. We tried to negotiate to get another airline or even a hotel and catch the direct plane the next morning but we were told if we wanted to do any of that it would be at our own cost.

Emirates,8.0,Jo Smith,5th May 2014,Birmingham-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney-Christchurch NZ 19 January 2014. Economy. Nice food and good service. Birmingham - Dubai was a 777 (2 class) and we had bassinet bulkhead seats row 8 which gave lots of legroom. Dubai - Bangkok was the A380 which is super comfortable we had bulkhead behind seats next to the midships galley. There was some noise from the galley and there is a locker above the seats which is not great but we were comfortable enough. Bangkok - Sydney was with Qantas this was the least comfortable as plane was older. Although Emirates is Qantas partner you cannot pre-assign seats for Qantas flights so these were our least good seats. Sydney to Christchurch was again a 777 and not full so I again sat in row 8. I believe that Emirates does not make the (777 2 class) row 8 bassinet seats available until airport check in.

Emirates,2.0,Florian Roth,14th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who donÂ´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.",A380 / Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Hyderabad via Duabi,December 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,no

Emirates,1.0,S Varden,15th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism, by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline, but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time, but departure time came & went, & passengers were left sitting, with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin, but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again, we sat with no update k for over another hour, by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated, but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However, for a 3rd time, passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small 2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times. After flying for 25 years, I have never experienced a more incompetent flight operation.

The business class lounge in Dubai is akin to warehousing premium passengers - a cavernous space with no redeeming features. There was nothing good about this experience. And a queue of 10 for the rest room in a supposed premium lounge area? Really? This is not a premium experience, period. Thankfully I only to have to endure EK on a bi-annual basis.

There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. After take-off, the cabin crew started the snack/drink service. Everyone got a cheese/beacon sandwich, but I am a vegetarian so I asked them if they had a vegetarian sandwich. They had vegetarian sandwiches and I got 2 drinks with the sandwich. From Athens, I took my next plane towards Amsterdam. This flight was operated by Aegean itself and the plane was an A321. There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. 30 minutes after take-off, the cabin crew started to serve meal and drinks to everyone onboard. Sadly, they didn't had a vegetarian option. But beside the meal itself everything was tasty. After I finished the meal I have slept till our descent towards Amsterdam. We arrived safely at Amsterdam.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,W Marks,5th August 2011,I have flown over 100 flights on Southwest and have not had a bad flight. Back in the old days when the first in line got to board first we always arrived early to get the best seats. Now that Southwest issues boarding numbers we always pay the extra $10 to get priority boarding. The system of having no assigned seats is much more efficient and gets the plane off the ground much faster. Like many others I am disappointed that the Rapid Rewards Program has changed. It was a very generous program now it is similar to most of their competitors.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

The ground service was much better than Tel Aviv, but I still did not like the security check at Moscow airport because it takes a lot of time. Families who travel with children and elderly people or people with disabilities are eligible to board the plane first, so it was a pleasant experience we did not experience in Tel Aviv. On the flight from Moscow to Tel Aviv they also registered our names before boarding the plane to see if they all arrived (which did not happen in Tel Aviv and that's why we delayed another hour in Tel Aviv!). The chair was the most comfortable but the entertainment system worked properly this time, but the food was not surprising, and it was not very tasty (especially the meat).

American Airlines,1.0,S Mark,6th July 2014,Paris to Boston on an old and uncomfortable 757. The worst international business class seat I've ever had.

Qatar Airways,7.0,G Jones,9th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Colombo via Doha. Qatar Airways flies from London Heathrow Terminal 4. Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for Â£590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss.

Emirates,5.0,M Milton,31st January 2014,Flew LHR-DXB return in January of this year. Seat on A380 spacious and comfortable ICE system great toilets clean flights largely on time. Only problem is the dreadful cabin crew. So disorganised and slow when serving meals. Took 2 hours on the LHR-DXB flight to be offered a drink. In the end I went up to the galley area where the crew were just chatting and asked for water. Meal was served 3 hours into a 6 hour night flight so no one got any sleep. Not a single drinks run after that. Service truly appalling compared to airlines like Singapore airlines. Also no comfort kit was provided - socks toothbrush etc which I suppose is a minor thing. Return flight was better as there was one drinks run. Still not great though. Wouldn't choose to fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,3.0,T Eldem,30th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FAâ€™s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FAâ€™s do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations.

During the flight they were very attentive and when called there were no grumpy faces! In terms of entertainment, I don't think any airline can beat Emirates' ICE entertainment system. It's fantastic and you'd never get bored with their selection of movies offered on their enormous screens (bigger than your standard iPad!). Loved their on board cameras too. Seats and legroom on the A380 are great - by far better than their cramped 777s! The plane was also only half full so I had 2 spare seats next to me. The food was good although I wasn't very hungry and didn't finish it all but needless to say there was plenty, not to mention the extra snacks offered on board. Emirates also give you real cutlery not plastic ones. Only downside is that toilets got quite dirty and weren't taken care of by the crew (but this of course is also down to careless passengers) and WIFI didn't work properly though with all of the above, you forgot it was even there.

We had a good experience on the way to Paris and at Doha airport, flying with our young children. Our return flight was a morning flight at 8:55am from CDG airport. We had checked in online the night before. Due to a series of issues at CDG airport we arrived at the check-in counter at 8:10am, late for check-in, which closes 60 minutes before the flight. I immediately attended the Qatar Airways desk, where I explained the situation to an employee. The only response I obtained was â€œyou cannot get on the flight, we will put you on the next flightâ€. There was no attempt on behalf of the employee to problem-solve or to offer us solutions to get on our flight. At my insistence, she contacted the gate staff and again stated we would not be able to board the flight. At no stage did the employee suggest that part of our travelling party could board the flight with hand luggage only as we had already checked in online. This would have been a helpful suggestion allowing us time to reorganise our luggage and take essential items. However, the employee did not have a friendly or helpful approach, seeming to just want to put us on the next flight which was 14 hours later and would cost 2200 euros in fees. This was not an option for our family. I asked if my wife and the children could board with hand luggage only. The employee replied that it was too late. I insisted that she call the gate to see if this was a possibility. She called the gate and then told us again that it was too late, that the gate closes 20 minutes prior to departure and it was now 8:30, 25 minutes prior to departure. The employee stated that it would not be possible for us to reach the gate in five minutes- again no help was offered and her attitude was bad. At this point, we discounted her advice and ran to the gate as fast as possible with our two young children. This was a difficult experience for them and they were crying. If the employee had informed us of this option even 10 minutes earlier, we would not have had to rush as much as we did. Luckily the CDG airport staff were very helpful and my wife and children were able to get on the flight with our hand luggage. I returned to the Qatar Airways desk to re-book another flight in the evening. When I checked-in in the evening, I had to deal with poor customer service again. I have contacted Qatar Airways customer service on several occasions in the past month but their responses have basically been â€˜we are very sorry about thisâ€™ but they refuse to offer any compensation or explanation.

I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the ""Premium Access"" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus. I had a scheduled stop over of six hours but United decided to double it to 12 as the plane taking me to Wausau was delayed due to weather which I will say not entirely United's fault but some food and drink tokens would not of gone un-noticed.

Air New Zealand,2.0,J Morrison,5th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | After looking forward to flying with Air New Zealand from Auckland to Hong Kong we were extremely disappointed with their poor customer service. We upgraded to a Skycouch as my wife has arthritis and we paid an additional Â£300 for this. On boarding we discovered they had made an error and not booked us the Skycouch. We were promised a refund. Almost 2 months later they still owe us Â£300 and have failed to respond to any emails, or return phone calls when promised they will arrange someone to phone us back. Their lack of customer care is appalling. We were not the only ones they made a booking error with and we were told by inflight staff that the service centre are always making errors. They clearly do not take care with their service and can't be bothered dealing with their customers. Even before we flew they failed to answer emails. At the airport didn't offer any help to my disabled wife, just passing us between one person and another who couldn't just advise us where to go for the necessary wheelchair.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Hong Kong,March 2017,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,no

I cannot think of one reason to keep any credit card that only allows redemption on American as well. Customer service is becoming almost fight as they are not willing to negotiate or explain or accommodate customers anymore. I paid 178.00 cash to buy three thousand aadvantage miles for a $200 ticket, due to all the fees, they even rewarded me 5,000 miles for my purchase. Every single customer service rep I spoke with told me I should read all their fine print online to add up the fees prior to booking. I could not cancel even within the first 5 minutes. They are aggressive and used tactics trying to make me feel I was inadequate in my booking purchase. Yikes.

They served food for the short 2h flight and it was delicious. Of course, a negative point of first class was the IFE being in the armrest which was inconvenient.

American Airlines,8.0,Williams Mark,20th June 2014,LHR-MIA 11 June 777-300ER in Main Cabin Extra. I read a lot of complaints about American but it is an American airline serving American tastes. It has no desire to compete with the significantly better Asian and Mid East airlines and it would seem quite happy with its 3-star rating. So don't expect too much! Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight. The service was prompt and efficient the food acceptable and staff were present throughout the flight. Take off and landing were about on time.

United Airlines,1.0,M Dennis,22nd July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I have flown United Airlines several times, and they have shown incredible consistency in being the absolutely worst airline. My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5' 10"" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city. I would happily pay double to avoid getting on a United flight.",A319,Business,Economy Class,LGA to ORD,November 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,4.0,Farouk Mogheth,23rd December 2013,Not entirely certain why Air Canada calls itself a legacy carrier. Flew New York Newark to Vancouver and then later on to Los Angeles. Payment for checked in luggage on an international flight is unacceptable. Offering no food (only for purchase) for a 6+ flight is unacceptable. Ground male staff in Vancouver (flight to LAX) was extremely rude and arrogant to most passengers including an elderly gentleman who was confused about payment for luggage. Planes are spotless and its a complete shame since the onboard crew were simply perfect with their service as well as attention to security (far superior to any US airline I used in the last 3 weeks on my USA/Canada tour).

Air Canada,3.0,M LaPrairie,28th October 2013,AC002 NRT-YYZ. Dated cabin. Rushed service. Indifferent attitude. What can I say? Who needs flight attendants in J class telling you that you cannot have your meal a bit later after the regular service? A crew member in my aisle said no dinner is now. After I politely said that I'd rather eat a bit later (13 hour flight) she replied ok you can wait but it might be cold. She then proceeds to unfold my tray when I am away from my seat. Unfortunately she didn't put my tray completely flat being in such a big rush to keep to her schedule and not wanting to disturb her routineâ€so on the first use of my knife my entire tray goes flying sending food into the guy across the aisle from me. There I am on the floor picking up bits of food and apologizing to my neighbor. Not good. Honestly when you book a couple days before departure and your ticket (one way) costs US$6200 you can eat when you want. Old outdated audio/visual. Main meal looked like the dogs breakfast.

American Airlines,2.0,P Walker,23rd May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | First I'd like to start out saying that 20 years ago, I had the exact same result as I did this past weekend and swore I would never fly American Airlines again. I was returning to Houston from Salt Lake City, I had to go thru Dallas for a connecting flight. My flight in Salt Lake City was delayed due to weather issues originally. I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, once I heard of the delay and got up in line (a long one at that) to be told to call the 1-800 number to get done faster. When I spoke with customer service, they told me ""I'll be fine as the plane is supposed to board at 4.08 pm"" and I was like ""Oh great, ok, I don't need anything else then"". Not realizing the time when I hung up the phone, it was 4.12 pm and there was no plane at the gate. So, we (as in other passengers and myself) were getting updates saying we were boarding every 10 minutes. Come to find out, because of the weather, the plane that was trying to land was re-routed to Pocatello, ID because they needed to re-fuel. The plane finally landed around 6.15 pm, only to learn that our flight was now cancelled due to the fact that the flight crew had met their hours for the day and couldn't fly anymore. So, at that point we were all stranded, most other flights were full and I for sure was going to miss my connecting flight. Supposedly, because this was a weather issue, American Airlines would not put any of the passengers up in hotels, etc. However, it was no longer a weather issue as other planes were flying in and taking off just fine in Salt Lake City. This was clearly, American Airlines crew that couldn't fly anymore. So our flight was delayed until 7.00 am the next morning. So we return to the airport, did not receive any updates on our flight and hoping for the best I spoke with the gentleman at the gate and asked him to help me find a connecting flight to Houston. He told me, they were all full and to try once I get to Dallas to get on stand by. I finally make it to Dallas, I get off the plane and go directly to the ticket counter at the gate that I just walked out of. I explained that I needed a connecting flight to Houston. At first, the lady couldn't find me in the system (even though I just walked off the plane) and then once she did find me in the system, she said she had record of me landing the night before in Dallas. At this point, I was boiling mad, because clearly she just saw me walk off the plane. Then she said, there was a flight later in the evening that she could get me on. I explained it was my daughter's graduation party that evening and I needed to be home before 8.00 pm that night. So, she handed me a boarding pass and told me to go try and get on Stand by on another flight. Went to that gate only to find out there was a lot of other people standing by and probably would not make that flight and at that point I went and got a rental car so I can be home in time for my daughter's graduation party, that I was hosting. My biggest disappoint in the airline is that not one American Airlines employee even said ""I'm sorry!"" When you work in customer service and have an upset customer, you should always acknowledge that you understand the frustration and you are working hard to get us home or to resolve the issue. This never happened with American Airlines. I was met with one rude person after the other. It wasn't just me.

I am aware that Star Alliance do not have a lounge there but all other airlines I have used before have given me access to contracted lounges. TK did not. First flight as relatively OK on their new B737 but seats were very uncomfortable. Then we arrived in IST and the problems started. When I went to the lounge and connected my phone to the wifi I found an email from them saying ""your flight to {1} is delayed please contact {2}"". I went to the lounge reception and showed them the email and they told me it's nothing to worry about. When I looked on their website though I saw that the IST-CMB flight was delayed by 5 hours. From then it took us about 3 hours in order to sort out a hotel. When the flight departed the next morning there was no mention at all by anyone as to why the flight was delayed or a single apology. 10 hours on that plane and nothing.

My wife and I have traveled extensively in first and business class and decided to fly to the USA from Perth via Auckland with Air New Zealand. Normally we would travel through Singapore, but since we had not been to NZ before, we decided to route via Auckland. The herring bone seating arrangement made it very difficult to look out the window and so you spend a lot of time looking inward at fellow passengers, who are looking at you. However, once the bed was down and you were sleeping, this was no longer a problem. But, this is when another disadvantage of this close racked seating became more apparent, the unpleasant smells vented by nearby passengers had you reaching for the air ventilation nozzle, unfortunately this does not exist on the 787. The food was probably down with the worst we have experienced, but the cabin staff did their best to offset this by plying passengers with booze, it seemed their mantra was a drunk passenger was a happy passenger.

The staff there is the worst. I would give the rating negative 1. They just took their time to figure out your next flight.

Virgin America,1.0,Jeffrey Liehr,20th December 2016,"The flight San Francisco to Los Angeles was delayed while we waited for crew to turn up for work for nearly an hour. This cost me my connecting flight. They accepted no responsibility as my connecting flight was not booked through Virgin America, but Virgin Australia. I then had to pay for another ticket to continue my journey back to Australia. The staff member was smug and and would offer no assistance to my predicament. When I arrived at LAX, Virgin America had then lost my luggage. After waiting around I finally hurried a lost luggage report that took so long I was in jeopardy of missing my newly booked flight. I had to argue with the attendant as he would not accept the fact that my phone number was an overseas number. He was adamant that I needed to provide an American phone number(?), which of course I could not provide, as I live in Australia. We agreed on my email address. After arriving back in Australia I did receive an email saying that they had found my luggage and it was ready to be picked up.I replied that this was impossible and how was I to get the luggage and would it be couriered to my house. Their reply was that it was ""a courtesy"" that they would place it on a plane back to Australia, giving me a ticket and flight number.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to LAX,December 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

Why didn't they announce it for all of section 9 until right before the flight was boarding, when I would have had time to go back to the baggage claim and only have to pay 25 dollars instead of 50 now for a carry on size.

Customer service was terrible, no help was given, and no solution so I am now flying Delta. I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful. The horrid stories of this airline disregarding customers needs or even attempting to be helpful have never been more evident than today and I am overjoyed with the care and kindness shown by Delta airlines.

American Airlines,1.0,Laurel Bailey,11th January 2015,American Airlines seriously needs to reconsider its business plan of overbooking every single flight on one day and how that affects passengers trying to make connections when one flight is late. They also need to train their employees to treat passengers with respect and provide more telephone customer service options that don't leave you waiting 45-51 minutes. My flight was 90 minutes late out of Miami and I therefore missed my connection to San Francisco and apparently every other flight was overbooked for the next 24 hours which is completely insane.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Good breakfast however a family member of mine was informed that they had run out of the breakfast meal she wanted. This was quite disappointing as there were only 6 people in business class and Qatar cannot be known for great food if they run short of them.

Seats were very comfortable although I prefer the ones on the B777 to those on B787 as they seem to offer more space. The seat in the flat-bed position is very comfortable thanks to the additional padding used when the seat is converted into the bed. Food and wine selection were great on both legs and the presentation was top notch. Bathrooms were kept clean throughout both flights. IFE had a wide range of movies and music to satisfy all tastes.

However, people with large feet could find it difficult to squeeze them into the rather small cutout in the back of the seat in front. The inflight entertainment system was very good and the movies on offer were entertaining. There were three mains to choose from for dinner. Food quality was very good. They served a breakfast before landing. The flight attendant in our aisle was friendly and professional, but we felt she did not want to go into conversations any further than her service duties required.

Jetblue Airways,3.0,Gabriela Fletcher,20th October 2018,"Not Verified | Salt Lake City to Raleigh-Durham via New York. I flew on standby on my most recent trip with Jetblue. I've flown standby many times and I am used to not always getting on the first time I go to the airport but this time was ridiculous. I attempted to leave on a Tuesday evening and at the very last second before the flight was closing its doors, I was told it was my lucky day and I got one of the last seats on the plane because someone didn't show up. I was printed a new ticket with my name and seat assignment, checked my carry on (since they ran out of overhead bin space), found my seat and buckled up. I sat there patiently waiting for take off when a stewardess/flight attendant came and told me the other person showed up and needed their seat back! They escorted me off the plane, gave me my bag back, and sent me on my way. They should not have been able to take me off the plane and give my seat away once they established the previous customer did not get the seat anymore and printed a new ticket with my name and that seat assignment. After three days of waiting on standby and being rolled over, I finally got a seat on a plane to JFK where I was supposed to connect to RDU and finally get home. When I arrived to JFK I found out the attendants that were rolling over my flight the previous days did not roll over my connecting flight each time like they should have (or at least they should have notified me I needed to talk to the proper people to get them rolled over) so I had to run all over the airport looking for someone who could help me get on the next flight out. Every person I dealt with that worked for Jetblue was rude to me, cut me off mid-sentence thinking they knew what i was asking before I could finish, or acted like I was at fault for not doing what I was supposed to (even though I was never notified of an issue and if I ever asked questions i was immediately cut off or rushed away so I didn't have to be dealt with). Jetblue treats their customers like second class citizens, even when they pay the full priced more expensive tickets like I have on previous occasions. On top of all this, I've also had luggage damaged when flying with them that they refused to take responsibility for. They have nice planes but the disappointing customer service and problems they have caused me when trying to travel have definitely turned me off of ever flying with them again!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Raleigh-Durham via New York,October 2018,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,9.0,M Ferris,2nd November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I took American Airlines AA109 flight LHR-LAX (Economy) just over a month ago. And let me tell you, it was nice: you left the plane with a great feeling rather than a standard one! While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isnâ€™t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average Iâ€™d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as theyâ€™d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didnâ€™t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didnâ€™t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think itâ€™s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didnâ€™t help so much after all, but thatâ€™s ok. As you can see, American Airlines is not as bad as lots of people say.

American Airlines,2.0,T Meales,24th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Nashville via Charlotte. First and foremost when I booked my flight, I booked it so I would leave out of my home city Sarasota/Bradenton. I was to leave at 5:00 on a Friday morning. At 10:30 p.m. on Thursday I get a text that my flight has been cancelled. Of course I immediately call AA and am told it will take one and half to two hours before I even get a return call. I wait for about an hour and try again. Rather than giving me the call back option this time, they recognize my number and ask me to hold. I do so for about 45 minutes. Eventually I get a customer service representative and my only option is to fly out of Tampa airport the next morning. They initially had me rebooked on a 10:30 a.m. Flight from Tampa but by the time I got into Nashville and then drove two hours to where my daughter lives, all of Friday would have been wasted. So I rebooked on a 5:00 a.m. Flight, getting into Nashville at the same time I would have if my Sarasota flight hadn't been cancelled. By this time it's 1:00 or so in the morning. That leaves me about an hour's worth of sleeping time before I have to get up and leave for the Tampa airport. While I made the flight on time and the customer service representative was very helpful in getting me on that flight, the fact remains I had to drive an hour to the airport and park my car whereas if I had left from Sarasota like I normally do, I would have used Uber and not incurred $90 in parking fees (plus two hours of driving time and tolls). American Airlines refuses to reimburse me. If I had missed my flight you can be sure I wouldn't have gotten a refund or any other courtesy. All I want is a refund of the parking fees.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,D Buijs,29th December 2014,AMS-PTY and return. I flew with KLM for the first time. The reason was the price and the flight schedule. Departure was late because of the fog. The captain informed us well and during the flight they gave information about the connection flights in PTY. Onboard the seat felt very narrow. It was onboard of a 777-300ER. Not much choice on the IFE but for me it was enough. The crew was very attentive and friendly. The food was good especially the icecream the served half way the flight. On the return I flew with a 777-200. It was on old plane but the seats were more spacious. The screen for the IFE was bad smaal and you couldn't see much on te screen in some positions. The crew was friendly again and there was good food. What I also liked is that the crew offering you plenty of drinks and after dinner they offer you liquor. Nice touch I didn't saw it on other airlines I flew with. We departed and arrived on time. So overall a good experience. I would definitely choose KLM again if the price is right. It's not very special but it's good and they have a nice crew. The only thing is that they have to renew their fleet. The 777-200 feels quite outdated.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Rochelle Leblanc,1st September 2015,"I am so disappointed in American Airlines and their customer service. On August 26th I left from Vancouver to head to LAX. I was supposed to have a 51 minute layover before I jumped on my next flight to Denver. This was not going to be a problem, I was assured by many staff members that our arrival gate was right next to my departure gate, I did not have any luggage only a carry on, and did not need to go through security, just simply get on the flight. As I boarded my plane, we were told that we would have to sit there for another 45 minutes because LAX was under construction and was not ready for us to arrive at our estimated time. This made my connection now only 25 minutes before departure of my Denver flight, but again I was reassured by staff that this would not be an issue. Upon arrival at 9pm (25 minutes before departure of next flight) the pilot informed us that even though they were aware there were many who needed to run to their connecting flight, we were unable to get off. By the time we got off the plane and ran next door to our gate, American Airlines flight to Denver had already closed the door. I ran to the staff member right away as I was only a minute or two behind the designated ""door closing"" time and was rudely dismissed and told there was nothing that could be done. After waiting 20 minutes, a member came and helped me reschedule my flight for the next morning at 6.30am. Seeing as it was 9.30 pm, I would need accommodation for the night. American Airlines offered zero help with accommodation. In result, seeing as my flight was very early in the morning and I needed to be there the night before, I had to stay at a hotel close by.

Air Canada,1.0,S Jensen,17th May 2014,"Toronto-DC-Toronto in mid-May and paid the $25 per bag fee for checked baggage. Too many ""economy-minded"" passengers didn't want to pay this reasonable fee so opted to bring over-stuffed bags onto the flight as ""carry-on""s. One woman with such a bag PLUS a large backpack so large it could not fit under the seat. These people were not directed by AC staff to check their bags the consequence being that there was insufficient in-cabin overhead bin space causing a delay in boarding of over 20 minutes. This caused us to queue on the runway for over half an hour waiting for clearance from air traffic control. The result - we left DC around the time we were supposed to land in Toronto. Contacted AC regarding this irritation and received an email that the wait-time for a response is twenty working days (yes that's a month!)

Southwest Airlines,1.0,P Dawson,25th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This is the first and last time I fly Southwest. I'm very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. I flew in from Dallas Lovefield to Phoenix Arizona for a business meeting. On my way out of Dallas I found no line. But I did find two female Southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. They were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in, as well as print my boarding pass for me. When it came time to board I was in the B group. That was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. Great since I'm 28-going on 29 weeks pregnant and I may need to get up to use the rest room. I've only flown American and Delta with assigned seats. I hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. I had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. Once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to San Diego I believe. No big deal until the plan begins to get refueled! The fumes were so strong and awful. Fast forward a day, I'm pleased to go home to Dallas, hoping for better luck with my seat this time. Unfortunately my pass says I'm in group C. Even further out from boarding than on my flight in. At our boarding time of 5.15pm we were told that the flight crew for our flight will not even land until 5.45pm, that we may begin boarding at 6.10pm to leave at 6.30pm. This is all a maybe.

Lufthansa,7.0,Richard Connett,20th March 2015,"LH903 - LHR/FRA - A320 - 27 Jan. The check-in service at LHR was exceptional and one of the best check-in experiences I have had. As I was a premium customer the agent gave me an exit row seat and kept the next seat to me vacant. The service changed for the worst in the departure lounge. First of all they announced boarding for business class and Star Alliance Gold customers. I skipped over to that line to board only to be hauled up by an abrupt and loud ground crew member to be told in front of everyone that ""we are only boarding business class and Gold Star Alliance customers"". I had pleasure in telling her I was a Star Alliance Gold Member (actually Elite with Air New Zealand) and I then boarded. In this day and age no one should ever presume that only people wearing Savile Row suits and Italian shoes are the Premium customers.

United Airlines,1.0,P Pomeranze,13th October 2014,Oct 7 SF to Kona First Class. At the prices they charge even in this age of low expectations I was shocked at the experience of this trip. To begin with the aircraft used a 737 is just inappropriate for a five hour trip. The legroom was ridiculous for any class of service but unbelievable for a premium ticket. When the gentleman in front of me reclined his seat I had absolutely no space left. In coach one has come to expect this but not at these prices. I was one of two people judging from the upgrade list posted who paid full fare and that resulted in a full cabin. The flight attendants tried hard but United gave them nothing to work with. The breakfast served was small and awful there was only non fat milk for coffee and the food was inedible. The flight was timed to leave at 9.44 to avoid serving a more expensive lunch by one minute. The cost cutting is unbelievable the experience absolutely horrific to be avoided at any cost.

When I pressed the call button staff no one came for the entire 8 hours flight (same for Bangladesh to Dubai). I had to get up and get the water myself after 90 minutes of waiting. I paid over $2.500 USD and it was not worth the money. The seats were so close together that the passenger next to me had to place his leg on my side just to fit into his seat.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,10.0,Marc Liljeqvist,22nd December 2014,I flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo with a stop-over en Moscow SVO. It was a very positive experience. Aeroflot has gone through a large modernization programme in the recent years and it was very evident when I travelled with them. Most of their fleet now consists of modern airliners such as the A320 the A330 and the Boeing 777. I flew on their A320 from CPH to SVO. For a short-haul flight the onboard service was extremely good compared to most European airlines. The food consisted of fresh bread cheese beef and a delicious cake and the cabin crew were serving cold and hot drinks throughout the whole flight. The crew was extremely friendly. Since the plane was only half full many of the passengers were lying down across the seats. The cabin crew immediately offered them blankets and pillows to make them more comfortable. This is the first time I have experienced this on a European flight. The transfer at SVO was smooth and easy. The airport has been renovated and now offers an easy access between the terminals without having to go outside the airport. The passport and security check took less than 10 minutes much to my surprise and I was now standing in Terminal D which had a wide selection of restaurants shops as well as free WiFi. The flight to Tokyo was on an A330. The interior felt fresh and new and the seats were very comfortable although for a tall guy such as myself the legroom left much to be desired but that is not the fault of the airline. The cabin crew on this flight were fluent in English and Japanese. Again very friendly people. There was a passenger in front of me who seemed rather anxious about flying and kept calling the crew throughout the whole flight. They never ignored his calls or talked bad to him. They kept smiling and did what they could to make him feel comfortable. The food was again very tasty and the menu offered both Russian and Japanese dishes and despite the rather cramped space I had a very comfortable flight to Tokyo. I have read many negative reviews about Aeroflot and I will not deny that people might have had some bad experiences but my opinion on Aeroflot is that it is a modern airline that offers some of the cheapest tickets in the world while maintaining a high standard in customer service. I have already booked my next flight with Aeroflot and I will continue to fly with them whenever possible.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,8.0,Anthony Gibbons,29th May 2014,Rio to Barcelona via FRA. Had already travelled 17 hours from NZ before taking Lufthansa but crew were warm efficient. Could see I was looking fatigued even on departure and crew got everyone fed and watered soon after 10pm take off. In first row of economy on 744 which meant no one could recline into my face! Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied. LH is a reliable airline offering great service and fair prices.

These planes offer standard economy seating not as comfortable as other planes United flies. Bathrooms are extremely tiny and cramped. As opposed to a wide variety of seatback entertainment on UA's 757s from JFK to California this new 737-900 offer no entertainment options at all a major disappointment on such a long flight.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2.0,V Dakorov,19th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Moscow to Tyumen. The aircraft was changed in less than 24 hrs prior to the departure time.

Gate was changed three times in 2 hours before departure (gate 21, then gate 13, then gate 1). Third change has happened right before boarding started. I choose Aeroflot due to my airport preferences. Itâ€™s located close to my home and job. In the last few years, Aeroflot has done a lot to improve their service quality comparing to disaster service they provided. Whole year of 2016 I flew with Aeroflot, and all Aeroflot flights which I flew with were overbooked. Now, in the fall, many Aeroflot flights are cancelled.

The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. The system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory.

Lufthansa,10.0,C Dawes,16th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Victoria-Vancouver-Frankfurt-Geneva on 24 April 2018, returning 10 May. Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1Â¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options â€“ vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.","Dash 8-Q400, Boeing 747-400, CRJ-700, A319",Business,Economy Class,Victoria to Geneva via Vancouver-Frankfurt,April 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Entertainment system is dated and the choices are OK. I recommend loading up your tablet with Netflix and music.

But it's once you're onboard that you realize your mistake. I paid $1030 for a flight from LA to Reading and back, the same price I would pay for a trip to Europe, which is twice the distance. You'd think for that price you can get a minimum quality, even on economy. Wrong. For a start, you pay $30 for your first check-in luggage, and it grows exponentially! Totally outrageous. What this does, it makes everybody bringing carry-ons, overcharging the cabin with carry-on luggage, making it hard to find space above your seat for your luggage, so you have to put it in a totally different area (what a hassle to get it when you exit the plane!). No food for the whole flight (Yes, AA, I don't call food a couple of pretzels and a soda). If you want food, you have to pay for it. And what kind of food! Then, there is the entertainment: just as it seems to become a trend on the worst airlines, American Airlines forces you to use your own devices to be able to watch their programs. In their penny pinching minds, they automatically assume that everyone has a smart phone, or a tablet, or a computer. If you don't have any device on you, or your device is not compatible with their system (more on that later), you're out of luck. But the incredible part is, they don't even provide any electric plug or USB for you to plug in your devices! So, if all you have to watch movies onboard is your smartphone (which is already pitiful), and you need your phone battery fully charged for when you arrive at your final destination and need to call your friends, taxis, hotels, etc., again, you're out of luck. Now, let's talk about device compatibility with their onboard movie/TV system, which uses Flash Player. I did have a fully updated version of Flash Player on my computer, but their system kept saying it was not updated. After several attempts, since they were offering to download their own updated version of Flash Player, I decided to uninstall my version and replace it with theirs. Guess what? It still would not work. Their system would not recognize its own version of Flash Player on my machine! Unbelievable. I uninstalled and re-installed the app again, tried everything to get it to connect. Nothing worked. I spent the whole trip with no entertainment. Also, the cabin remained pitch black the whole time (you could barely see where you walked) which was very hard on your eyes when people constantly turned on their individual light or their computer screen. When we got to the luggage claim area at the airport, no indication anywhere of which carousel it was. When we finally found it, the previous plane had not even started their download, which made us wait for an extra hour. To top it off, I was carrying fragile items in a separate box. American Airlines made me pay an extra $200 (one way) because it was oversize. But the best part: they didn't put it with the oversize luggage (that are usually handled with a bit more care), they put it with the regular ones. Nothing was broken, but the whole experience really made me furious. The irony in all this is: AA is one of the only airline companies to wear the name: American. Aren't you ashamed, guys? You should be.",,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Los Angeles,October 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no
Aegean Airlines,10.0,Geoffrey Seward,13th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Zurich to Heraklion return. Hats off to Aegean Airlines! My wife and I have been flying to Crete each summer for the last eight years. In the past we have flown with a Swiss charter air line. Which was a pain in the butt, for we had to travel when they did, not when we wanted! This time we went with Aegean Check in at Zurich was just outstanding, AAS did their best to move things along even with a long line, done in less than 20 minutes. This was a late night flight, It left on time, and the in flight service was one of the best that I have experienced in a long time. The only interesting comment I can make about the flight down, was the landing, let's just say it was a copilot landing. The best part of the trip was the return flight. Those of us who have traveled to Heraklion, know that the airport is a pit of pain and agony. I will address this issue, in a separate review,for things have changed. With Aegean they have there own separate check in counter, and a self check in, away from the madding charter craziness. Checkin was completed in 10 minutes! This was just fantastic! Where in the past it took hours! Ther was only a slight delay in takeoff due to weather/air traffic in Zurich, in flight service was outstanding again. After 14 years of long haul air travel for work, I have to give Aegean four stars in respect of outstanding service!",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Heraklion,July 2018,3.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4.0,yes
Aeromexico,2.0,C Scanlan,5th December 2011,SFO-OAX roundtrip via MEX. Outbound the 12.40 am departure time became 4.30 am due to a crew issue. The plane was an older 737. The EmPower jacks at our seats were dead and there was grime on the hard part of the seat. There was no special meal service for business class - everybody got a small ham and cheese sandwich. The front toilet quickly got foul but that didn't stop a steady stream of coach passengers coming up front for it. The FA's were nowhere to be seen. AM has no connections/transfers desks for international arriving passengers at MEX. We instead had to go out to the airport lobby and stand in line for an hour at the ticket counter for a rebooking of our missed connection to OAX. Staff working in the ticketing lobby were rude. On the return flight to SFO it was the same older plane and yes the same type of ham sandwich for dinner. Only highlight of flying AM was that we ended up spending a lot of time at the Salon Premier lounges in T2 which were nice though filled to the gills.,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no

Emirates,1.0,Shin Kue Ryu,19th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Emirates just won my worst airline experience. I was supposed to fly the simple Manila-Dubai-Washington route. But instead, I got Manila-Clark airport transfer via bus to get us on a plane there. We then were asked to wait without a clear departure time. Eventually, we left at 2AM after a 8 hour delay. Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible. More so since no Emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made.

United Airlines,2.0,Vermeire Frank,17th March 2015,We set out from Omaha NE approx. 6am to arrive in Kona HI on Feb. 5th at approx 2.30pm. We had connecting flights in Denver and LAX. We sat on the runway in Omaha for 1.5 hrs with maintenance issues and paperwork past our connecting flight departure time out of Denver. At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona. When we arrived in Oahu they had no record of us saying United did not have us booked to Kona. After waiting for everyone to board they were able to get us on. We arrived in Kona approx. 6.5 hrs after we expected to missing a 1/2 a day of our vacation time any activities we had booked and no luggage! Our luggage arrived about 11pm at night. Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed. We were told our tickets were gone for our originally booked flight. So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United. I wonder what their Preventative Maintenance plan looks like if they have one at all and or if they should reconsider their Union as paperwork should not take that long. Not sure we will ever Fly United again. On the positive side we made it there and back!,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,no

Aeromexico,8.0,R Morgan,27th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York JFK to Mexico City. I have been a long time customer of AeroMexico, and overall, I am happy to recommend AeroMexico. All of their planes lean to new or recently renovated, their fares are competitive, and their service is competent. On this trip I was flying JFK-MEX-ACA. The MEX ACA route is an E190, and basically so short (45 minutes) that it is not worth reviewing. Only comment I have there is that I am not a huge fan of gate-bus-gangway flights that Aeromexico opts for for its E190s, as a result of having more planes than Terminal 2 at CdMx can handle. The flight from JFK was great, with only a few hiccups. Checking in at a Premier Clase desk is usually a speedy affair, though this time they could not give me a connecting boarding pass for the Acapulco leg until I got to the gate - they said that check in was not open for that flight - something that has never happened to me on this route before (with identical itinerary). Boarding was easy enough - though I would advise travellers to find and line up in their zone early - there tends to be a rush, and overhead space is always at a premium owing to the seemingly lax enforcement to carry-on rules. It always seems that the ""personal"" bag is the same size as the carry on. The staff was polite, and the announcements clear (and they did get my connecting boarding pass printed). So now on to the Boeing 787 and Clase Premiere, I love this plane. By far the best I have flown. The configurations differ",,,,,,,,,,,,

There weren't any delays and Alitalia is one of the only airlines that still give free drinks and food on board. However, I am not happy with the check in.

They put us on standby and sent us to the standby desk, where we heard the flight was overbooked! We almost missed our flight. According to a lady of Alitalia, this was not the right procedure and they came with us to the standby office to solve the problem (by skipping the queue). I don't understand the point of the seat reservation when you book your flight, when you are not 100% sure Alitalia respects it.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,Jeremy Chesney,13th April 2014,"JFK to AMS and then AMS to ATH. First the JFK flight: We flew on the lovely new Boeing 777-300ER on this extremely short transatlantic flight from New York to Amsterdam around 6 hours flight time. After boarding it felt very clean and new just as an airplane should be. After sitting down it was obvious the seats were incredibly small about 17.5"" wide. Luckily I had an aisle seat allowing me to stretch out a little. The crew acted calm and professional and wanted to help anyone in any way possible. After takeoff I watched a quick film and then was presented with dinner. Just before they served us hot towels which was a nice touch. In my case I ordered the vegetarian pasta dish served with rolls. The flight attendant serving the food was very engaging and personable and wanted to know nearly anything about our trip. My fellow students who came on the trip were sure to ask him questions to which he responded politely. After dinner I settled down for a small nap and just about four hours later the cabin lights were turned back on in preparation for landing. A hot towel was once again given to us which helped us clean up for arrival. Upon landing the flight attendants gave a very polite goodbye and sent us on our way very quickly. Afterwards I was sure to thank the gracious flight attendant who had been so polite to which he wished me luck and great fun in my final destination. Then the flight from AMS-ATH: This flight was conducted on board a Boeing 737-800. The seats again were very similar in that they were small. I was stuck with a middle seat in this case but slept soundly. A sandwich was served which doesn't happen on flights domestically in the U.S which gave me a sense of that European spirit. After landing in Athens the flight attendants once again wished us goodbye. All in all this is one of my favorite airlines and I have not ever had a better flight attendant than the one on the flight from JFK.

Emirates,8.0,D Irvin,8th July 2015,Flights on time. For dinner the last meal available had something that I was intolerant of. They managed to find me a crew meal that saved the day. What was strange was the timing of the meals. Dinner was served about 5pm departure time. Breakfast was about 5am departure time. My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Perth via Dubai,June 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Alitalia,1.0,Dimitrios Zaxhos,31st July 2014,I flew with my wife from Thessaloniki to Rome and back. Both flights were delayed. Plane could be cleaner. As it is an international flight almost 2 hours the only thing you get is a drink and a small bag of biscuits. The coffee is awful. The staff could be more polite. The worst impression was on the return flight. We had only one suitcase which weighed 25 kg. Staff told us that we had to take 2 kg out because only 23kg was allowed. When we told her that we were 2 people but had only one suitcase much less than allowed (23x2 = 46kg) she insisted that we should take 2 kg out of the suitcase. So we had to open our suitcase at the airport. We will never choose this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no
Aegean Airlines,9.0,Peter Xie,13th October 2015,"An excellent experience. Flew Aegean Airlines from Istanbul to Athens, then from Athens to Paris. The crew was pleasant, with attentive service. It was a relatively short flight of 1.5 hours but they managed to fit in a meal service and a drink service. The food was standard regional economy affair - pre-packed snacks and nothing exciting, and there was a reasonable selection of drinks. The cabin was clean, and relatively new. The seats were much better than what I'd expect in short-haul economy. As a gold member I was able to book a seat in the first six rows, which has much more generous seat pitch despite being in economy. Because of the slimness of the seats, even seats further down the plan had plenty of legroom. The only criticism is disembarkation in Athens. Apparently most ( if not all) Aegean flights park on the tarmac, and you need to get on a bus to get to the terminal. This obviously takes more time than desirable, but a small drawback in otherwise an great airline.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Athens,September 2015,5.0,5.0,2.0,,3.0,4.0,yes

My current trip to Alaska from PHL leaves me without either of my bags because the Delta connecting flight out of MSP was 45 minutes delayed. Why was it delayed? Because they needed to kick 8 people off due to weight. This makes me wonder if they knew where they were flying before we got on. How can this oversight occur?

Emirates,6.0,Ben Stoner,2nd October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dubai to Perth. A new plane, nicely decorated and kitted out. The seats had a decent width and pitch and the IFE and onboard connectivity are always good. Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment. On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule.

Air Canada,3.0,W Johnson,17th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Seoul to Philadelphia via Toronto - this is the route I took with Air Canada, not the route that was ticketed. We were supposed to fly from Seoul (ICN) to Washington IAD via Toronto on a United code share. Our flight from Seoul left late and arrived late, which caused a missed 7:30 connection at Toronto. Our request for 2 vegetarian meals was overlooked on this 13-hour flight. The seats were fine for us because we had a 3-person section and could lift the armrests and lean against each other. The flight would have been pretty uncomfortable next to a stranger for 13 hours because the seats are quite narrow. Also, the flight was about the driest I've ever been on - I left with a very dry mouth. When we spoke with the AC personnel about trying to get back to DC, we were told that there were no flights available to anywhere in the DC area that night, direct or through connections. After AC checked with United about a possible routing that would get us to DC at 2:48 p.m. the next day, it became apparent that the routing was not available either. At this point, we discussed other options and I was told that a 9pm flight to Philadelphia was available. We took it. It was delayed 80 minutes. During this time, I booked a car rental from PHL to drop off in the DC area. By the time we left PHL, it was 1am, and I drove to our house 2 hours away, finally arriving at 3am.

We arrived at the Durango airport 1 hour before our flight and were told the flight was overbooked and we could not board. There were available seats, but they were upgrades so we would have to pay the additional cost. That doesn't make sense to me. United sells more economy tickets than there are economy seats on the plane and then expects me to either pay more money to fly or spend the night, at my expense, in Durango. They should have just given us the seats. My son was on a flight leaving Durango after ours for Denver and because of delays missed his connecting flight for Oklahoma. After waiting in a line where passengers were receiving hotel vouchers, he was told in a very matter of fact tone that he did not qualify for a voucher.

Emirates,2.0,Tara Jones,29th June 2018,"Not Verified | London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane. I am very surprised that huge airlines like Emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. Do they not want to know about problems or have feedback? Obviously not. I heard it was rated best airline but by whom? I have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. Well I review them as bad. It is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight (apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint) You should have the opportunity DURING the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. I paid Â£180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. That was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. The flights were Â£1500+. They told me I could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left - thats if. The airport terminal in Dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. They need longer on the ground before next flight. Myself and my son, the people to my side that I could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. The green sausages looked like plasticine. The white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. It states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. They do not. If I wanted my child to have child meals I had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. It is not available to do this online, but meals like kosher and vegetarian are! Ridiculous. And when we boarded, after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water - it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either. I will not choose to fly Emirates again, over priced and over rated.

Checked in at LAS at a staffed desk, this was quick friendly and efficient. After security, which was quiet at the time of the process, we made our way to the Lounge for a 1+ hour wait. Plenty of drinks and nibbles were available and the food area was clean and tidy. It was too early in the day to use the bar! Boarding was by the standard UA â€˜Groupâ€™ System, and being in the first group as stated the boarding pass this was completely painless. On board welcome drinks were offered prior to departure. Meal orders for lunch were also taken. After departure we noticed that the aircraft appeared to level off a bit early and that turns were being made over the Lake Mead area. This manoeuvre lasted for about 10+minutes which we found to be slightly alarming. My co-traveller mentioned this to one of the FAs who advised that â€˜systemsâ€™ were being checked. No flight deck announcement was ever made on this situation. Once the aircraft started to climb again and it was obvious that the aircraft was on course for IAD we were able to relax more and enjoy the well presented lunch and numerous top ups of wine! In spite of the unusual post departure manoeuvres the flight arrived at the gate in IAD a few minutes early. We checked the gate number for the onward DUB flight which was departing a few gates away on the same concourse. We were able to use the UA lounge at IAD for a short stay, this facility was heaving at the time of our mid evening visit so perhaps not so enjoyable. Boarding for Dublin flight commenced about 20 minutes late due to the aircraft's delay from a previous flight. On board the FA in charge greeted each Business-First passenger, and as on the previous sector drinks were service prior to departure along with orders for dinner. Inflight, dinner and more drinks were served. Having eaten earlier there was actually too much food on offer! We did notice that most fellow travellers had skipped the final cheese and desert courses to try and get some sleep. Around 1.5 hours out of Dublin a breakfast was served. The aircraft arrived 10 minutes early. From the gate it was a fair walk along corridors to the immigration and customs area which was near empty at the time of our visit. To conclude, the service on all sectors was great.

United Airlines,1.0,S Gearen,31st March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Amsterdam via Washington-Dulles. We will never fly United again. Due to a mechanical failure, we were asked to get off our flight from IAD-AMS after an hour on the tarmac. We were then asked to check back at the gate in an hour for a status update, at which point they told us to check back in another two and a half hours, though they were already pulling our bags off the plane. It was obvious the flight was not going to take off, but we were strung along for three hours. When it was finally cancelled, we were asked to walk a half a mile from service desk at D15 to C20. Once there we waited for yet another hour in line. Here is where it got absurdâ€¦At the desk the United Service Rep printed out a hotel and 6 meal vouchers for us. While they are printing, our Rep and the other customer service reps were looking at the vouchers and talking about the fact they just said ""invoice"" on them next to payment method and how that was not normal. The manager comes out and tells them that ""it will be fine and just keep printing them."" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason. The next morning we find out the United has not yet sent the form over or paid Westin for our stay. This is the third United flight I have taken in the last 2 months that has either been overbooked or cancel by mechanical failure. United flights are unreliable and their customer service is appalling. All they do is pass the blame and never resolve the issues they have caused.

Air Canada,1.0,M Coram,29th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Brussels to Toronto via Montreal. Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for. After complaining to the flight director who was charming but useless and mouthing platitudes that she would write it up in her report, I braced myself for the arrival of the pasta dish that no one else wanted and that I was going to be saddled with, unless I wanted to be hungry for the next seven hours. It arrives, the foil is removed and it is dry at the edges. I to eat the bun and lettuce with six small slices of red pepper. The dessert is artificially creamy with peach bits that has some pleasant taste but which hardly provides fulfilling sustainment. An hour before landing we are served a savoury pastry in a cardboard box. Mine is a Chicken Fajita. I look at the writing on the box and it says it is made in the UK with ingredients as silicone dioxide to prevent anti-caking and colour - it also says this Fajita is made with chicken from Brazil. I found out that if you try to use the business class toilets up front, you will be castigated and sent to the ones at the back of the aircraft.

United Airlines,2.0,L Boardman,22nd December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to New York via Houston. What a tired airplane with tired facilities and tired staff. The seats were so close to the isle I had to make sure my arm was inside the seat. Food when it came was great but when asked what my selection was from the menu I was told that I would be put on a waiting list to see if my choices were available I assume after feeding first class first which I have never heard of before. I asked for a bottle of water and was told due to cut backs it was one bottle per person per trip but they could refill it. Breakfast, I was told off by the stewardess who was super stressed during the flight, because I did not eat my corn flakes which she had to tell another passenger she could not have so I could eat them! My god, I paid over $7000 for a seat on this airplane to be told off because I did not eat my corn flakes! The bathrooms were so small I did not even bother to change my clothes not only because I could not move but there was either water or urine on the floor. Maybe I am spoiled as I have flown business with Qatar Airways and Emerites and they are spacious planes with stewards that are not stressed with big bathrooms that are cleaned regularly and a menu that when you ask for something thatâ€™s is on the menu you are not told you will be waitlisted. Selection of movies very old. No new releases. No offer of any magazines or papers nothing.

As a result of snow in IST, hundreds of flights were cancelled, which is understandable. However, there were minimal ground crew available to assist, and frequent misdirection on the part of the crew who were present.

But do not tell your customers they can't bring the standard purse and smaller carry on until they get to the airport and you trick them into paying $25 to check in their bag. I only realized this while in line using their terrible app trying to check in and avoid the line. Extremely poor user experience. This should be made clear to customers and shouldnt even be their new policy because there is plenty of room under a passengers seats and in the overhead bin. This almost caused me to miss my flight, i just made it. Once you leave a bad first impression like that, doesnt matter if your crew is friendly and services you well.

American Airlines,2.0,Frank Ellsworth,24th February 2014,Flight Zurich to JFK. Very old 767 plane - 21 years - showing excessive wear and tear. Dirty torn carpets and seat covers. Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full. Apparently the word about these run down planes has spread and few people choose AA on a route which also has a direct flight from Swiss. AA terminal at JFK is catastrophic.

Boarding was fast. Crew were nice and caring Seat was comfy but not as comfy as it looks. It's a lie flat where they put a ""mattress"" on but still quite hard to lie on but at least you can stretch out. Food was good but not outstanding. Transit in FRA is a mess CCS flights always got remote parking no gate! You have to climb off the plane get into Van take a 15min ride to Arrivals B then walk 30+ mins through Immigration customs on to Departures A. Senator Lounge at A Gates is like a luxury hotel full breakfast buffet smoking lounge showers full bar and great service.

American Airlines,1.0,Gerard Foy,25th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York to Sao Paulo return. This was my first time to fly with American Airlines. I found the cabin crew most unfriendly and totally disinterested in any passengers. Both flights were similar in duration ie. just under 10 hours. Cabin crew appeared to want to get the meal out of the way as soon as it was safe to serve. About one and a half hours into both overnight flights all meals were served and cleared. Cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 hours to resurface one and a half hours before landing to serve a snack. There was no cabin crew interaction with fare paying passengers for the majority of both flights. There was no provision of water to keep passengers hydrated for an exceptionally long flight. There were no young staff as part of the cabin crew. I have been told the more mature cabin crew are very obsessive over staffing the long haul routes. What a shame. Pity they lack customer service. Also, I was witness to a male cabin crew member telling a young mother holding a baby to sit down in a not so very nice tone of voice, until they were finished working. I almost felt like saying something as I felt he was very rude and condescending to this young mother.

I wouldnâ€™t even give them one star if I had a choice. For an international flight, we purchased additional miles for $1300 so that we would have enough miles to fly â€œmain cabin extraâ€. (This is an extra cost over regular coach because you get extra leg room and other benefits). Being claustrophobic, I needed the seats that we originally chose. AA changed the plane that they were going to fly to Australia (a 15.5 hour flight from LA) and took it upon themselves to move us to much worse seats in the regular coach section. My husband is a Platinum flier for life with 3 million miles flown on AA. After speaking to several supervisors at the platinum desk and writing to customer service, AA refused to do anything about it. At the very least, they should have refunded the $1300 that we had to pay to purchase extra miles in order to get the upgraded section! Shame on you American Airlines.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,Jeri Carter,28th April 2019,"Not Verified | What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again.

United Airlines,1.0,R Hall,31st October 2014,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward.

Instead MCE seats were given to non status customers for free at JFK check in. I am extremely loyal and fly 50+ AA, 100 Oneworld flights per year and simply cannot understand the lack of empathy or empowerment of employees in situations like this.

When I was up at the counter asking the attendants a question, instead of looking at me, she was looking at her phone ignoring what I was saying and just nodding her head. I am traveling with a family of 6, and we just got the economy boarding.

When we began boarding our attendant was very rude and asked us why we were taking our personal item when we â€œwerenâ€™t allowed anything on the planeâ€ I proceeded to tell her that we got the â€œokâ€ from the front check-in as well as when we flew from Portland to Houston. Again, she was rude and said we had to pay in order to have our items on the plane and if not that we could just stay here. She was like â€œtell me know are you going or are you staying.â€ I decided to then pay, thinking that it would be the same amount as our checked bags, but no, it was $180 for two personal item bags. $180 + a rude attendant. But of course, we have no choice, who would want to leave their things behind? After paying and waking to board the plane, she proceeded to follow us and tell us to hurry up basically chasing us down the hall.

Alitalia,5.0,C Mariatti,12th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Rome. On the return flight from Los Angeles we traveled in Premium Economy having requested and obtained a flight upgrade. Having had the upgrade we thought we would enjoy all the privileges of this class of flight including the possibility of embarking 2 bags of 23 kg, but at the airport of LAX we learned that this was not included in the upgrade. Now, if the company offers me an upgrade (through participation in an auction) it should also specify which services the customer has access to and which are not. Needless to say, at the airport to our grievances they shrugged and the conclusion was that we were able to take two extra bags as members of the Ulisse Club. Frankly it was so many years that I did not travel Alitalia and in this circumstance I remembered why. Another flaw that I found is the bad grace of the stewardess and the bad conditions in which the toilets are left, which after so many hours and so many people who frequent them become unrealistic. Finally my seat, but it was bad luck, did not remain reclined but moved continuously upright. IT: Sul volo di ritorno da Los Angeles abbiamo viaggiato in Premium Economy avendo chiesto ed ottenuto un upgrade della classe di volo. Avendo avuto l'upgrade noi pensavamo di godere di tutti i privilegi di questa classe di volo tra cui la possibilitÃ  di imbarcare 2 bagagli da 23 Kg, invece all'aeroporto di LA abbiamo appreso che questo non era compreso nell'upgrade. Ora, se la compagnia mi offre un upgrade ( attraverso la partecipazione ad un'asta) dovrebbe anche specificare quali sono i servizi a cui il cliente ha accesso e quali no. Inutile dire che in aeroporto alle nostre rimostranze hanno fatto spallucce e la conclusione Ã¨ stata che siamo riuscite ad imbarcare due bagagli in piÃ¹ in quanto membri del Club Ulisse. Francamente erano tanti anni che non viaggiavo Alitalia ed in questa circostanza mi sono ricordata del perchÃ¨. Un'altra pecca che ho riscontrato Ã¨ la malagrazia delle hostess e le cattive condizioni in cui vengono lasciate le toilette, che dopo tante ore e tanta gente che le frequenta diventano improponibili.

The flight from Paris to Munich is 1 hour and full bar service was offered with a tasty sandwich. The flight from Munich to Tbilisi was three and half hours with excellent service. The hot meal was good, and it was nice of them to offer a bar service three times during the dinner. The crew team was exceptionally outstanding in their service, beyond the excellent that Lufthansa is known for. The chief of cabin was very attentive and made very good announcements before takeoff, during the flight and after landing (including new year and orthodox upcoming Christmas wishes). On this route, Lufthansa has excellent product in economy class.

American Airlines,1.0,G Reynolds,6th November 2014,"LHR-ORD return I have come to the conclusion that AA are probably the worst Airline I have flown with. First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing. During the outbound flight having slept for four hours and with no response to the call button I walked back to the galley to request a drink for myself and my family only to be told ""You have run us all ragged on this flight so we have closed up the galley and are resting so you'll have to wait for the meal"".",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,7.0,J Habesh,21st January 2011,It seems the common thread with most fliers on Aeroflot is that planes and flight service is good but the Airport in Moscow is no where near international standards. I agree! I flew one way from Yerevan Armenia to Moscow and on to Los Angeles. New Airbus planes good leg room and above average meals. The flight crew seemed like they would rather be elsewhere and were not very interested to assist when someone had taken my seat.

Staff very friendly and efficient. The second leg was on the 777 to Melbourne Via KL. What a horrible journey seating was very tight and plane was full to capacity. Service onboard was not good at all food was bad and the drinks service only came once. Staff seemed to be more intent on chatting in the galley than actually serving the passengers. The return was no better from DXB to MAN but plane was not even half full so this made it a bit more bearable. Why does Emirates insist on over crowding the 777.

Air Canada,5.0,Pascale Moreau,2nd October 2013,AC793 Rome-MTL Sep 15th. For the last 12-24 months our many experiences with Air Canada have been nothing but disappointing and far from a world class transporter standard. Both my husband and I are frequent flyers ( I personally take an average of 20 flights a year with Air Canada in North America or Overseas). I don't think it is normal that I have to clean the cabin (remove the cookie crumbs food) off my seat which is filthy stained clean the walls covered with spills and put my blanket on the seat to avoid having to change my clothing when I am heading off to a meeting. Those are things I had to do on my flight from Rome (and the same from Geneva London Paris) The last flight from Rome. The audio system was not working my tablet was broken and the overhead light of our entire row inoperative. We had paid for Business tickets and were standby so I paid an extra for preferred seat so I could have room for my injured knee the leg room was fine but I can tell you that the experience wherever you sit Economy or Business it is always the same: prepare a few napkins and sanitizer so I can have a decent place to sit before the flight.

The flight back was almost one hour late. The Boeing 737 on the flight back looked slightly tired, uncomfortable and worn seats and had not been cleaned properly before the flight (my tray was full of sticky spots and crumbs, cabin wall also had beverage splashes on it). In Frankfurt and Bologna we had parking positions away from the terminal which meant bus transfers - in Frankfurt they were quite long, plus 15 minute taxiing from the runway to our parking position.

The cabin crew was really patient, polite, and they were really helpful in curating the details, from each guests. It turne out that I forgot my amenity kit at home. As it was a night flight, I asked a member from the cabin crew and she said there were not any available in economy anymore, but she gave the chance to have one from Business class, which I was just in love because of the Brics design.

Qatar Airways,5.0,G Schumer,28th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Johannesburg with a long layover in Doha. The seats assigned seemed to be entirely random, no effort was made to keep us together, preference for window or aisle were largely ignored. My seat gave average legroom and width. The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 3/4 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row, especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you can't lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15+ hour flight from Doha, we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am, we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later. They came around with drinks several times and our choice was a juice or water, drinks were served at room temperature no ice was provided.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5.0,Mats Strandberg,20th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Murmansk to Moscow. I have been flying Aeroflot frequently since 1995 and clearly seen the huge improvement taking place during that period. I am a Gold Member of Aeroflot Bonus and have been that several periods during my 11 years membership of the program. It is with disappointment that I note a decline in customer centricity since 2013-2016. Especially the last 2 years the airline have become a â€œparagraph referring airlineâ€. Instead of being flexible with access to lounges for Gold and Platinum members with one guest (spouse) and child (non-teenager), they follow their rules and deny access in most of the cases. Big difference compared to few years ago. The same rigidity to upgrades to Space Plus in economy class, even with half empty planes. Snacks on short flights (1-3 hours) has been the same boring dark bread sandwich for over a year. When flying 6-8 flights per month, this sandwich loses its attraction after a few months. No variation at all. When addressing these issues to Aeroflot Bonus customer feedback desks, the same mechanical defense explanations appear, stating that â€œcrew is just following rulesâ€ and do nothing wrong - or, â€œthanks for your quality feedback on meals, we will review thisâ€, but nothing happens. Aeroflot until a year ago, was an airline I strongly supported and actually also promoted as much better than the reputation, but my experience in 2017-2019 have been flavored with negative impressions.

American Airlines,2.0,I Reano,1st December 2014,Nov 22 AA 1520 El Salvador to Miami. AA 2487 Miami to Orlando. Will never use this airline again. Connecting flights at Miami are the worst specially international flights. They schedule connecting flights within an hour and a half apart yet they land every international flight at terminal D in Miami 5-10 mins apart. On top of all this their outbound flights are late and incoming planes have to wait to have a new gate. What is the issue with this immigration and customs are 1 hour behind making it difficult to connect. You would think the airline can have someone trying to help you get through or guide you to reconnect to another flight well that is not the case.

American Airlines,1.0,H Walker,9th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York JFK to Manchester. American Airlines is probably the worst airline I've ever flown with. After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers.

Air Canada,5.0,M Steve,29th September 2013,YYZ-KIN-YYZ. Flew Air Canada's discount division Rouge to Kingston. Flight was packed on the outbound and boarding was chaotic due to passengers returning with copious purchases and multiple suitcases and carry-ons. Flight attendants are all new hires and so lack most of the basic skills expected of them. I purchased an extra leg room seat in one of the first four rows. Be aware that KIN check in agents will fill these seats with mothers and babies if you think you're getting a bit of respite. For purchase food selection was missing the healthy items inbound and outbound. Return flight was delayed 45 minutes when customer traveling with parent and 7 relatives including 3 newborns had not made proper arrangements for oxygen and crew struggled to deploy the onboard oxygen using FA manuals to sort out the issues.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Lawrence Osborne,14th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated. As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money. I'll leave Business trips to the big boys.",A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,BKK to JFK via IST,2015-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,3.0,Tanveer Ahmed,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I would like to share the horrible experience that I had flying with American Airlines. I bought tickets from them to travel from Toronto to Houston and return. Toronto to Chicago to Houston (01/24/2018) Houston to Dallas to Toronto (01/29/18) The flight from Toronto to Houston was ok except for an hour delay. Everything turned into a nightmare when we were travelling back from Houston. Our flight from Houston was at 4:20PM (45 mins flight to Dallas) and our connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto was at 6:25PM (2hr 25 mins to Toronto). We got on the flight at 4:20 and we were stuck there for almost 1.5 hrs. According to the captain the air control did not give clearance and the plane had to refuel since it did not plan for the delay. After 1.5 hours they informed that we will not be able to catch our connecting flight from Dallas so itâ€™s better to get off and re-book from Houston. We got off and asked to get our checked-in luggage. They said they cannot take that out and it will be going to Dallas. So we asked them what our options were since do not want to lose our luggage. During this time we got the notification that our flight was re-booked from Dallas at 7AM the next day (01/30/18), which meant we had to stay the night at Dallas. After discussing at the gate and with the flight crew they confirmed us that since we have a check-in baggage it will be better for us to go to Dallas and as it was an airline issue, accommodation will be provided for the night. We were convinced and agreed to get in the flight again and go for Dallas where we reached at 6:57PM (instead of 5:37PM) This is where everything started. After getting off the plane we went to talk to gate staff (as instructed) for our accommodation voucher and that is when they said ""Since it is not our fault, we will not be able to provide accommodation. In our system we see that it is coded for Tarmac delay due to clearance from Air Control which led to refueling"". We told them repeatedly that we were took off that plane and put back in and assured that there will be accommodation provided. We just had to talk to the gate. After that they said, ""Well sir, I do not see anything documented/coded in your account, therefore I cannot do anything. The best we can do is provide you hotels at distress rate"" The minimum amount of distress rate they offered was USD 65 without shuttle and if we wanted shuttle it would USD 75. Why would we pay anything? Was it our fault? We did not take their offer and the funny thing is the hotel we ended up staying â€œDays Inn hotelâ€ was available on Booking.com for USD 65 with shuttle service.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Carmen Reimer,1st July 2018,"Not Verified | I fly to and from Chicago and Phoenix Az a lot since we purchased a retirement home in AZ. My mother is 85 years old and I go back and forth every month to help her with Doc appts etc, as she does not drive. I had book a roundtrip ticket to fly to Chicago for May 23, 2018 and a return flight back to Phoenix on June 16, 2018. As the time got closer my husband decided to drive to Chicago so we could stay for the summer. We have two dogs so that is why he wanted to drive. We left Phoenix on May 19th it's a 3 day drive. While on our drive I didn't want to forget to cancel the flight so I decided to do it on my cell phone. Well anyone who has a cell phone knows that when you are traveling signal is not the greatest and in some areas not at all. I tried multiple to cancel my flight on my phone but I guess due to the signal it didn't go thru. I decided to screen shot my attempt at cancelling and would try again once I was at my destination on a landline. Well I forgot. I made a mistake. While here in Illinois on the 23rd of May I received an email from Southwest stating I was a no show for my flight. I immediately got on the phone trying to explain my situation to no avail. I was told because I didn't cancel my flight It cancelled the entire reservation, which is totally not fair. I agree that they didn't have to refund my flight to Chicago, but I also lost money for the flight for June. I am a regular customer I fly Southwest a lot since 2015. I only use Southwest, I sit there and read in the magazine all these great stories, this time my story is not so great. I have tried everything possible to get this rectified and nothing. I am totally disappointed in this airline. If I could tell the world my story I would, but my advice is never book a roundtrip ticket and never try to do anything on a cell phone while traveling thru the mountains. As for forgetting to do it later, It was a mistake on my part I am human.

Air Canada,1.0,Marie Hart,5th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | My husband and I travelled from Sydney to Chicago with a stop at Toronto. Hubby flew business class as his work paid for it, I flew economy. I attempted to get a business class seat two days after hubby, the price probably due to cookies had gone up $3000, so for a return ticket it went from $5000, to $8000 in two days. So I purchased an economy fare, Then I attempted to bid for an upgrade, I bid $2250, one way for an upgrade, that meant I would have paid $3250, one way. Initially Air Canadaâ€™s bid, as in it is a slider, was $3250, I moved the slider down to the lowest I could bid, coming up with $2250, one way. I received an email saying my bid was unsuccessful. So imagine my surprise to find empty seats in Business Class. So instead I purchase lounge access, which I paid fifty dollars. And got to use in Toronto. I found Air Canadaâ€™s lounge food is rubbish. Due to my unsuccessful bid to upgrade, Hubby and I decided to share his business class seat. However, on our leg home, one hostess was ok with it, whilst another hostess was downright abrupt and rude, claiming it was Air Canadaâ€™s policy that you canâ€™t change seats. It wasnâ€™t so much that the hostess made up a policy on the go, but it was her attitude demanding I get back to economy, yet she didnâ€™t have anything to say to my husband upon his return, not one word. So do I recommend Air Canada, definitely not.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Toronto,August 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,no

""Due to weather"" we were in the air for an hour on which I got left behind from my connecting flight. I got to the gate at 10.30 and the flight was departing at 10.40 and the plane left early. I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination.

Upon arrival to the boarding gate, the American posting board still read nonstop, and only at last minute were we informed that the plane would make a fuel stop in Kansas City. As this was a full flight, there was no overhead space for my carry-on so there I was stuck having to jam my luggage and backpack under the seat with no place for my feet. We sat on the ground for an hour, and ultimately arrived 2-hours late at our destination. A review of the AA615 activity log indicates this is not an uncommon occurrence. Some missed connections, I missed a lunch meeting. It is unacceptable to have an airline presumably save a few bucks on fuel at their passengers' expense.

We cannot afford the taxi since we have already spent so much on things we packed and have no access too, so we are left to wait. With no service on either of our american phones, the only option we have to get updates is to stay at the hotel where we can receive calls.

So, thatâ€™s strike one. Not out until 4:45am where thereâ€™s a line of at least 30 people. First flight to SLC was fine. The flight staff I liked, they were the only ones I liked. Super short layover at SLC. Get on at SLC, the new staff made a big deal about a pet and made sure I knew not to remove the dog from the crate. Land at RDU, have maybe 20 minutes to deliver a puppy, check in, and go through TSA. Oh wait, I am â€œtoo lateâ€ because I was on the plane for the last four hours and didnâ€™t check in at least an hour in advance and my seat was given away. I had no way of checking in when phone barely receives iMessage on the free WiFi. So I get a â€œseat requestâ€ and am told if Iâ€™m not fast enough that Iâ€™ll have to come back out and buy a new ticket. Strike two. After TSA, I sprint to my gate where I have seconds to spare. Luckily I have a seat left. During that flight is what sealed the deal. They offer flight fuel and meals. I wanted a specific one, I was given something else. Ok, I can deal. When the flight attendants come back to collect trash and recyclables, they never took mine.

I was woken up by the landing. I was happy to be off the plane. My recommendation for Delta is nonexistent. I wouldnâ€™t recommend them to my worst enemy.

Our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy, with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. It honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. This terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. We were offered only one meal from the menu, and there was no desserts, coffee or chocolates. The catering was terrible on this flight, however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. I had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a children's meal (despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult Business class ticket).

They constantly fed us and passed around with beverages. The A/C was just right. Alitalia it was so cold I felt like a piece of meat in a freezer. There seemed to be more room on the Boeing than the Airbus. Flight was good but the entertainment system was not working that well on our flight.

American Airlines,5.0,Stephen Lind,7th July 2015,"Coming off flights with Qatar Airways, I was on my last leg to New York with American Airlines. To start, the boarding began 20 minutes late because a previous American Airlines flight to Seattle was delayed. CDG is a shocking airport. I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him. Food was okay, main meal was decent, the ice-cream and snacks were excellent. Flight landed on time.

United Airlines,1.0,Steve Shanahan,16th January 2016,"Philadelphia to San Francisco, and United Airlines boarding system is archaic and ridiculous. Don't pick an aisle seat or you will end up getting on last and there will be no overhead space for your bag. When I was boarding, the Group 3, 4 and 5 lines were lined up for a long time since no one pays attention to this system knowing that they're going to get screwed if they try to get a bag in the overhead. I was a 5 and when our turn came, they suddenly announced that everyone (1/5 of the passengers) had to check their carry on bags at the counter because there was no overhead space available which caused complete chaos. After going through security and always getting x-rayed and patted down for no reason, facing this boarding madness feels like torture not to mention the long flight ahead. I did pay for the extra leg room but you get no priority boarding for that - you're just like the people who pay nothing extra. The crew look miserable and I can't say I blame them and the passengers seem sullen and depressed after the regimen they've been through. If companies like United Airlines want to encourage repeat business, they're going to have to realize that you can't treat people like animals and sometimes you might want to give them something to comfort their stress in flying - not even peanuts - they're so cheap.

The complimentary F&B included a scarce variety of sodas or coffee and a packet of pretzels, which was disappointing after travelling in some other airlines like JetBlue.

The person at the gate checked-in my cabin baggage for free, which added to my comfort. The boarding was well-organized as well.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,B Robertson,4th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | With the renewal of its cabins and now of its fleet, KLM definitely is in the lift. I had the pleasure of flying its brand new 787 from Osaka to Amsterdam and what a pleasure it was. The cabin lay-out is similar to what is found in other upmarket companies like EVA Air, with all the latest gadgets, including wifi on board. Checking in Osaka was standard, straightforward and fast, but the line for security was long. The lounge was nice and well-catered, but a bit cramped. Boarding was smooth and well-organised. The inflight service was excellent - good catering (both Japanese-based on the recipes of the famous Yamasato restaurant at the Okura in Amsterdam and western), and portions were copious. The atmosphere in the 787 cabin is very pleasant. However, staff hinted that there was little space for them in the pantries and that this hindered them in providing the desired service levels - not noted by me, at least. The flight departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. With the upgraded cabin lay-out in its old 747s and its 777s, KLM is now scoring high among its European competitors. Transit at Schiphol airport was smooth. And at the end of the flight I was lucky that Delft bleu house 96 was on board, so I have my collection complete again.

United Airlines,1.0,Peter Wise,3rd May 2014,I really don't know how to express my dissatisfaction with United. I buy business class and get dumped into economy. No explanation nothing. Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience. United advertising is good unfortunately they only talk the talk. United has yet to learn how to walk the talk. United just frustrates me to no end.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,no

So I have to stay in ORF airport for a lot of hours and Delta gets to give up the possibility of selling my seat on the later flight because they are unwilling to let a ticketed passenger on an earlier flight that had 20 ish seats empty.

Air Canada,1.0,Jane Jamieson,17th December 2013,AC Rouge to Samana (Dominican) December 8th returning the 15th 2013. I had never heard of 'Rouge' but was happy that I was flying AC with my 2 boys as they enjoy the TV's in the individual seats and AC is fairly reliable (based on about 4 decades of brand loyalty). I was disturbed to discover that they had taken all the TV's out of the individual seats and we could only access the in-flight entertainment if 1) we had known to download the app before we got on the plane as it won't download on an android phone. 2) Had an I/OS phone or Ipad or 3) rented an Ipad for $10 in flight - which would have amounted to $30 x 2 for the return flight. Staff appeared between about 20 and 25 years old and very immature and unable to make any decisions without asking the 'senior' attendant. They sounded rather robotic and lacked any sense of humour. The pilot never spoke on the way back we had some turbulence and we never heard from him. They offered us 2 free Ipads because I was unimpressed with their inability to entertain people without phones but the system was slow and unresponsive. Flight attendants disappeared for about 40 minutes off the top of the flight - nowhere to be found - very unprofessional. I paid more for my trip to Samana than virtually everyone I spoke to - and they flew other airlines that offered free meals and wine - we got nothing - and only 2 drinks on a 5 hour flight. Plane was delayed at the airport in Samana and then we had to wait about 35 minutes at our gate for a Sunwing plane to move out.

The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Nick Kambounias,28th October 2014,My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each. There was a huge line at the flight services counter with many people experiencing the same issue with connecting flights.

It was going to be our ""trip of a lifetime"" so we spent the extra money to try the first class experience we had heard so much about. We boarded the plane and were served drinks, but about an hour later we had to de-plane due to an electrical failure. We waited in the airport and were given hourly updates for the next 5-7 hours while we waited to board again and take off. Eventually the flight was cancelled. We got no information at the airport from Emirates about what to do, where to go, or how to rebook.

We went to the hotel and were not able to get information about rebooking our flight until 2:00 am. The flight went out the following day but involved 2 hours of waiting in line to get checked in. My husband is blind and I had one leg in a cast so the delay was really excruciating. We were awarded 100,000 Skyward miles for the inconvenience.

The service on the old and tired 767 was significantly lower than that on the 787. The touch screen on the 767 was not very responsive at all. I was very impressed with the in-seat bar service on the 787. At the touch of a button you could order a drink or snack from the comfort of your seat and it would be served to you within minutes. The international check in at Auckland Airport was a complete shambles with queues everywhere and a lack of order. I also don't understand why you can't check in online if you booked through a 3rd party travel agent. All other airlines allow this why not Air New Zealand? The domestic flight was excellent.

Emirates,9.0,J Kole,2nd January 2014,NCL-DXB DXB-BKK-HKG then return on the same flights. Outbound Newcastle to Dubai on 777-300ER. Very good flight - good food good choice ICE entertainment system. Dubai to Hong Kong via Bangkok on A380. Again very good flight - spacious seats and same ICE system as on previous flight. Food reasonably good on this leg of the journey but not as good as first flight. The choice I wanted was unavailable on BKK to HKG leg but the option I was served was nice enough. Return Hong Kong to Dubai via Bangkok A380. Same comments apply about A380 as before. Another good flight except food on this flight. Food on both HKG - BKK and BKK - DXB legs were poor and a massive contrast to the other 3 flights. I experienced the same on a previous Emirates Hong to Dubai flight so this looks a like a localised Hong Kong supplier issue. Dubai to Newcastle on 777-300ER - same as outbound - very good flight and very good food. Both 777-300ER and A380 used same ICE so same inflight entertainment across all flights - loads to choose from and good variety. Touch screen sometimes a little unresponsive on return flights. Cabin crew were generally good and helpful with queries but slow with food service sometimes. Outbound Newcastle departure was delayed due to late incoming flight but other flights were on time or within reason. Transfer in Dubai was easy and hassle free - around 2.5 to 3 hours each time. Overall except for the couple of things mentioned above very impressed with Emirates.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Aegean Airlines,5.0,A Christodoulou,21st February 2014,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

Qatar Airways,8.0,T Berri,11th August 2014,MXP-DOH (A320 business): Flew the refurbished A320 with the new flat-seat beds. Very comfortable to sleep on but the overall lack of space (as this is a narrow-bodied plane) makes you feel very close to your neighbours on either side. Service was rather disorganised with crew going back and forth constantly. Flight attendants were not rude but tended to be mechanical - this was a general impression I had on my other flights with Qatar. DOH- SIN-DOH (787 business): Amazing plane. Occupancy was low for this sector making an already spacious cabin seem more spacious with the seats very private. Lots of space for storage and seat was great for sleeping. Crew this time was better professional but not friendly apart from the cabin director who seemed genuine in welcoming people aboard. This is probably my favourite plane so far (better than the A380). DOH-MXP (A330): old plane with average seats (inclined flat seats not very comfortable for sleeping) washrooms were not very clean - the worst leg of the entire journey. The 'highlight' of this flight was excellent service from one Thai flight attendant: helpful and friendly. Overall: I found Qatar to be a well-priced airline offering good competent service. Food was above average (better than BA worse than SQ/Emirates) but portions were small (and I'm not a big eater). In- flight entertainment was a bit limited and the touch-screen controls were not the most intuitive and responsive. Plus with Qatar part of the Oneworld alliance - there are more opportunities to accrue points. Downsides: the shared Sala Montale lounge at Malpensa is depressing. Furnished well but lacking in refreshment offerings,,,,,,,,,,,,
Qatar Airways,7.0,Louise De Villiers,29th July 2014,Three of us flew between Cape Town and Casablanca via Doha in July 2014. The ticket price was very good. The leg from Cape Town and Doha on a new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent. The airport in Doha is brand new and there are excellent facilities for transit passengers. The flight from Doha to Casablanca was problematic. There was a 3.5 hour delay due to a faulty AV system on a rather old Airbus aircraft and the passengers had to endure a fair amount of discomfort as a result of this. The return flight from Doha to Cape Town on the Dreamliner was also delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and an electrical problem on the aircraft. The latter surfaced when the aircraft dropped passengers off in Johannesburg and had to depart to Cape Town. The food was average. Especially the light snacks were unsatisfactory. The crew members were very helpful and professional.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

The main meal served after take off was plain terrible! There was no choice of food at all! You had to have large macaroni in a tomato sauce and that was it for everyone, its was the worst meal ever served to us by any airline that we have traveled worldwide.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,N Chowdhury,30th January 2014,Geneva - Istanbul TK1918 19 Dec 2013. Istanbul - Dhaka 19 Dec 2013 TK0712. Dhaka - Istanbul 9 Jan 2014. Istanbul - Geneva 10 Jan 2014. No inflight entertainment on flight from Istanbul to Dhaka or from Dhaka to Istanbul. On January 9 flight from Dhaka to Istanbul was delayed 7 hours due to fog. When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience. There is a major difference in the quality of service (old planes no in-flight entertainment rude/unprofessional service) on the flight to/from Dhaka-Istanbul compared to flights to/from Istanbul-Geneva.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,no

The whole cabin has a very utilitarian design with nothing that says flying with United is an exciting experience. I have to say though that elements of the experience have improved over the last few years. A cloth hot towel has been re-introduced and even though they ran our of food items in the first class cabin the breakfast selection was good. Besides a scrambled eggs option they had a healthy oat bran choice as well that I really enjoyed. Moreover they also came by during the flight with a fruit basket. Great to see healthy food options being provided. Reminder: don't sit in the last row of the cabin like I did as the seat doesn't fully recline back.,,,First Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,yes

We were traveling from LAX to Dublin with a change of planes in N.Y. We sat in the plane on the ground for 2 hours at L.A.X. because of mechanical problems. Because of this we missed our connection to Dublin so had to spend the night in N.Y. From N.Y. They flew us to Atlanta the next day. Again there was airplane problems. We waited for two hours at the airport for them to find a plane that worked. It took us two days to get to Dublin.

I am 6""2 and athletic. I can't imagine what this seat would be like for an overweight. When I complained to the flight attendant she said 'at least nobody is going to recline their seat'.

United Airlines,8.0,Neil Ramsay,7th November 2015,"Check in at IAH was quick although we were overweight 1lb in one bag and were forced to transfer a jacket to the other underweight bag. I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs.

Emirates,4.0,Piotr Wegrzyn,8th April 2019,"Not Verified | Oslo to Singapore via Dubai. I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. My friends who have flown with them, told me that has very good food in economy class, and the cabin crew are friendly. This is the opposite of what I have experienced. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai on the 21st of March. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. Before the flight, I was happy that I could use the ICE, an internationally awarded In-flight entertainment system. I was really disappointed when I touched the screen, because it was unusable. The screen heated up to 40-50 degrees, and the touch didn't work well. The food was OK, but again, I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. Two members of the cabin crew were rude to me. The flight from Dubai to Singapore with A388 was really good. Plenty of legroom under the seat in front of me. Back to Oslo, I have ordered Vegetarian meal to try something different (I had Asian vegetarian meal from OSL to SIN). I was angry when they gave me vegan food. Is it so hard to see the difference between Vegetarian and vegan food?. It was definitely the worst meal I have eaten on an airplane. I recommend to choose an another airline if you have a possibility to do so. I could fly cheaper with Finnair or Qatar airways, but i choose Emirates only because they had the A380.",Boeing 777 / A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Singapore via Dubai,April 2019,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,Olivia LaGoy-Weltz,6th October 2015,"I have done 10+ flights this summer many of which have been on United Airlines. Every time I fly it's with the same roller board and the same boot bag for my tall boots (I train horses). Both items are always carried on no problem, the one goes over head and the boots under the seat - except tonight. I was stopped before going through security and told my roller bag was too big. I went to their kiosk across from security where it tuned out the Mobile boarding pass scanner wasn't working so he entered my info twice manually before deciding his system didn't work and I had to go to the desk. Annoyed I went around the corner and moved the jacket into my boot bag so the suitcase would fit in their bin. I went back to security where they didn't even ask to check the size of my bag but then told me my boot bag was too big. Keep in my my friend had gone through security with the same boot bag with her helmet attached to it not 5 minutes before and had not been stopped. Both the manager from United Airlines was incredibly rude as was the security staff. The manager threatened to not let me on the flight - all this over bags that easily fit on the flight and that had both been carried on all of my other United flights including the one to CA 3 days earlier. United is a highly short sighted company with a very poor customer service vision and corporate culture. They don't realize that by ruining a clients experience before they even get on the flight they breed a culture of rudeness. I am normally a model passenger - kind to other passengers, nice to the flight attendants, complimentary to the pilots - after this I have no reason to look at a United Airlines staff member in the eye, clear my trays from the security line, or engage in any kind of pleasantries.

When we checked in at the gate the gentleman at the gate was very short and rude and bluntly stated that we had not reserved our seating online as required when actually we had several months in advance. He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate. I would not recommend United Airlines to any families as none of our flights were accommodating to young families with kids and car seats as most airlines are.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Farouk Mogheth,23rd December 2013,Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin. Again no food onboard for a long flight. Will never consider this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

The seats are too close to each other and too narrow (30 ins pitch as LH). The food was unacceptable for a Greek airline that represents the country with the best cuisine in the world, both ways of my journey exactly the same food and each time worse that the previous one. Cabin crew professional but with attitude and poor training, Night flight and they left the lights on throughout the whole flight without dimming them, announcements were too loud and hasty (especially in English), asked for water twice and they forgot it both times.

United Airlines,1.0,Grundy Vanessa,8th August 2014,"We flew home from Germany to Alberta Canada we had a stop over in Chicago IL. United Airlines had the worst service we have ever had from an airline company. The people were very unhelpful. Here is what happened an explanation of why we are so disappointed. The customer service was the worst we have had. It was our honeymoon we boarded our initial flight in Barcelona Spain with a different airline they flew us to Germany at which point we were to get on our UA flight. The first thing that annoyed us was that the UA airline baggage people didn't even make an effort to get our luggage on our first UA flight (this is something we didn't find out until we were already in Chicago). The lady we spoke to in Chicago simply said ""you had a short layover and in cases like that we don't get the luggage because its too difficult."" Once we were in Chicago and realized our baggage hadn't made it onto our plane we were told that it would be very easy to give the UA baggage office our address and they would ship them to us the next day. So we landed in Calgary (an hour late) and went to the UA baggage office to report our missing bags and give our address to them. We waited at their office for 1.5 hrs. This was a very frustrating experience in regards to the baggage and customer service.

As a premium customer you get individually greeted here and they even offered to bring a round of premium drinks from the Business class selection.

I am unlikely to ever fly this airline again. From my flight being cancelled (Flight 263), to them loosing my luggage and blaming everyone else (Emirates, Me, Customs, etc) but themselves, to their inundated Customer Service people spending 30 to 60 minutes on the phone per customer to attempt to get them on other flights. I spent almost 6 hours at JFK figuring out what I needed to do as their customer service representatives were so unhelpful and made almost no announcements to anyone to let us know what was actually going on. I stood in one line for 2 hours and then another for another 2 hours and at no point were we given any clear guidance as to what was actually happening. Once I finally got a ticket out of New York for 2 days after the cancelled flight, I was told that JetBlue would not cover accommodation due to the flight being cancelled on account on bad weather. There was no bad weather in New York at the time that we arrived or the time the flight was supposed to depart. I spoke to several passengers who were all going to very different destinations, Seattle, Charleston, Boston, etc and all flights were cancelled which tells me that the weather issue was not the destination or on route, it was the source (New York), and seeing that there was actually no rain an just some clouds, it seems ludicrous that they would have us believe that the flights were cancelled due to bad weather. The fact that these sorts of things must happen every day, so for me to spend 6 hours in a airport, sorting everything from flights, to accommodation, to taxis, to my lost luggage which up to today no one had logged a ticket for, is absolutely unacceptable and it boggles my mind that they are still operating with this level of inefficiency, lack of procedure and incompetence.",,Business,Economy Class,New York to Seattle,July 2017,,,,,1.0,1.0,no

The airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their Dhaka bound flights. Now they are using their oldest A330-203 with no inflight entertainment at all. Seats are sometimes broken. Even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying. FAs are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this. They will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping. When I got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in Istanbul (5 hours away). Dhaka is not an easy destination but Turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger. In winter when there is morning fog in Dhaka Turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like Emirates or Qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by 5 hours without prior notification. It had now happened 3 times travelling from Dhaka or Istanbul. Only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Betty Pentier,22nd September 2013,I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights. Too bad they don't put that much thought and effort in to the actual flying part.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no
Southwest Airlines,10.0,W Leane,9th December 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Cleveland to San Antonio. So I was on my way to Lackland Air Force Base to see my nephew graduate I decided to schedule the flight with Southwest. The experience was wonderful. I like the fact that they acknowledge veterans on the flights thatâ€™s hard to come by these days. I booked the flights directly through Southwest using their app on my phone. We flew out of Cleveland to Atlanta then to San Antonio. The return flight was from San Antonio to Baltimore then to Cleveland.,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to San Antonio,January 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,8.0,S Vukas,2nd November 2016,Flew Lufthansa from Lima to Frankfurt. Gate was a bit too small for the pax load and boarding was delayed by 20 mins. I reserved a seat with extra space and it was great value for money. Cabin was clean and FAs well presented. Take off was delayed for almost an hour due ATC. It's overnight flight so dinner was served promptly after take off and lights switched off soon after tables were cleared. I slept for about 7h and extra leg room helped the experience quite a lot. Manged to watch a movie at the beginning and another at the end of the flight. I like Lufthansa's IFE as it is not focused only on commercial entertainment with music section being my favorite. Light breakfast was served 2h before landing. We landed with 30min delay but it did not affect my connecting flight with another company.

When our turn came the guy told us that he did only luggage drop off and invited us to line up again at the counter next to his. Quite a few people ahead of us. Then a few minutes later while we were still lining up we saw him checking people without any boarding passes. Then the person that checked us in was not any friendlier. This happened at the Jean Lesage Airport which was surprising because the people in Quebec were just the nicest people and because as Air Canada frequent users we never had to deal with such unpleasant people.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YQB to YYZ via YUL,September 2016,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,3.0,yes

It was our honeymoon and the flight attendants starting with the ground lady in LA at the counter when we checked in and the crew members treated us so special. They have done a wonderful job. A big thank to all the crew members for making us feel so special with the cake & heart decoration before we landed and during the flight we got pampered. We would fly with Qatar again.

Lufthansa,8.0,Debapratim Ghosh,24th December 2015,"Mumbai to Dresden via Munich. The experience on Lufthansa A330s is always quite good, as its 2-4-2 seating never make it really crowded (assuming you are at either of the sides) and hence easy for you to access literally anything, from food to the washrooms. The cabin crew were quite decent on the onward trip, but we had a really great Indian flight attendant on the return journey who amused us and a foreign student group by some hilarious taking-for-a-ride story. Nice to see a personal touch with the service. IFE was good too, but suffered a hitch on the way back. Thankfully, no one complained too much about it and the staff explained it quite patiently to us. Luggage handling is always efficient, and this was exemplified by the fact that my return journey had only a 35 minute layover at Munich, and that the bags arrived fine at Mumbai.

Air New Zealand,10.0,Richard Brown,25th May 2014,Napier-Auckland-Napier . Two smooth on time flights with the ATR 72 offering more comfort than many short haul jets. Service friendly and professional. Water/coffee/tea and biscuit offered as is the norm for short haul flights within NZ. Some readers bemoan this but would you get similar on a bus or train trip of one hour? Air NZ still offers boiled sweets prior to landing which is a simple but nice touch. Luggage delivered promptly at both ends and check-in efficient too whether assisted (Napier) or through automated machine (Auckland).

Emirates,3.0,V Panusa,16th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Munich to Jakarta via Dubai. The quality and service with Emirates has gone downhill within years. Upon arrival in Munich, I am informed that one of the seats in the A380 is damaged and been told to change the seat. In addition to that, customer ignored the seating requested. The seat is damaged was located in the window seat and only middle seat available, because it is a full flight. Never experience like this before on other airline. The first food was edible and the second one (before landing) was awful. The entertainment on my seat was broken, asking staff for help but ignored this helped. The WI-FI is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. Last leg on DXB-CGK this is at least better than the MUC-DXB route which everything works fine. The service on the A380 was unacceptable with lack of customer support who decides on changing seat for the customers that flies the A380. In the future, I will avoid their A380 because of this issues with IFE etc. I have sent complaint to the airline which Iâ€™m still waiting for any replies about this experience.",A380 / Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Jakarta via Dubai,January 2018,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no

Delta Air Lines,3.0,Ashley Schmidt,8th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Diego to Syracuse. I'm extremely dissatisfied with my experience with Delta. After arriving at San Diego International Airport at 430am for my 7am departure our flight was delayed over and hour. This delay was not due to weather. We landed at JFK Airport and we waited well over a half hour to even get off to a gate to de-board. This caused me to miss my layover to Syracuse, NY. Although Delta did pay for the next flight out to Syracuse, NY via Delta airlines, this turned into a 4 hour layover. Now that we are finally ready to depart from JFK and finally on my way home after an exhausting day of unexpected travel, we are again delayed not due to weather but waiting an another plan to land so other customers can make this connecting flight. We were supposed to depart at 856 and it's been 40 minutes. Yes, I'm frustrated but also upset due to the inconsistency of the airline - why couldn't my Delta connection wait for all the passengers from JFK to Syracuse instead of leaving right at that moment.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Syracuse,December 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no

Emirates,9.0,J Kercher,18th May 2015,I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

I was forced to check my brand new bag, his response was ""I should've gotten to the gate earlier"" well if my connecting flight was delayed i wouldn't me in this situation.

No problem except leg room which is rather uncomfortable if you are somewhat tall (5' 8"" and my husband is 6'0"") and it was very warm on the plane. Coming back what really bothered me was that going to the restroom early on in the flight the trash was full and the pump soap was empty. Someone had thrown bars of soap onto the counter.

American Airlines,2.0,L Donovan,14th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | St. Louis to Boston via Charlotte. Im a frequent traveler and I have pretty minimal expectations when it comes to flying economy. However, Americans Airlines does not meet any standards as far as timeliness or customer service. My first flight was delayed because we did not have any flight attendants. They were leaving the airport within minutes if boarding time. The gate attendants made their frustrations pretty clear. Actually- between both crews, the employees were speaking very unprofessionally within earshot. Even worse, this delay was because the flight attendants had â€œrequiredâ€ rest from a three hour delay the night prior. They could not begin the shift and we cannot board without them. If this was known in advance, why was the flight not delayed or alternate attendants provided? The gate ladies were livid at the lack of communication by AA. I nearly missed my connection. On my second flight, there were mechanical issues. This was announced after the left the gate and we had to turn around. We were stuck in the plane. Even worse- I was in the back row next to the toilet (which was being frequently used with the delay) and the woman in front of me was sick. She was sneezing, coughing, blowing her nose. The couple next to me moved To the other side of the plane. There were 10+ Empty middle seats on the plane. I said I was afraid of getting sick and sensitive to the smell of the toilet. I asked if I could move like the couple did and the attendant said no. I paid the base rate for my ticket. Group 9 canâ€™t move around seats. Even under special circumstances.I flew with American a couple days ago as well. There was no WiFi. On another rip I was deplaned over an hour. As I mentioned, I fly often. I am going to miss work today. Thank you for making this an easy decision for me.

Turkish Airlines,6.0,T Eldem,24th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Istanbul. Check in and boarding were smooth. Onboard, the aircraft interior looked worn, the air was stale and sticky. The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapÃ©s, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley. Toilets were kept in reasonably good state throughout the flight. The wifi was good and operated without interruption. The flight left late but landed on schedule.

Was feeling a little thirsty before take off and asked one of the cabin crew members for water. It was the most unpleasant exchange I have had with an airline staff. The conversation went: Me: excuse me, can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff (male): what's that? He asked the question in a very rude manner and looked visibly annoyed that I was asking him something. I would have expected something along the lines of: ""I'm sorry mam, I did not hear you."" In any case, I repeated my question. Me: Can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff: Well we're about to take off so I can't. I did not catch the rest of his answer because as he started responding he simply turned around and continued talking as if he wasn't talking to me - all this in a very rude and angry tone. I thought to myself I'm only asking for a glass of water and if indeed it is not possible now, the correct and polite answer would have been: ""I'm sorry mam, but unfortunately we are about to take off so it is not possible right now. We'll bring you a glass after take off."" For someone who travels quite a lot with major airlines and have platinum level with some airline mileage programmes, I was quite shocked because this is really the lowest in terms of the quality of in-flight personnel.

Lufthansa,10.0,C Huang,16th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I had a flight from Munich to Frankfurt via Lufthansa then a connecting flight to Toronto via Air Canada. I missed my connecting flight due to delay in loading luggage. I was stranded at Frankfurt airport and had to find out what next to do. It was my first time missing a connecting flight. The staff at Lufthansa was knowledgeable and help direct me to the service desk (although it took a while, understandable due to the size of the airport). At the service desk, the employee was helpful and kind. I was giving a voucher for the hotel, dinner, breakfast, and transportation. They put me on the next flight to Toronto for the next day. This helped alleviate my distress and it showed that Lufthansa strived to do right by their customers when a mistake is made. On the flight, the staff and Lufthansa work hard to make the economy not feel like an economy cabin. We were given hot towels twice, headphones, blankets, snacks, drinks, and food. I've been to other airlines and they don't usually give out that much. It makes the flight bearable and quick.

Air New Zealand,3.0,Mark Berasley,5th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | The test of an airline is how they do when things donâ€™t go to plan and while Air New Zealand does a good job when things are going well, they failed miserably for me. On a recent trip from Los Angeles to Adelaide return via Auckland, our outbound aircraft from LAX was late arriving from London. They chose to hold our plane for customers out of London to clear customs as opposed to offloading them from our aircraft and putting them on the other flight to Auckland which is scheduled after the one I was on. They boarded us and then made us wait on the aircraft for 1.5 hours waiting for passengers. We arrived in Auckland just as my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. Even though they held us for 1.5 hours in LAX, they did not hold our flight to Adelaide for 45 minutes. They rerouted us through Sydney. We boarded the flight to Sydney and then proceeded to sit on that aircraft for more than an hour waiting for the passengers from the trailing flight from LA. Also, they did not give me a boarding pass in Auckland while other passengers were given their boarding passes. Because of holding the flight to Sydney, we then missed our connecting flight in Sydney and essentially we just dumped to Virgin Australia and Air New Zealand washed their hands of us. On my original Auckland to Adelaide flight I had a Works Deluxe ticket which is similar to a business class ticket but on the Virgin Australia flight they did not acknowledge a much higher priced ticket. I wrote to Air New Zealand and it took them more than two weeks to respond and provided an unsatisfactory response. Also, because of the issues I tried to access my reservation online and could not. I called and they redid the booking. However, when I got to the airport for my return, they had removed my Works Deluxe from Adelaide to Auckland even though it was on my original ticket. Further, on the return from Auckland to LA I had bid for a one up and they gave it to me at a cost even though there were empty seats remaining and this could have been a way for them to demonstrate they had not done a job they should have done on the outbound. In total the poor judgement by Air New Zealand added seven hours to my travel to Adelaide and I was on the phone with them for over an hour working on getting me online access to my return travel and they did not provide the miles due to me from Auckland onward. In both LAX and Auckland ground staff also showed indifference to the passengers trying to find out what their status was. They demonstrated a total lack of respect for the time of the travelers.",Boeing 777-300,Business,Premium Economy,LAX to ADL via AKL,November 2016,4.0,4.0,,,1.0,3.0,no

She said ""I need to work on the voucher people first"". I was second in line at that point and I asked ""will you at least call the people who were in line first?"" She said she would take my name",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lufthansa,3.0,H Richards,15th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I recently flew from Manchester to Atlanta via Frankfurt and back with Lufthansa. I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly Â£1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying Â£20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (Â£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the Â£80 back.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Atlanta via Frankfurt,April 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,no

Lufthansa,3.0,W Staab,14th January 2015,JFK-Frankfurt-Budapest then Vienna-Munich-JFK. Tried to book seats online after booking flight but now Lufthansa only allows seats to be booked online by paying a fee (amount depending on the seat chosen) until 23 hours prior to the flight time when online booking of remaining seats is free. First aggravation. Start was delayed 2.5-3 hours due to late arrival of aircraft at JFK- no weather problems all other European flights left on time only this Lufthansa flight was late. The plane was a 747-8 not full had 3 seats for myself. Food not of high quality but the service throughout was exemplary - superb. Arriving in Frankfurt of course missing connecting flight to Budapest with a 4.5 wait for next flight. Asked Lufthansa in Frankfurt if I could have use of a lounge during the long wait and was outright denied that privilege though they gave me a 10 Euro certificate for something to eat in the meantime but as we had passed customs there were no restaurants available in that area only snack bars so had a torte. Flight to Budapest was routine sandwich and drinks. Luggage arrived timely in Budapest. Return to JFK with short flight Vienna to Munich (drinks but no snacks) - then Airbus 330 Munich to JFK which was quite cramped as to seating even on the aisle. Food barely passed muster (metal cutlery though) as Lufthansa has declined dramatically in their culinary department but again the Flight attendants were magnificent many drink runs and staff courtesy and organization superior to both Swissair and Austrian flown on similar routes in the last months (Austrian has the best food of the 3 airlines but being owned now by Lufthansa that too has declined considerably from a few years ago). The new 747-8 had a quieter flight than most other planes flying transatlantically. Without the inability to book seats earlier than 23 hours before each flight and the very late departure of the flight to Frankfurt from JFK I would rank Lufthansa higher than a 3 - probably an 8 despite uninteresting bland meals.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Shannon Broyles,20th November 2014,What began as a simple flight from San Jose CA to New York NY (JFK) connecting at LAX has resulted in frustration and anger. Upon arriving at San Jose international airport with two hours to spare my fiancÃ© and I each checked a bag. Our flight was projected to leave at 2.45pm PST and read 'On Time' on the departures kiosk. Without any announcement or updates our flight arrived late had to be refuelled and in turn was 30 minutes delayed. We missed our connection at LAX by five minutes and after spending far too much time in the customer service office were rebooked on a 9.30 Delta flight to JFK. Told there was no need to check-in all we would have to do is go to the gate and speak to the representative at the counter. An hour before our flight we walk to the appropriate gate only to be told that while we were listed as passengers there were no seats for us and that American should have booked seats on our behalf. We returned to the customer service office spending an hour waiting in line. An American Airlines rep took us from counter to counter trying to find us two seats on any plane. The only availability was on a place via Nashville to LaGuardia with an hour layover. As we were boarding we were pulled off the plane because he had found us a direct flight to JFK which would make finding our bags that much better. Finally arriving in JFK at 7.15 am our bags were nowhere to be found.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

We flew from St. Louis to Denver on March 9. Our return flight on March 14 was canceled due to lack of crew, which was understandable given that a major storm had canceled over 1000 flights the day before. Our luggage, however, was flown on to St. Louis without us on a different plane. There were so many flight cancellations and issues that our first available flight home was 3 days later, on March 17. United refused to compensate us for expenses incurred due to being separated from our bags because we do not fit the typical baggage delay case. If an airline recognizes that compensation is warranted for clothes and toiletries when bags are delayed, should not the same be true when your luggage flies on without you?

I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight.

Virgin America,10.0,Conyers Russell,19th March 2015,On 8th March I flew Virgin America in economy from SFO to LAS for $49.00 return. Was looking forward to the flight and it proved to be a positive experience. I was a bit put off by the loud rock music blaring by the check-in kiosk and a rather indifferent ground attendant herding people to and from the check-in area. I feel that airports are confusing and loud enough without the added distraction of loud music. I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived. The seats in First are very comfortable and pre-take off drinks were served by a very pleasant stewardess.

I was 30 minutes from the airport so I rushed, incredibly fast, to find my flight had been cancelled not only once more, but three more times. Now, finally after boarding and waiting four hours to take off due to adding 360 miles to the trip, having to fuel up with 2,000 more pounds of fuel and maintenance problems, here we sit. With no word for almost exactly 3 hours. I had to call DFW to find out why exactly there were no gates available. No food, no water until orange juice was offered at about 2 and a half hours in.

Qatar Airways,9.0,D Lee,20th May 2015,Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good.

The crew were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and nicely presented and served by our attentive stewardess. We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days. I have been a frequent air traveler for 55 years so I remember the good old days of travel.

I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,D Barceso,20th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Phoenix to Atlanta. This was the first time for me, luckily, to fly on one of the planes with the ""upgraded"" seats. Never again. In fact, I may never fly SWA again unless I absolutely have to. These new ""seats"" have pencil-thin ""arm rests"", without padding, meant to discourgage people from using them - and that design works: if you don't mind elbowing your neighbor, you'll get bruised from the ""arm rest"". The shoulder / arm area is thinner than normal, and unlike the older seat design, even very thin people, such as myself and the passenger on my one side, will be bashing elbows and rubbing legs when constantly shifting positions to try and get away from the constant pain of the seats. See, the seats have no padding. NONE. They seem to be made out of cardboard. There is not just no lumbar support or seat padding: it's shaped oddly the opposite that seating for humans dictates: the lumbar region of the seat goes back rather than forward toward your back, and the seat curves up at the part right under your upper-upper thigh (the seats are also the shortest depth of all seats). While you are hunching your shoulders forward to avoid being shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to bring your elbows in front of your chest and hold them there, while your lumbar region is being pushed into an outward curve by the back of the torture seat and your legs have circulation being cut off by the upward curve of the seat edge. After 30 years of flying only SWA for all domestic flights - 8+ in the past 8 months - I will not be flying with them again unless absolutely necessary. This flight was yesterday, and I am experiencing moderate neck, back, and leg pain as a direct result of SWA's torture seating.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Atlanta,January 2018,1.0,5.0,,,3.0,1.0,yes

However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell.

When I arrived at the United customer service at Houston Airport, they said that It was not a record of the maintenance. So weather does not pay for the hotel. They denied that it was maintenance.

The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen.

There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land.

United Airlines,8.0,S Rabin,14th September 2014,LHR-SFO. Connecting to this flight from Brussels on Brussels Airlines maybe 4 or 5 folks on this flight going to the SFO flight. Brussels flight late connecting time tight for LHR (scheduled for 70 minutes more like 25 with the late flight and you have to go through security to get to US). Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me. Food reasonably good,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lufthansa,10.0,Matteo Tonelli,25th March 2016,"Flew from Pisa to Chicago via Munich. If traveling Lufthansa I recommend passing in their splendid Munich hub. The first flight, from Pisa, was quick and easy, leaving on time, with respectful crew and beverages. No entertainment options on this flight because it is only a quick regional 1-hour flight. Had 1:25 minutes to catch the long international flight. The A340-600 that was used for the 9-hour flight was splendid. The seats were comfortable, as I was seated in 45k, which is the second row of economy. Inflight Entertainment (IFE) worked great, with the touchscreen functionality being as smooth as any tablet, unlike most planes. Very good selection of movies, and TV shows and games were also available. Food was great, giving plentiful food that left me satisfied during the entire voyage. We arrived in Chicago 10 minutes in advance, even though we left 10 minutes behind schedule. Deplaning was as efficient as boarding. All in all, I had a pleasant experience (especially since I could sleep), and arrived Chicago nice a refreshed.

We booked our own flights with a package holiday. This meant we could fly from our local airport, get seats that were 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3 for the long flight and save nearly Â£700. It was easy to book window seats on the left for a good view of the Himalayas on the way in - just phone them 99 days before the flight. I got through very easily (in contradiction to what other reviews say) and was treated with respect. No charge for seats. I chose 30A and B for the long flight to be behind the wings - they were good but a few seats further back would have been even better. Complementary food and drinks and was better than most airlines. You even get metal cutlery. Good, clean modern aircraft. Entertainment system worked fine on all 4 flights. Good cabin crew.

In fact there was certainly no lack of friendliness or smiles from the cabin crew unlike other reviews on this site.

Air Canada,5.0,Steven Perreault,2nd August 2016,"We purchased tickets for our son and his friends with Singapore Airlines from Tokyo to Montreal. The LA to Montreal leg was with Air Canada. We had many choices for this second flight but we chose Air Canada because it is Canadian and because both airlines are star Alliance members. The layover in LAX was 10 hrs so we decided to purchase access to the Maple Leaf lounge in LAX. To be able to purchase access to the lounge, the ticket had to be a Flex or Latitude class ticket which it was. Air Canada refused the possibility of purchasing lounge access because the ticket is originally purchased through Singapore rather than Air Canada.

Their prices can't be beat for the quality you get. I personally like the seating setup, where you choose your seat based on a ""first come, first served"" basis regarding check in time. If you are traveling with young children, they do allow you to do family boarding after the small first round of people, so you can almost always find seats together. Seat room is a bit better than average, but nothing to write home about. Two free checked bags plus a carryon and personal item is unreal. Where Southwest really shines, however, is their customer service. They're funny, helpful, and always seem to be smiling. The flight attendants are especially good with kids. Overall, if you're used to high class flying, this may not be the airline for you as it lacks the preselected seating option and has only one class.

Originally, I had been supposed to take a 8:19pm connecting flight at Boston to go to Philadelphia from Tokyo. As soon as the flight from Tokyo landed at Boston Logan Airport, I received two texts notifying the delay without being provided any reasons. At that moment, the flight was still supposed to fly at 10 pm, so I decided to stick to it and I checked my suitcase in. After that, they keep sending the delay notifications, which ended up saying ""the flight was cancelled and your new flight is 5:25 am one"" As expected, they never provided any reasons at all and I was kicked out of the security area around 12am, which forced me to spend some 4 hours outside and come back to line up for the security again around 4 am. When I asked about my suitcase I checked in at the gate after this reschedule, the crew said ""that is a separated system and we have no information."" The new flight departed without any trouble and I got my suitcase at Philly airport, which was the only good news. After I came back home, I posted a complaint through their system, which is not responded at all for more than 2 days.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,Laurence McCarthy,25th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | London to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. First flight with KLM and was a bit apprehensive, as connection from London was very short. The SkyTeam Lounge at Heathrow is adequate, enough space to sit and have a quiet drink and a snack. There is WiFi. Catering OK, but my usual carrier is Etihad, so the experience was a little different, no a la carte table service. Flight boarded at T4 from the gate opposite the Lounge, very convenient. At Schipol we had just about 50 minutes from touchdown to the onward connection, which was enough time to have a quick drink, find our way to the gate and immediately board the next flight. With such a short connection I was worried our luggage wouldn't make the flight, but when we arrived at KUL there it was! The new World Business Class is very open and comfortable. The seating is great, save for the fact that you have no direct aisle access for the window seat. If you are travelling as a couple this is fine, for solo travellers it might prove tiresome. The on-board service was great, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful. The catering was OK, very Dutch shall we say! The drinks were good quality, but a bit mean. Nothing that one could really grumble about. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new and classic programming to keep me entertained until bed time! The bed is great and I slept like a baby. Even though they are older aircraft I like the sense of space you get with the Boeing 777, which somehow you don't quite feel on other aircraft even the 380. The price was comparable to Etihad (about GBP 300 more) but the flight is 1hr to AMS, a 1hr layover and then a 12hr leg to KUL. Reverse journey the same timings. For EY you have a 3 or 4 hour layover and now they have adjusted their timetable you have to either leave UK early in the morning or arrive very late to KUL. The KLM timings are much friendlier. We left LHR at 17.00 and arrived in KUL 16.00 a much less stressful journey.

Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Tom Payne,22nd November 2015,"Chicago to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. This was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance. I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people. I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers. I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul. But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it. The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will. It is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service.",,Business,Business Class,ORD to DUS via IST,November 2015,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Richard Harris,29th February 2016,"I just returned home from an American Airlines flight and before I settled in at home I felt obligated to write a review. The Miami airport was the most miserable travel experience of my life. After spending a wekk at the wonderful W hotel, I was met with rude American Airline agents at every corner - from the bag check in, to security. Angry, rude, completely unprofessional. At bag check in we were met with 90 percent of the kiosks out of order. Then we were yelled at regarding proper protocol for checking bags as if guilty of something. Then without any direction to where our gate was we roamed the enormous airport without any guidance from our baggage check in. Upon arriving at the gate, the airline agent followed the airline consistency of rudeness reprimanding us for showing up only 20 minutes before the flight was departing, which was insane considering we still stood in line for 20 minutes to board the plane. Upon getting on the plane, I greeted the flight attentendant with ""how are you today"", only to be met with a deer in the headlights attitude of why was I even talking to her. Then to end this complete miserable experience, my luggage was lost. The luggage specialist told me the luggage was placed on the next flight rather than ours. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before out flight, I asked her why this had happened. Her response was I have no idea. I then asked if I would received some sort of credit for this inconvenience and my luggage being delivered within 5 days, which she said no we don't do that. The lack of professionalism at every corner was astonishing. I flew Jet blue recently and the flight was bumpy and they credited every passenger 50 dollars, they are a class act. American Airlines seems to have been reduced to a modern Peoples Express. I am sure the CEO gets a handsome salary, but frankly is not doing their job with having such chaos and poor customer service exist at every level through a passengers experience. Horrible experience which could have been easily avoided with some proper management in place, customer satisfaction protocol in place for errors made by the airline, rather than treating customers like cattle with complete disregard for a pleasant experience. Management of this company should be ashamed. People's airline reincarnate, shameful.",Boeing 737,Business,Premium Economy,MIA to BOS,February 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,10.0,C Johnson,30th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Tampa. I was skeptical about trying United Airlines again since I had bad experiences before. The pilot did everything in his power to get us out of ORD early but alas we got out late due to traffic on the tarmac. Not their fault. So when I landed in TPA, I was in a rush to get off so I can get my dog and go home to sleep since I had work the next day. Once I got home, I realized that my iPad was not with me. I call the United help line, which they werenâ€™t much help. Then as I was trying to contact TPA again, United called me. I described my lost iPad and they said that it will be locked up for me to get. Great customer service.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,November 2018,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,8.0,J Johnsen,19th December 2015,"Miami to Bangkok via Istanbul. The food was great, the service and seats good. Turkish Airlines is much better than any US airline I have flown. The class separation is weird though. We were served start to finish before economy was served drinks. (I went to the lav and the curtain was open.) I don't understand that. I paid for more room so I could sleep but not to be treated differently. The entertainment options were very good. I love being able to see out the front of the plane when in the airports. I also liked the hot towel, Turkish Delight, flight bags and blanket but I wish the blanket were washed rather than perfumed. The over-ear headphones were great. Of four flights only one was on time. I didn't miss any connections because the next flight was 2 hours late and I had a very long layover. I spoke with a young man who had an overnight layover in Istanbul. I don't know where he stayed but he sent me a text saying Turkish Air paid for his room! I don't know how comfortable it was but anything is better than the airport overnight!

Delta Air Lines,8.0,Alek Perovic,7th September 2015,"There have been a lot of negative comments of Delta Air Lines business Elite seats and I initially thought of them as being overly critical, until I had a first hand experience on my recent flight from JFK to Moscow. The seats are narrow, but so are many other airlines. What I liked was the configuration with single seats in a zigzag pattern on either side of the plane giving privacy to single travelers. Not much storage space, though. It's the tunnel like part of the pod where one's legs go in when the seat is in full flat position. The space is so confined that it's impossible to keep the feet straight up, forcing a person to lie on one's back only, unable to bend knees, requiring a contortionist skills to attempt sleeping on the side. The feeling is actually of being forced into a very narrow coffin. I honestly could never imagine being so uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a plane. I wonder if anyone at Delta actually tested the seats before installing them, certainly would fire those responsible for the decision! It ruined an otherwise highly pleasant flight, with professional and attentive crew, good and tasty food and extensive entertainment choices.",Boeing 767,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York JFK to Moscow,September 2015,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,no
Emirates,3.0,N Williams,26th May 2014,BKK-LGW-BKK. The aircraft are fairly new and in good shape as you'd expect. The service is very hit and miss mostly a miss. On one leg shortly after takeoff the crew distributed promising looking menu cards but this was just a tease since no food materialised until almost 5 hours into a 6 hour flight. The purser spent the flight in and out of the understair workstation adjacent to my seat on the A380 slamming the door each time. When the food did arrive it was poor. On another leg the food was served in the first couple of hours and was very enjoyable being salmon and mashed potatoes. They seemed quite happy to bring the odd glass of wine throughout all the flights. On one leg we were bussed to the aircraft at Dubai which was strangely parked in a very remote part of the airfield. All those gates at Dubai and we end up having a 20 minute bus ride and climbing steps to the aircraft. The customer service at Gatwick was very poor. Although the ground staff had all week to advise me of a requirement regarding my return flight (I visited their desk on several occasions) they failed to do so and waited until I arrived at check in with all my bags and then turned me away.

American Airlines,6.0,Davide Greco,11th December 2013,Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,5.0,no

The flight was eventually cancelled, I have never had to deal with a cancelled flight before but I know it happens, so the staff should know how to handle these situations. I couldn't be more wrong. After standing in the customer service line for 40 minutes, I was handed a piece of paper with an 800 number on it, to then sit on hold for another hour, only to be told I would be issued a refund, or I could wait until the next day for a flight to my destination. I was traveling alone with my 7 Month old baby, and had only her diaper bag of limited supplies. The staff was absolutely useless, and very rude. One staff member rolled her eyes at me, and another man said to me, ""I can't control the airline, it's really not my problem."" I have never received such horrible customer service and this is absolutely unacceptable. I had to come up with different options for the staff to work with me, essentially doing their job.

Lounge access smoothly provided in KGL and DOH and they were both excellent. All Boarding Passes issued at Check-In in Kigali. Online check in possible but constitute a nuisance as the BP issued are not respected/valid in KGL. Flights from Central Africa are derouted from KGL to DOH which cost some 2-3 hours additional flight time due to flight ban over UAE. Pre-departure drinks offered on both flights. Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat (1st flight). FA and service onboard good, but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded (they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only). No ice-cream.

The lounge at SFO is futuristic but unattractive with an overdose of reds and blacks and uncomfortable seating. Boarding was quick with no problem. The flight crew was aloof and seemed preoccupied. They all wear street clothes. Although well attired - no uniforms? It appears very unprofessional and exudes little confidence. There is no closet for garments. I was told to store my jacket in the overhead bin - really? In first class? Food service was mediocre at best. A choice of two appetizers and two entrees. We ordered the rice noodles main course and as I don't expect anything close to gourmet food the food was cold and inedible. The flight attendant was nowhere to be found although seen frequently during the flight sitting in the jump seat in the galley.

While at the gate in Saint Louis waiting to depart, the captain announced that the plane is off balance and he needs to do some adjustments, so he makes the announcement that all women must sit at the front of the plane and the men must go to the back of the plane (safety first, no problem). Meanwhile all of this meant that we were 45 min late to depart Saint Louis, later on during the flight the captain announced that he realized that some of us had connecting flights and put our minds at ease by saying that the connecting flights would wait for us. Our flight from Toronto was to departure at 10:10pm, after sprinting through the airport we got to the gate at 10:05pm, the girl at the gate told us that she was told to release the plane.

The seats are very narrow with a 3-3-3 configuration and being in a centre seat it was a very tight squeeze for 5.5hrs (I'm not overly large, 175cm, 78kg). On sitting down it felt as if the seat had no padding and was extremly hard. The crew were lovely, the food was OK and we certainly didn't feel tired on arrival due to the 787 but what a squeeze.

Aegean Airlines,5.0,M Murray,28th July 2013,Automated check in at El. Venizelou Airport was not easy for this first timer and while I could chalk it up to my age other passengers were also having difficulty. At 6:30 am there weren't enough ground staff to help make the process any easier but I finally managed on my own. It has the potential to be a great improvement once the bumps are ironed out. Found seating cramped and the fact that the seats do not recline a real disadvantage. Fortunately it was only a 3 hour flight but I had counted on making up for lost sleep and that proved to be impossible.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,,,,3.0,no

We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long.

Aegean Airlines,1.0,Fiona Bechelli,28th August 2014,Travelling from Athens to Santorini in August 2014. Flight was delayed. Not enough seats in airport lounge. No drinks provided. Only given a cookie. Travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag. We then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to Athens if there were sears available. We were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight. Offered us a 20% discount on a full new fare. Online price was only euro 117 to 131. We had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300. This spoilt our European vacation.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,M Thompson,19th June 2013,23-27 May 2013 Columbus OH - CMH to Ft. Lauderdale FL - FLL. Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes.

The flight out of Montreal departed on time. The small Embraer was in very good condition and the short service and snacks was enough for this short flight. Connecting through EWR from Canada is not an issue as immigration is pre-cleared, so I headed directly to the lounge. The food offerings are not that great and the lounge is crowded, but drink variety is good, lounge is clean and service very good.

Air New Zealand,7.0,Robert Patton,25th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Auckland to Houston. Seat 2K is a window seat on the right side of the cabin. It is row two of the nine rows in Business Class on version 2 of ANZâ€™s 787-9. Three seats abreast herringbone configuration. The crew walks past this seat, over and over, delivering food and drinks to the seven rows of business class passengers behind it, as do passengers on their way to the business-class galley and restrooms. On my outbound flight to Auckland I sat in the last row of business class. It was a better, quieter, more private experience. Overhead storage for seat 2K, like all other window seats, is consumed by bedding. The first three rows of the center section have zero overhead storage (though the bedding can be stored behind those seats), so the passengers in the center seats must use the storage space that would have otherwise been available to passengers in the window seats. The fellow from the center seat had already filled the half of the bin that was not filled with bedding. Space is limited to begin with, and there is no usable underseat space. I pulled my mattress and pillow out of the overhead storage bin so that the fellow in the center seat and I could both stow our carry-ons. When the FA told me I couldn't put the mattress in the sizable, yawning cavity behind my seat, I told him he should try to find a space for it. So he took it away into the nether regions of the forward galley. As I sit here, my shoes are under the ottoman and there's a pillow and blanket on the floor where my feet are supposed to be. There's no armrest for my right arm. Crew is really nice in dealing with my, er, ""concern"" about the lack of storage space. Probably as exasperated about it as I. They are as pleasant, tactful, and as helpful as they can be. Really delightful people, dealing with what seem to be poor design features. They served champagne before departure, and that was nice. There's a little fold-out shelf behind my right arm and shoulder, but I don't know that it has any practical use. It is also lit, for some reason known only to Boeing and, presumably, ANZ. It's certainly not a place to put an empty champagne glass. The ANZ headphones are not good. I'd advise travelers to bring their own headphones. There's a jack to plug them into so that you can listen to the inflight entertainment, and both a USB charging port and a 110v outlet for your own devices. As I found on my previous long-haul ANZ flight on the same aircraft type, there appears to be a heat source under the seat. After a short time lying in the bed it becomes sweltering hot. I found the bed itself, under the mattress, to be warm. Very uncomfortable when used as a bed. The plane has large windows but they are behind you, so looking out of them requires turning your head more than 90 degrees. The view out the window would be better than the view of the feet and unclad legs of the person across the aisle, who's wearing shorts and went to bed shortly after takeoff, before dinner. Food is delicious and plentiful. Snacks are available any time. Overall, ANZâ€™s service is excellent, both on the ground and on the plane. The crew was marvelous. The aircraft is new and modern. But the seat layout and design, the lack of storage space both in the overhead and around the seat, and the temperature of the bed leaves much to be desired. As a result, Iâ€™m not sure the additional cost of a business-class ticket is worth the money.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Auckland to Houston,November 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,yes

Qatar Airways,5.0,S Sutton,29th October 2013,We flew recently from London to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia via Doha. The entire trip (to and from) consisted of four 7-hour flights with approximately 2-4 hours stopover at Doha Airport. While we do not have any major complaints Qatar Airways in our opinion do not deserve a 5* airline rating for economy class. The cleanliness of the plane left a lot to be desired. On all four legs of the journey scraps of litter could be seen near the window seats. Food remnants were found on the fold-down table and on the cushion supplied. We were generally satisfied in terms of the level of service food entertainment and the comfort of seat.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,E Sauerwein,8th April 2014,I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Cabin crew could do with a communication refresher course: on the outbound they were welcoming and friendly, but on the inbound they were devoid of smiles, mechanical with military-like efficiency, and I witnessed some shocking behaviour from one crew member who barked at passengers, even shouting ""chicken or lamb?"" six times to an elderly passenger who clearly could not undertand English.

Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience.

I flew economy for the first time in a while after previously flying business and was so disappointed with the level of customer service. I felt almost inferior. I guess you get what you pay for. From lack of healthy snacks between meals, to not being able to get a bottle of water (because they are for service - even though I ended up drinking the same amount of water every time I got up to look for some). I was so disappointed and am currently dreading my return trip. I might change airlines after this.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,L Iakovidi,6th April 2015,Economy Nice CÃ´te d'Azur to JFK 4th April 2015. Flight was about an hour delayed to leave Nice airport but Delta gave all passengers complimentary pizza and drinks as an apology for the wait (even though I had received an email about the delay several hours before). Boarding took forever as the mandatory checks have become very long and tedious (my carry on bags were opened for a second time right before I boarded the plane although this was randomized from what I understand). The plane floors and loos were quite dirty as if a thorough cleaning had not been done in a while. Very limited food choices although staff helpful with snacks.

United Airlines,5.0,C Landrehth,2nd April 2014,I recently flew First Class on United # 15 from Newark to Honolulu. This is a 10+ hour non stop flight. The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland. My advice to people traveling on United is to bring your own food even in First Class!,,,First Class,,,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,,3.0,no

After waiting for at least an hour, the agent told me the bags were in Turkey and that they would be delivered sometime in the next 2 days. Iâ€™m lucky I had some spare clothes in my carry-on. I called Turkish everyday ever since and just yesterday (July 4th) they told me they basically have no idea where my 2 suitcases are. All agents are very unhelpful and have no idea what is going on. I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didnâ€™t even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things.

Air Canada,5.0,C Lassara,6th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Rome. The Air Canada staff at the Toronto Airport were very friendly, professional and very competent. It was very easy to check in and get loaded on the aircraft. Unfortunately things started going downhill after that. The aircraft was freezing cold. They had the a/c on high for some unknown reason. Even after many people complained, one of the cabin crew claimed they turned up the temperature by a couple of degrees. It was still as cold. Everyone was glad to get off the plane in the morning and warm up. Air Canada staff in Rome are rude, impatient, unfriendly and incompetent at best. They act like you are bothering them at the check in counter and after our flight home was cancelled, you cannot make up just how incompetently they mishandled the situation. I'm not talking about just 1 person. It was pretty much all of them. Their communication was awful as to getting our bags back. The passengers were basically left to fend for themselves to find their bags since we were all sent to the wrong turnstile. Then Air Canada sent someone with the voice of a mouse to give instructions on who goes to what hotel. This almost turned into a riot since almost no one could hear or understand. The employee seemed to have no idea what she was doing and gave terrible instructions as to which hotels and where to find the shuttle buses. There was no organization whatsoever from the Air Canada staff. It really was the incompetent leading the incapable. It took the airport police who were wonderful to get us to the hotel. Air Canada could care less. The next morning, we were right back to the rude, impatient treatment at the check in counter with a different person and disorganizion at the gate since we had to be bused to the plane. Everyone was thrilled to get away from the Air Canada Rome staff once they were on the plane. We must give credit to the cabin crew however for the return flight. Although this aircraft was almost as cold, the staff couldn't do enough for everyone. They were kind and professional. The wonderful Air Canada staff in Toronto guided us to Customs and we got all our bags.

Fortunately a sympathetic passenger finally offered to move to allow my wife to sit with our son.

American Airlines,1.0,Iain Lawrie,16th October 2015,"Don't fly with American Airlines! Having booked our business class flight with British Airways we had to use American Airlines from LAX to Honolulu. We had a 6 hour wait in LAX for our ongoing flight so decided to use the American Airlines lounge. Fat chance! We were refused entry as we weren't members! Even after explaining that we were flying business class we were told we were not allowed in. Having flown all round the world over the last 20 years many times in business class, we have always had access to lounges. Not according to the American Airlines agent! So after biting our tongues, we eventually got onto the flight to Hawaii. What fun. The cabin service manager was rude and obnoxious. The food was the worst we have ever had, even flying economy. Even telling the Cabin Manager about the food, all she did was pick up the tray and make no comment. There was a young Hawaiian hostess who was sweet and smiled at everyone. So what was the problem with her boss? The seats were uncomfortable even though they were supposedly First Class. We had made the mistake of having front row 1D and 1F and we were so close to the bulkhead we couldn't stretch our legs. Don't have bulkhead seats! Return flight to LAX we changed our seats to non bulkhead which helped with the legroom. Went into the AA lounge in LAX and were greeted nicely and given access. We then asked why we were refused entry before, only to be told that it was a mistake as we had the right to use the lounge! We should have asked to see a supervisor to check our status! Pity they put untrained staff in a business lounge. Having got entry into a lovely quiet and spacious lounge we were disappointed to find a total lack of food except to crackers and cheese. We had been given 3 drink vouchers each so we could get something to drink. Why is it that other airlines give you no restriction on drinks? The next flight was from LAX to LHR on a new Boeing 787. Nice plane and nice business class seats.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,S Neuhauser,12th September 2014,"Travelled VIE-IST-JFK-IST-Vie at the end of July. We booked Premium Economy with TK to N.Y. for a family trip as TK offers best value in this class (only slightly more expensive than the cramped Y-class on any direct flight from Vienna to N.Y. in peak season unfortunately there is no Premium-Y ex Vienna). 3 days befor departure we received note from TK that due to an aircraft switch ""Comfort Class"" (only on TK's 777) would not be available on the 10-hour flight from IST to JFK thus we were offered a later flight. I requested an update to C-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from TK and just what I expected from ""Europe's best airline""! Our 2-hour morning flight to IST in Y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served (fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering). Our connecting flight was in C-class so we enjoyed the marvellous TK lounge at IST airport that streches over 5000 square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed Turkish Coffee! The flight to JFK on an Airbus A-330 in business class was as comfortable as it can get (welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds Do&Co flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling FAs a wide range of movies). Bottomline: we arrived relaxed and happy. Only a minor point: cabin design could be slightly more colourful. Unfortunately our flight back to Vienna via IST was not upgraded so we travelled in ""Comfort Class"" as planned. Seats are in CC are wide and legroom is plenty. There were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind C-Class (keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight!) but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying. The amenity bag distributed in ""Comfort Class"" wasn't Porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy. At IST we spent some time at the ""Prime Class Lounge"" (we pre-booked this service before we departed) where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight. The final leg of our journey took us back to Vienna in Y-class in the late afternoon. Again menu cards with an extra drink/wine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by TK considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on 2 hour flights.

I booked a paid first class seat for myself and then a day before my trip my son decided he wanted to come with me, so I paid for him to travel along side. I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin. As it was a short flight I ended up downgrading myself also as my son is only 8. Eventually I got a decent credit with Delta, but was pretty mad about their process as it simply makes no sense to downgrade a paid customer and enforce a 2nd paid customer to also downgrade themselves.",MD88,Family Leisure,First Class,BHM to ATL,November 2015,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Alitalia is really a budget airline these days - simple food, no inflight entertainment on flights under 4hrs. At Rome, both the LHR and Cairo flights had to take buses from the terminal rather than use sky bridges. Pretty surprising given it is their home airport.

American Airlines,1.0,C Gipson,22nd August 2016,"The trip started in Orlando for our 7.45pm Aug 13th flight to Santa Cruz Bolivia (AA313). After 5 gate changes and an hour-ish delay we finally boarded. We then sat on the tarmac for another hour while ground crew loaded baggage. We finally take off and arrive in Miami expecting to have to have someone at American Airlines find us another flight to Santa Cruz. But, the flight to La Paz/Santa Cruz had been delayed also. We ran and made that plane only to sit on the Tarmac in Miami for another hour plus (the other passengers had been waiting much longer than that). Finally we took off for La Paz where we were to remain on the plane for our continuing flight to Santa Cruz. We waited, and waited and after around 2 hours the captain informed us that the crew had passed it's legal time and was deplaning. So we deplaned and went through customs. Finally we arrived at the AA counter where we stood another 2 hours in line only to be given an 80.00 bolivian voucher for breakfast which didn't come close to paying for anything to eat but we appreciated the effort. AA apparently was not able to complete its obligation to get us to our destination so they put us on a BOA plane and got us to Santa Cruz after another nearly 6 hour wait. The last part may not come as a surprise but for good measure the luggage was still sitting in Miami when we arrived in Santa Cruz.

It had a small amount of different positions and there was no really ""lounge"" position. I am of very average size and weight and I wonder how large people could squeeze in. I asked the staff for a different seat and was told they were all the same. In fact I was flying the newest business Class seat in the latest Boeing 787 of Air New Zealand.

American Airlines,7.0,S Johnson,12th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | The aircraft appeared new, at least on the inside and was very clean. The flight was on time. We were given a pad to spread over the seat for sleeping along with the customary blanket and pillow. The seating is in the 1-2-1 configuration with the same controls and hardware that our Cathay Pacific flight had on the first leg of this trip (Los Angeles - Hong Kong), my wife and I had the two center seats. The business section began with row 4. We had access to Cathay Pacific's Bridge Lounge prior to the flight which was comfortable. It was a night flight (leaving at 7.40pm) so we were served dinner soon after lift-off. The meal was average, with a first course that was inedible (grilled cheese served ice cold and so dry it was difficult to cut or chew). I didn't see anyone eat that course-I wonder if AA gets any feedback on food selections that don't get eaten? The second course, scallops for us, was good enough to eat although nothing to look forward to. The flight crew was spotty in that some were attentive and efficient (in my wife's row) and some were harried, inefficient, and surly (my row). On the whole, the crew was nowhere as good and nice as those in the other airlines we flew this trip, which were all Asian airlines so perhaps it's not a fair comparison. Unfortunately, we had flown Cathay Pacific on the flight over to Asia which is a tough airline to compare to in regards to service although frankly any Asian airline we have flown has better flight crews (more service oriented and nicer) than American Airlines' crews. The Captain was informative as we waited to take off, which was nice. The entertainment options didn't include any recent quality movies although some quality older movies were offered (like ""Casablanca""). The crew didn't bother to ask passengers to open windows when we landed in LAX which made landing a bit less comfortable. All in all we were happily surprised with the seats and aircraft but suffered through the kind of service that is characteristic of AA in our experience. This plane did offer wifi although business passengers had to pay for it ($12 for 2 hours was the shortest plan). It took so long to pull up the wifi plan options I figured the service would be to slow and didn't buy it. Apparently AA sees wifi as an additional revenue opportunity rather than a way to enhance business class and make it more competitive with other airlines. We had flown AA on a similar flight returning from Asia a few years ago and it seemed to us that AA is trying to improve their business class and it is better than it was then. Unfortunately for AA in that market the Asia carriers are often as good as it gets in terms of flight crew service which continues to be AA's weak suit.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Hong Kong to Los Angeles,December 2017,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Yoko Takemura,2nd February 2016,"Air Canada's service was, from beginning to end, appalling. On the flight from Tokyo Haneda to NYC via Toronto one of the flight attendants treated passengers as if they were inferior to her. Before takeoff she ordered passengers to close their overhead compartment (isn't this her responsibility?). At one point, there was a lady with a crying baby. This flight attendant told her to put her two large bags up in the compartment in a rude and apathetic manner. The lady was too short to do so, and she was alone, so she had to get a tall passenger next to her to do it for her. On another occasion, she came over and reached over to turn off my reading light without any warning, which I was using to do my knitting. As she reached over, she spilt water on my boyfriend's leg, she apologised and said ""give it 2 minutes and it'll dry."" The two male flight attendants were also rude - when handing out inflight meals, they would stare in silence when passengers were trying to decide what meal to pick and when collecting trays they would just hold out their hands, expecting passengers to hand over your tray as well as other passengers if they were sleeping. On the ground, before take off I politely asked an Air Canada staff member if my boyfriend and I could sit next to each other since our seats were one in front of the other. He seemed overly confident that it was possible and told me he would call my name out. I waited until the last minute, after people started boarding, for him to call my name to find out that he found an aisle seat 9 rows away with no change to the other middle seat we initially had. I understand an aisle seat is great when traveling alone, but this was the opposite of what we wanted - we were now 9 rows away. I told him that that's not what we want, and immediately he snapped, took back the flight ticket, and said, ""if you're not going to appreciate this change I'm giving you back your old seats."" To add, the inflight vegetarian meals were awful, if at all edible. Leg space is really limited compared to Air Canada's smaller, older planes.

QR had me overnighting in hotel to take direct flight DOH-DUB next day, however after much debate with ground team they put me on another flight to LHR 6 hours later, which that ended up delayed, would have missed connecting flight to DUB so full circle and I went to hotel and took direct flight next day. Transfers all arranged and voucher for meals, can't fault the disruption service. Service on MEL -DOH was average, no interaction from the male FA. Service can border on robotic, very impersonal. Seat comfortable, like the lounge behind business class, great place to stretch out. I found the cabin too hot,Wifi very slow and patchy, the free MB goes in seconds. Flexible airfare so premium price paid. QR still far superior to majority of other airlines, just need to improve the ground staff support, will continue to fly with them.",A380 QR905 9feb,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Melbourne to Dublin via Doha,February 2018,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,yes
Air New Zealand,1.0,Romeo Liebig,6th July 2014,I recently took Air New Zealand to Sydney as part of a ticket with connections to a Vietnam Airlines Flight. Arrived early at Auckland Airport checked in with a customer service staff as their cost cutting exercise with no check in counters means that the check in kiosk does not work for when taking connecting flights and having to check your bags through. Arrived early at the gate ready to board at 6.15 am only to board 10 minutes prior to departure meaning we departed late as they have just one staff in charge of the boarding process. When on board felt like a sardine especially with the larger man in front of me with the seat bending back badly. Aircraft certainly ageing and seat very hard and uncomfortable. Food and drink okay but very basic. Entertainment outdated as well was watching something had already seen before. The Air New Zealand staff very casual and not really smiling at all and don't really care about the passengers as long as they are being paid. Can not recommend taking Air New Zealand again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Stephen Rhee,23rd April 2019,"Not Verified | Chicago to Phoenix. I am an Exec Platinum on American after recently switching from United (work reasons). I booked my family in first class (paid revenue seats) and fully expected them to enjoy their experience coming home from spring break. It was completely the opposite. My wife had to fly back with two of my three kids while I flew back with my other daughter because of high school sports. My wife and two other kids were flying back in First class. Checked in, and 10 minutes before boarding the gate agent proceeded to tell my wife the kids lost their first class seats and were being moved to coach, and couldnt be seated together. WTF. We paid for first class seats, they allege there was an equipment change, but only 2 people were moved out of first class (my kids). My two kids and separated from their mother on the plane. They are minors. In addition, they did this 10 minutes before boarding! They offered a refund of the difference in fair (130 dollars) and a 300 dollar voucher. This is completely unacceptable. And you know who sat in the two seats that were taken from my kids? two other kids. American could have handled this with some class 1. offered another flight in first class 2. offer a voucher that covers enough for two tickets in first class 3. rebook us on another airline in first class or rebook the other family on one of the above options 4. offer miles deposited to cover a first class ticket I am going back to United. I spend between 20-40k a year on travel and have never had this issue with United. I float between 1k and global services on united and will never spend a dime on American EVER AGAIN. F-them.

Good safety demonstration video, and a smooth, on-time flight with good information from the crew. My bags needed to be re-checked at Cathay Pacific due to their flight being the following day, but LAX staff took a while to send them to the carousel. The only things I missed in-flight were a foot/leg rest in the seat, and the lack of a GIS flight map on the TV monitors. Overall, I was very satisfied with this flight.

But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city.

I had a reservation for 5.40 pm flight to Atlanta on Aug 17 that was delayed by 3 hours - reason given was â€œlate inbound crew â€œ.After 3 hours of waiting, the flight was announced cancelled now the reason given was bad weather. The weather was fantastic here and in Atlanta from 5pm -9pm. So I donâ€™t get it. I was going for an important medical two day training course which was starting Aug 18 at 8am to 5.30 pm . So I had to get there in time. They were able to pt me on the next flight which was supposed to depart at 9.36pm but after waiting on plane for 3 hours that was announced as cancelled too due to the thunderstorm. Funny part is we waited on flight for close to 4 hours and the storm now had passed but they could not fly as crew had timed out! I luckily hD no checked in baggage but the folks who did were asked to come back next day at 6 am to pick it up. They were not ready to give out baggage to passengers for whom flying the next day was not an option... again because their crew had gone home. It almost felt like their crew had to rush home once the clock struck a certain hour otherwise they would turn into pumpkins like in the Cinderella story! Then one of their crew members has the audacity to talk to all the stranded passengers badly - He tells us , ""this happens. Crew has gone home, we are humans not machines, we need to go home too!

We're not dealing with any more of you."" Made it to the next gate and had to convince that attendant just to check and see if I'd make a 10pm connection. Her answer was ""no"" and she seemed to think her job was complete. Waiting on hold and in lines for hours just to be told I won't make it home. No effort whatsoever to actually rebook or solve the problem.

Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why?

Jetblue Airways,2.0,C Nguyen,24th June 2012,Our family waited in line for 2 hours then found out that our flight was cancelled only by asking them. Afterwards we waited in line for another 2 hours to check if we can get in another flight since we had a cruise waiting for us. After we got to the check-in counter they said they were sorry and couldn't get us another flight and that many others who were going to our cruise couldn't make it either because the airport in Florida was closed. We knew this was untrue because our other family from another city had a flight to Florida the same time we did and they were able to check in and everything. After about 30 minutes of trying to negotiate with them we decided to get a refund. Being disappointed we called in to the cruise company and told them about our situation the next day.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Rob Bowden,6th July 2015,"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only Â£925 each when it was over Â£1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,A du Plessis,7th January 2016,"Birmingham to Johannesburg via Istanbul return. My wife and I fly from Birmingham to South Africa with our 3 year old daughter quite frequently using Swiss, Lufthansa, KLM, Air France and Emirates. On this occasion we decided to try Turkish Airlines and while the service was okay in flight, we were shocked and disappointed with the complete chaos and lack of organisation we experienced from Turkish Airlines employees at Ataturk airport in the face of adverse weather conditions. After a 3 hour delay at Johannesburg airport, we arrived too late at Istanbul airport to catch our connecting flight to Birmingham and Ataturk airport was utter chaos and disorganisation. We were sent from one very long queue to another â€“ standing for hours with a 3 year old child after a long international flight â€“ no water was supplied or even available, no hospitality of any kind â€“ just chaos and more chaos.

Alitalia,9.0,S Delrio,6th September 2014,I've being flying Alitalia for the last few years back and forth between Milan Linate and Sardinia (Cagliari or Alghero). In four years (and 80+ flights) it occurred only once that my flight was 1-hour delayed. Planes used by Alitalia for my short route were usually Airbus A319/A320 with spacious seats and entertainment system (only radio). I never had problems with the luggage (1 hand-luggage and 1 32kg check-in bag is included in the price). Personnel was always nice to me. Some things can still be improved but I think Alitalia is still the best that Italy can offer.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,yes

It was not possible to receive my wheelchair in Doha. I had to use an airport wheelchair which was too small. The transfer to my seat was also not very professional with their right equipment. On the way back in BKK I didn't get the confirmed seat. I got a seat (43D A380) with unmoveable armrests and it was difficult to sit down.

Lufthansa,9.0,Arthur Mosher,4th March 2015,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,9.0,Tianhao Xu,14th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Lvov to Johannesburg via Istanbul. The first leg was flown by a A321. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The plane seemed to be pretty old, with an old school PTV - there is PTV, but it's not touchscreen nor anything on demand, you could only choose from the few existing channels. Since it's a flight less than 2 hours so it's not a big problem. A excellent light meal was served. I had a long layout in Istanbul so I left the airport for a while. Istanbul airport was a bit crowded, that's why the new airport is opening soon. The next flight, IST-JNB, is on a A333. The food was also good - probably the best food I've ever had in economy, but there's only one option if you didn't book special meal, so it might be a problem with some people. The seat pitch wasn't very good for a long haul flight but still acceptable. Amenities were good.

We had a nightmare of a time getting to Fort Lauderdale from Madison. Initially the our flight was delayed 30 minutes for bad weather. We were not upset about that. However, once all the passengers were boarded, we were asked to unload because of a mechanical sensor issue which took another 2 hours to fix. We ended up having to stand in long lines and rebook our connection 3 different time. All in all an 8 hour delay! When we finally got back on that flight, the pilot says they have to fuel up!! They couldn't have done that when they were fixing the sensor?!?! If that whole situation wasn't unfortunate enough, we got bumped from our original return flight and are now getting home over 5 hours later than we wanted to. When we asked about getting on an earlier flight, we were told no and each customer service person we spoke to was unaccomodating and rude.",,Business,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Chicago via Madison,February 2019,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no

It was a while ago flying a long haul flight with KLM and I was a bit concerned after many good flights with Singapore Airlines in recent years. But I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, service was much better than my last KLM long haul flight to Dar es Salaam. The crew were friendly and pretty attentive. Secondly, the food was tasty. It started with dinner (evening flight), finished with cheese quiche and ice cream in between. No problem to get more food if you left hungry and ask for. Enough drinks including wine, beer etc. Last but not least, the aircraft and IFE. For an 8 hour flight the seat width and pitch are reasonable. The electronic dimmable shades do work, mood lighting is nice and cabin noise is relatively low. In my opinion the biggest advantage of the 787 is the increased humidity compared to older aircraft. Nice IFE touch screen. However, if you look at the details my previous A350 flights with Singapore Airlines scored better on almost every aspect. KLM 787-9 is lacking a separate IFE control unit (for people who like gaming) and the screen is not adjustable, there could be more lavatories and it would be better if it had manual shades. Also the A350 cabin is a little bit wider. It would be nice if KLM replace their plastic cutlery for metal and replace the paper hot towels for cotton. The efficiency of meal service could be better as well (it was not very organised). Overall I was satisfied.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Toronto,June 2017,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Seating arrangement on the Dreamliner economy class were 3x3x3 found it inconvenient for couples especially seating by the windows. Seating space were just okay for small built any taller than 1.75m might be a tight squeeze. Our inbound transit at Hamad Doha were from remote parking bay.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Michael Chen,4th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Singapore to New York JFK return via Doha. I have flown this route 3 times in the last 8 months with 3 different carriers. My favorite is Qatar Airways. The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags. Some of the cabin crew looked rather new on the job but it was clear that they all worked hard to accommodate everyone's requests.

The FA that looked after our section of the cabin was disengaged and uninterested. Lunch and breakfast were mediocre and the mid-flight snacks were simply abysmal. Wine selection was limited and labels available were well below what a business class offering should be. Part way through the flight I enquired if the aircraft was equipped to offer espresso coffees. The FA said it was but they were never supplied with the pods and that UA was planning to rip them out.

Aegean Airlines,6.0,S Nalloucas,28th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | This review is about the Miles & Bonus Scheme. Aegean are focusing on their in-flight quality of service which is indeed very good. On the other hand their prices can be high even for short distance flights and their Miles & Bonus scheme is a joke. Although I have accumulated a great deal of spending miles, it seems I cannot spend any since in order to find free slots, I have to foresee a trip many months before and it has to not fall within their busy periods, making it pretty impossible to spend them. Even if you want to use the miles to fly 2-3 months ahead, you have to be willing to fly with other star alliance carriers and through other destinations (transit), hence doubling your flight time and hassle. I am a silver card holder (need one more flight to become gold), and I am entitled to 2 upgrades per year from economy to business class. Whenever I try to use these upgrades there never seem to be any available slots/seats. Then a year passes and these vouchers expire. The new trend is to put you on a waiting list and if the flight doesn't get full on that day, then they might upgrade you, but you can't know before the actual day of the trip.",,Business,Business Class,Athens to London,January 2019,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,yes
American Airlines,10.0,R Paterson,2nd August 2014,JFK-LAX return in F on the new A321 transcon product. American has really upped their game here. The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent.

Flying from or into Punta Cana, this means that we had many hours without food and with very little to drink as one is not allowed to pack anything to bring through TSA. To compound that when the Manchester flight was canceled due to fog we were left with no time to get any food either.

I'm a frequent traveler (usually every other week on CX or MY) I only choose Emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an A380 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. We had seats 52H/J/K next to the galley, to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. Firstly, the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you, they don't use a curtain. Even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise, lots of noise, if it's not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors it's the cabin crew talking. Meals were low grade and poor quality. Meal service took forever and was completely unorganized, my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later I was offered a regular meal. Condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats - the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets. ICE system is good, but the headphones are a perfect example of form over function - who has square ears?

Their website and mobile app are an atrocity then again the flights were absolutely fine. The 15+ years old B777s with refurbished 3-3-3 cabins are way more spacious than many of the newer planes though 31"" seat pitch in coach feels borderline cramped. IFE screens are tiny but the AVOD selection is downright impressive. Unlike previous trips the staff were courteous attentive and efficient.

Air New Zealand,2.0,Brian Kindlon,2nd August 2014,NZ-2 LAX-LHR. Worst airline selection I have ever made. I should have gone with either Virgin Atlantic or BA. The economy section in the 777-300 is a complete joke. I know Air New Zealand is making extra money by having 10 seats across in economy but at what cost? I will never fly with them again and I am sure many other passengers who experience this economy section feel the same way. I really felt like a sardine packed in a can in that airplane. To make matters worse there was no individual airflow control. The plane was hot the whole flight to the point you were sweating in your seat. The only positive was that I had a friendly flight attendant who gave me free drinks towards the end of the flight because she felt so bad for the people on the plane.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,K Leng,21st February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasnâ€™t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasnâ€™t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, Iâ€™ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything thatâ€™s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlinesâ€™ fault and that they didnâ€™t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. Iâ€™ve tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time Iâ€™ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me theyâ€™ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but itâ€™s been 2 months now and I havenâ€™t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didnâ€™t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that theyâ€™ll fully refund me, but arenâ€™t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what Iâ€™ve been through. Itâ€™s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews).

Air Canada,2.0,Gordon Nettleton,3rd May 2014,"This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the ""pods"" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities.

I have written to them twice now to protest their terrible baggage policies that encourage people to game the system and bring large heavy luggage to the gate so that they can get it on for free rather than paying for checking. This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger's backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured.

Air Canada,6.0,O Rubenstein,12th April 2015,YUL-YYZ-HKG-YYZ-YUL A320/B777. Typical of AC flights were late or delayed despite the weather being ok. Outbound YYZ-HKG flight had obnoxious disappearing FAs combined with a malfunctioning IFE. F&B was nothing special but edible. An average flight. Return HKG-YYZ-YUL flights were distinguished by the worst departure and arrival delays of all the flights and terrible catering. The J class main meal of beef was overcooked and inedible as it was so tough. Breakfast highlight was dried out croissants and a glop of salty greasy noodles. FAs on this segment were professional efficient and polite. AC's IFE featuring small screens with poor resolution has a limited library of interesting titles. It remained closed for most of my flights unlike my flights on CX or BR which offer current films along with an interesting selection of Asian films. AC's international films have a lot of Bollywood and are of little interest to China/Japan route customers. I really look forward to the Asian film selection on AC's higher end competitor EVA. The AC IFE equipment is at least 5 years out of date along with the uncomfortable worn out pods. The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new blankets are a welcome change. The lavs were the usual basic AC setup so very different than those found on Asian carriers. Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual. Considering the fare paid which was higher than the AC competitors I don't think I received good value for my purchase.

Emirates,4.0,Piotr Wegrzyn,8th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I expected something more from Emirates. I've heard many pros about the airline from my friends who have flown with Emirates and an ex-Emirates stewardess. What I experienced, is the opposite of what they told me. They told me that the food is the best food you can eat in economy class. I have also read that the ICE intertainment system is the best IFE system in the world. I do not agree at all. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai, flight number EK 160. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. I was excited to try the ICE, so the first thing I did after I found my seat was to try the system. I was very disappointed when I realized, that the screen's temperature is over 40 degrees, and the touch works badly. The sound from the headphones was also very noisy, I think that DACs in the aircraft were maybe broken. I ordered Asian Vegetarian meal (AVML) on their website before the flight. Agian, I expected something more from a 4 star airline like Emirates. The food was just OK, nothing more than that. The next flight was from Dubai to Singapore with an A380, reg A6-EOT. The A380 was the best long haul plane I have flown with. There was a lot of legroom, and place next to the seat (I had a window seat) to leave small things like a pillow or your headsets. This time, the ICE worked well, and was more advanced than the old crap in the 777. Unfortunately, the cabin crew were rude and they didn't care about the passengers as much as the cabin crew in KLM or even AirAsia. I saw them only when twice when they gave food to the pax. On the way back to Oslo, I ordered Vegetarian meal. I was shocked, when they came with a Vegan meal. Is it so hard to see the difference? All other airlines offer vegeterian food or even lacto-ovo vegetarian etc. Also, I don't recommend the meal for those who are Vegans. It was really disgusting, and it was too warm. I will never recommend this airline to anybody. I could fly cheaper with airlines like Qatar Airways, LOT or Finnair, but I bought an Emirates ticket just for the A80.","Boeing 777L, A380-800",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Singapore via Dubai,April 2019,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Henry Reis,25th June 2018,"Vancouver to Montreal. This was my first time flying with a child. I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure 11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there. Now I had to call customer service and spend over one hour for them to guarantee us on the premium seats on our return flight, but I am still expecting a full refund for the premium seats I was denied despite having paid for them.",,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Montreal,June 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,1.0,Nicole Tenreiro,26th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Melbourne to Charlotte via Portland. I was scheduled to depart on 9/15/2018 from Melbourne Fl to Charlotte, NC then leaving from Charlotte, Nc to Portland Me. Unfortunately due to the tropical storm the flight was cancelled. I proceeded to call there 800 number as they instructed to find other arrangements. The agent sent me to Daytona Beach which is an hour and 30 mins away from Melbourne. I drove to the airport only to find out that the agent had booked me on a flight out of Dayton OH. Due to her lack of incompetence, I had driven to an airport that wasn't even flying to my destination. How do you make that mistake knowing I live in Fl and booked me a flight from OH. I called the 800 number again as Delta had a flight leaving from Daytona Beach to Atlanta and they could get me as close as Boston which my destination was Portland ME. Delta suggested that I contact AA and have them transfer my ticket to them. When I got a live agent on the phone they unfortunately could not do that for me as they were not transfering any flights for customers to other airlines. I had to end up paying for another ticket through Delta because of AA incompetents. I am thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied with how AA handled the situation. They only refunded me for the cancelled flight I originally bought from them and would not refund me for the inconvenience they caused me nor would they give me miles for there agents mistake. They told me that they are not responsible for me making the option of flying and buying another ticket through another airline. That they can only address to higher management about the agent that made the error. I will never fly with AA again. Delta will be my number 1 choice of airline as they went out of there way to make sure that I was able to get to my destination since I was in an airport that AA had me drive to where no flights were going out of that day.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Charlotte via Portland,September 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,3.0,no

Emirates,6.0,Froggett Jerry,4th June 2014,"LHR-DXB-LHR with Emirates both ways on A380. Aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the A380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. Managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. Unfortunately as I've always found with Emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. Bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. Sadly this comes with a built in 'chip on the shoulder' which I've seen on every Emirates flight (more than thirty) which I've taken over the past decade or so. Slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. On the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. Food nice and plenty of it. A request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a French stewardess: ""I have more than 500 passenger today so I get it when I can"". I replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. Needless to say my wine was forgotten and I helped myself from the galley instead. Another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. On the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. Not impressive. Sad really because the aircraft and the product is very good. Just delivered very poorly. My airline of choice is BA.",,,Economy Class,,,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,no

This was clearly an emergency and we had paperwork to substantiate our position. At the very least you could have waived the fees!! Anyway, we get to the airport and are waiting at the gate to be boarded. I've never seen such chaos!! Normally people are boarded from the back of the plane to the front, after boarding ""Priority"" passengers first. After calling for Priority passengers, the chaos began. They never called us by section and people were being boarded in a disorderly fashion. The best part was after half the people had boarded already they decided to stop the rest of us and have us check in our carry-on luggage if they had wheels on them. Who the heck has carry-on luggage without wheels these days? That added extra time and aggravation to this flight.

The wifi (paid service) was excellent and really helped to pass the time during the long 11-12hr flights. One passenger had an eating disorder and for some reason there had a misunderstanding and Lufthansa didn't have a meal for them. I was very impressed how the chief purser went out of her way for the passenger offering him food from business class and at one stage even her own food! The outbound flight was delayed due to a technical malfunction just as we were taxiing to the runway. However was impressed with how Lufthansa handled this.

To top it off they tell me they're not sure if they will be able to refund them. 5 days later after I called highly upset they magically get refunded back to me.

During the flight my in-flight system was not working and eventually I gave up. Furthermore on landing we were held on the tarmac without any update from the pilot and to compound a totally miserable flight the walkway was unable to be used due to power loss (not the fault of QA but added to the misery with pilots going into radio silence).

Air Canada,4.0,Tangye Graeme,17th September 2014,We had three short haul domestic flights with Air Canada - YVR to YYJ YYJ to YYC and YYC to YVR. One flight was on time one was 25 minutes late and the other was over an hour late. Minimal information was provided about the delays and most of that was obviously incorrect. Check-in at YYJ and YYC was simple and efficient but at YVR was terribly slow with only 2 bag drop desks open and huge queues. The overhead lockers on the YYC to YVR were inadequate leaving everyone a scamble to find space anywhere they could. I would give any other airline a try next time - Air Canada performance leaves much to be desired.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,no

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,7.0,J Weaver,6th February 2011,Kiev-Moscow-JFK. Experienced more of the same disorganization that I saw on my previous flights. I have found that flight attendants to not enforce the rules because they are half the size of their very pushy customers. Flight smooth except for passengers attempting to remove heavy bags and dragging every other object out of the overhead with it. Upon landing in JFK we were delayed getting to our gate. While we were stopped passengers got up and got their bags and raced for the exit. There was no effort made to stop them because of the size difference with the FA's. Plane was new and seats were reasonably comfortable. I feel sorry for Aeroflot staff having to deal with stubborn and highly combative passengers.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,M Hilton,26th January 2015,What can I say about long haul KLM? A true tale of extremes: Pros: Value for money (only Â£560 return ABZ-SIN via AMS). Lounge at AMS (free food drinks wifi and showers via Petroleum Card). Food and Beverage onboard was to a surprisingly good standard for economy airline food and freely available. Staff were attentive and helpful. Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world! IFE was so dated and a limited poor selection of music films and TV. Cabin decor is dull. All in all not too bad but the cons niggled away at me.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,5.0,yes

Sat down and watched TV. Then some people started standing up and getting upset flight now delayed until 11.45pm. Our plane arrived but had to wait on a crew to fly us. Finally got on the plane after midnight and waited another hour on the plane. We were told we might not have enough fuel. Really? The plane had been there at the airport for 3 hours and no one checked to refuel it? Got back to DFW at 2.30am. Only one baggage person there at that time and several bags were missing. 30 minutes waiting to get our bag that came in at an early flight.

All staff have been great - starting from check-in and all the way through until my arrival to EZE. Lounge at Auckland airport was very crowded, not easy to find a seat but managed. Variety of food and drinks was good but because it was so crowded, some trays had no food left. Onboard the plane, staff very caring and food and drinks good. I do have some ""nice"" complaints. The first one is the toilet area which is was small for business class. My second complaint is the amenity kit. I love Air New Zealand but on this issue you lost my vote. Just few things inside the amenity kit, I even asked the flight attendant if something was missing, he even replied that was not the first time they asked him just that.

On top of this they messed up on our return flight from Calgary. No premium economy available so we chose the front two seats in economy they changed the plane last May didn't tell us so we lost the seats after a few calls to the call centre in India they refunded the charge for the so called premium seats but it's not a money issue we wanted the seats. Arrive at the airport and now we have to pay $70 for our third case that was FOC on the way out. We explained we would have booked it if we could but no joy they charged us.

Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

About one hour before scheduled flight to LHR we had been informed about flight cancellation. This was just the begin of our horror trip .We spent almost six hours at DUS airport trying to rebook our flight. Customer service desk at the airport was rude and unwilling to help, so we had to rebook our flight to LAX on our own, via the Lufthansa call-centre. Unfortunately the first available flight was on the next day from FRA. Few words to the flight itself. I know flying economy class you can not expect too much. But the seat comfort and entertainment on Lufthansa A380 is in my opinion below average. Seats comparing to other airlines (KLM and Aeromexico) felt very cramped and uncomfortable and touchscreens unresponsive. The only positive aspect of the flight was the flight crew, which was very attentive. After coming back from our trip in September we claimed for compensation from Lufthansa for our cancelled flight and almost 30 hours delayed arrival in Los Angeles.

For the second delay, the passengers had actually completely boarded, and then we were told to disembark. When we finally got on the plane - three hours late, the pilot gave a very brief (and disingenuous) apology and then said, ""Well, it is what it is.""

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,Jayne Southwell,5th August 2015,"Flew World Business Class on outward flight and return from Amsterdam. There was a two hour delay, due to weather so not KLM's fault and the other due to toilets not working correctly which were thankfully fixed before departure. We were kept informed of the former delay via e-mail and a telephone call and as the plane boarded with a personal apology which was a nice approach. Service outbound was fantastic. Excellent food and choice of wines particulary the Dutch white, also the ruby port. The new flatbed seats I found spacious and speedily adjustable. The flight back was OK but lacked the personal and efficient element of outbound which is why I didn't give full marks. Staff friendly but I gained the impression staff just wanted passengers fed and watered as quickly as possible and many things were forgotten, from cognac to museli, everything was a rush. To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small. Didn't happen on European hopper flights however we flew economy as didn't see the point of an upgrade on a 45 min flight. Efficient, organised service from boarding to arrival.

Air New Zealand,4.0,V Priest,1st July 2018,"Not Verified | Cairns to Auckland. The flight itself on Air New Zealand was fine with a friendly cabin crew, but the problems we had with the airline was getting the flight to operate. Our flight was continuously delayed at CNS until they finally decided to cancel our flight to AKL due to crew rest hours. The cancellation announcement came 2.5 hours after we were supposed to originally take off. The passengers were told to meet at a gate and it was a 15 minute wait to have an employee direct everyone to baggage claim to reclaim their bags and find a service desk to help all the stranded passengers. When the service desk opened another 20 minutes later there was only one employee figuring out arrangements and accommodations for a full flight. We waited in the middle of the line and after another 2.5 hours of waiting in the service line the employee told the passengers still waiting to be helped that they could find their own accommodations and transportation and be reimbursed, or they could go home and meet at the airport at 5 am for the rescheduled flight at 8 am the next morning. The airline was having trouble finding hotels for all the passengers and wasted everyoneâ€™s time by not telling everyone that they could find their own accommodations and be reimbursed hours earlier. We have a future flight with Air New Zealand from AKL to SFO and we asked if we could be upgraded on that 14 hour flight to better seats instead of the airline finding us a hotel or reimbursing us, and we were rudely told that the airline doesnâ€™t do upgrades. The next morning we got to the airport as soon as the check in line opened and only one person was checking people in and helping people with their hotel reimbursements. We were also asked if we wanted a voucher for a complimentary breakfast instead of automatically being given the voucher. The airline didnâ€™t prepare hotels ahead of time if they planned on canceling the flight and they continually had only one person taking care of an entire flight at the service desk and check in.

Virgin America,1.0,Christine Kahler,1st April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | This was by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Virgin America cancelled my flight due to crew issues and did not provide a new itinerary. Rather they sent an email asking me to rebook my flight within two months so as not to incur fees. I proceeded to call them and spent four hours on the phone to get on a new flight. They confirmed me on several flights, I raced from terminal to terminal (mind you I'm pregnant) but because the supervisor took so long to confirm each flight I missed three flights in a row. I could have accomplished what they were trying to do (rebooking me through a flight on Kayak) in 5 minutes. Because they did end up rebooking me on a flight (which instead of being direct, flew through Boston and added 4 hours to my trip) they are not giving me a reimbursement, even though the supervisor on the phone promised to do so.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,Raymond Biller,23rd April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flying on Delta today has been one of the worst experiences I've had flying with any airline. My original departure for return started in Brunswick followed by a horrendous stop in Atlanta. Upon arrival at approx 230 pm I was directed to a boarding gate in terminal A gate 17. A short hour later they changed the gate to terminal A gate 31. A short hour later the flight was changed to terminal B gate 33. Keep in mind at no time was an announcement ever made for gate change, the unmanned tv screen just miraculously changed without notice. Just when we thought it was over and by we I mean the several passengers in wheelchairs, and those needing assistance to board, we're notified that 2 mins prior to boarding time they had changed gates again. This time we would have to run essentially to terminal E gate 35. Some arrived approx 10 mins after scheduled boarding including myself to be told that the flight will mow be pushed back because it flew in from Colombia and needed to be cleaned. I approached the gate representative and notified him that my next leg from Seattle was international and that the new arrival time only allows a 30 minute window between arrival time and actual departure of my next leg international to Victoria, Canada. The response I got was priceless and he typed my name into the computer to verify and suddenly looked up with a smile as he said I guess you should run when you get there! While I wanted to laugh I also realized it's probably not a good time as a rep to be making jokes to passengers who have been re-gated 4 times and may or may not make it home to their family on time or even the same day. Professionalism and some punctuality is important if you wish for customers to return and in this case as I heard from the crowd numerous times Delta lost many return customers to include myself.",,Business,Economy Class,Brunswick to Victoria via Atlanta / Seattle,April 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Paul Neelman,8th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didnâ€™t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,G Morton,1st January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dammam to Amsterdam. Watch out if you pay for an upgrade and are unlucky enough to either get downgraded or have a cancelled flights. You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told ""the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight"". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone ""It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class"". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. All in all KLM are not customer focused and are only focused on your money, making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. Whilst flying out of Dammam we have had our flight delayed (above flight) due to fog, we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information, hotel, transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. It took KLM 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport, and still we were not given any information. We were told by the KLM business lounge rep "" I will cancel your exit stamp and you can go and sort yourself out until the next flight"". And with that we were escorted through passport control which took 2 hours and dumped back in the departures area of the airport, landslide.",,Business,Business Class,Dammam to Amsterdam,December 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers - it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane.

Emirates,10.0,Rob Bowden,8th July 2015,"After several Economy and Business flights on Emirates we'd accrued enough Skywards points to upgrade our return flight to First class. Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class. This was 8 hours of pure luxury although I would never pay for it as it's double the price of Business class which is also excellent on the A380.","A380, Boeing 777-300",Couple Leisure,First Class,Hong Kong to Dubai,March 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

One month before departure Delta changed the itinerary in Milan-JFK-Minneapolis-Denver which was exactly what I was not looking for (2 stops rather than 1). Too late to change tickets because of high prices. From NY we took off more than 2 hours late most time spent inside a super hot aircraft on a taxiway and consequently we were not able to get the flight from Minneapolis to Denver. Rescheduled for the next day we were forced to spend the night in the airport because the customer service horrible was not able to find a room in Minneapolis.

Air New Zealand,2.0,T Raimiha,20th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | We were having vehicle problems and arrived to a small country airport called Kerikeri at 9.41am when the flight was 9.50am. Ordinarily, my understanding was that we had to be at the airport 30 minutes before. I paid for a full 23 kg baggage flight. At Kerikeri the attendant did not greet us. She just said you cant take the bag, you're too late, just take 7 kgs. I told her I was returning to Australia. Her attitude was brash, not helpful and she was not prepared to offer options for me after paying over $500 for the flight. She even smiled when she said sorry the bag can't go. In my mind, the bag could of been taken, thrown into the hold as people were still boarding, the plane had not turned on, the doors were still open. Kerikeri is a 'one horse airport' that if the lights turned out, there is nothing there. It has a plane come in 2 x in a day so extra service can be afforded. It is not like they are rushed off their feet. But this attitude seeps through all of Air New Zealand who provide the same type of basic people in Auckland domestic airport and I had the misfortune of this group in 5 May 2019 when no one helped to show me to my plane access. Didnt take my ticket. Just stood around and said nothing. I even almost missed my flight to Palmerston North because I couldnt understand the announcer who had a hick Pacific Island accent and could not pronounce 'flight boarding' let alone Palmerston North. Again in 18 March 2019 when the guy standing there and doing nothing, throws a ticket at my 67 year old sister because she turned up 20 minutes before their domestic flight which is stated on their ticket. He tells her that she should of been on the plane 20 minutes before throwing her ticket at her. She is running down the gang way towards her plane and the other staff stand there taking no notice that she needed help Air New Zealand are shoddy, backward group whose attitude on the ground has to come from an ingrained shoddy management culture and that should be changed.

Check in at T4 quick with seats honoured was able to use the sky team lounge through my FFP status - nice lounge. Boarding the new A380 was quick and organised seated upper deck I was impressed by the space seat and general ambience the best economy I've travelled in. Take off on time a very nice crew kept busy! Drinks and dinner offered. Dinner just ok connection in Doha went fine. Flights between DOH - CPT and return on new 787's I found the 787 noisy and not as comfortable as the A380 both flights on time again pretty good service from nice crews although food not that good. Had a longer connection in Doha on the return trip so gave me a chance to experience the new airport and business lounge which were very nice. Doha back to LHR on an ageing A340-600 which I found comfortable for the 6hr 20min flight!! crew fine food not that good however for the price paid I really cant complain some of the best economy flights I've had I'm looking forward to using Qatar business in around 2 months.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,yes
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,Humble Jackson,28th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Atlanta to Lagos via Amsterdam. Issue started from ATL airport. My flight was originally meant to leave at about 8:25 pm today but because they overbooked people on this flight they downgraded me to economy class without my knowledge. I complained to the agent about my seat not being what I booked and paid for. They made me leave that airplane to sort out the issue all by myself. I spoke to one of the KLM agents and showed her my itinerary at the airport gate - who told me they were overbooked while another agent rebooked me on a business seat on another flight leaving tonight at 10:30pm after so much confusion and frustration. I called the customer service number and the Lady was nice but on getting to the lady supervisor on the phone with a three way call, she was rude, insensitive, inhumane to my plight for help after I and my wife explained the situation to her. All she kept saying was my flight was not confirmed and she can not help me even after the gate KLM agent told me it was due to overbooked flight. She went on to say the flight the KLM airport agent gave me would not work because she can not see it on the computer and she refused to talk to the airport agent at any time to resolve the issue after explaining to her the need to...so they could discuss their findings on their individual klm computers. My question to KLM corporate is why do some KLM clients have to go through so much stress and why did they choose me to be downgraded, inconvenienced and embarrassed? I would have appreciated if someone explained to me honestly what was going on instead of some KLM staff especially the supervisor being so so so nonchalant about the situation. However, I would like to commend the last KLM customer service rep my wife spoke to tonight on the phone. He was empathetic and understanding. I am really disappointed with the lady supervisor who did not make any attempt to understand the issue, not to talk about even resolving the issue. I am really disappointed with KLM as a whole and some agents do need to be retrained in dealing with issues at hand. I sincerely hope corporate will look into this matter and find ways to resolve issues like this and more. Overall, my experience today has been my teacher. I will seriously give it a deep thought before booking another flight on KLM for my future travels.",,Business,Business Class,Atlanta to Lagos via Amsterdam,December 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

One time on my way back from a vacation from Hawaii Delta changed the connecting flight from the Las Vegas Airport to an earlier time. I was not informed until I arrived in Las Vegas only to find out that our connecting flight had already departed. The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm. Since that phone call the flight has been further delayed three-times. Delta is the worst airline I have ever flown on hands-down with extremely poor customer service.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,7.0,A Aweidah,31st March 2014,AMM-DOH-AMM in economy both ways on 777 ER 300. Plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me (I am 6 ft 2). Inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. The only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. The buses to the plane in Doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. The new Hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. The price was cheap I would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out Emirates or Etihad any day.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,S Andrews,6th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own. No free internet in SAW, and the procedure for getting the paid one is crazily complicated. The flight from SAW to AYT was uneventful too, a brand-new B737-800 with a great entertainment system and a good sandwich",,,,,,,,,,,,
American Airlines,1.0,Terrence Cheng,9th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Our flight was canceled because of snow-fine, no one can control the weather. The issue is in what happened after our flight was canceled. We were rebooked on a flight for the next morning, that would have taken us from NY to Boston, and then to Miami - a total of about 6 hours travel the next day. I called the 800# for AA to talk to someone about rebooking for something, anything that would get us into Miami that day, so we would not have to waste 2 entire days of our 5 day break (while also wasting hotel nights, and other things we'd planned). When I spoke to the person on the 800# she told me that there were no more flights leaving JFK, Newark, or LaGuardia, going to Miami that day. And maybe this was true for direct flights. I asked if there were any other options whatsoever, with flights going elsewhere that might then connect to Miami that day. She told me there were no other options. I asked, point blank, ""So you're telling me that no more flights are arriving in Miami for American Airlines for the rest of the day?"" She told me the only option was for this flight we had been rebooked. I then went to a counter to try to get on a standby list for an AA flight that was full, and going to Miami. Seeing a growing line of upset people, the attendant at the counter actually made an announcement that he could not help anyone who had been booked for the 6.45 canceled flight. I spoke to him anyway. I, again, asked if there were any options at all that would get us to Miami via American. He told me he was just too busy to help me. I'd like you to meditate on this for a moment: an AA service representative told me that he was too busy to help me, a customer whose paid flight on American Airlines for himself and his family to go away for spring break had just been canceled. We went to another AA gate for a later Miami flight to try to get on the standby list. At this gate we spoke to a gentleman. He was very pleasant, added us to the standby list, and then we sat. A few minutes later, he me up to the counter and said he could get us on a flight to Chicago, and from there we could pick up a flight to Miami. I was somewhat incredulous after a) being told that there were no options by the AA ""service"" rep on the phone, and b) being told that by another AA ""service"" rep that he was ""too busy"" to help me. So I asked him to confirm that we would have guaranteed seats to Chicago, and then to Miami. He said yes, and that we'd get in around 9pm. It worked-we made it to Chicago, then Miami, and ultimately only lost 1 day, arriving at our hotel in Miami almost exactly 12 hours late. But we did not lose a hotel night, and we did not have to reschedule anything else. This man saved our vacation. The rest of the AA staff and system is rigid, inflexible, and robotic, and do not try to help customers. They seem perfectly okay with unhappy, sad, disappointed and angry customers. Maybe they see it all the time and are numb to it. Maybe they need better training, maybe they take too much garbage from some customers who no doubt act like jerks. We did not act like jerks because we respect people trying to do their jobs. But we don't respect organizations that foster a culture where most staff clearly don't care about customers and only do the bare minimum for their jobs.

I thought it was a very personal touch and made him feel special. Both flights were pleasant, the aircraft clean and we even arrived a little early on both flights.

A had a stop over in Dubai, and I had a confirmation email from Emirates and a print out from the Emirates counter in Sydney while I did my check-in. A chauffeur was booked to pick me and my daughter up and we had a hotel room booked complimentary from Emirates. When we arrived in Dubai, no one from Emirates helped me to find my chauffeur. I went to the Emirates counter and the person who was really unhelpful, cancelled my booking without asking me anything and was very rude! I had to wait for hours at the airport with my 17 months daughter. I was expecting much more from the business class from Emirates. The cabin crew during the flights was average. While my daughter was sleeping I asked one one of the crew to look after her while I was in the bathroom. She showed me that she was really annoyed to help me, she finally decided to stay as I asked her if I could get someone else to help me if she didn't want to do it. The cabin crew was eating food in front of clients and was not in a hurry to help clients. I sent a complain on the Emirates website and they answered that it will take up to 30 days before I hear from them - this unacceptable. The business class is expensive enough to deserve the treatment that goes with it.

United Airlines,1.0,D Edwards,18th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Absolute worst airline I've ever flown with. I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate. Absolute swindle. You buy a cheap flight because you can afford it, but then you have to pay extra for something every other basic airline ticket allows you to have. If I can possibly avoid it, I will never fly with them again.",CRJ-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to San Diego,January 2018,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,3.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,Dan Grew,8th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I am a fairly regular and satisfied user of KLM in Business Class, albeit normally long haul. On this occasion it was a relatively short flight from Amsterdam to Malaga with my family. Check in was speedy but no notification was given that there was an aircraft type and configuration change (already known at check-in by the way). Consequently it came as a surprise when we boarded to find that some of us had been re-assigned. One could argue that we should have checked our seat assignments at check in. My excuse is that I have never experienced an unannounced seat re-allocation in all the 20 years or so I have travelled with KLM. Advance warning of the fact would have been welcomed. Lounge was adequate. Boarding procedure reasonably adequate. Comfort factor in Business Class was no more than one can expect on European flights these days! Cabin crew friendly but lacked concentration. In a cabin of 11 passengers the Purser somehow managed to forget to serve both my wife's and my meal. These things can happen, although one can question why in such a small cabin. If we were not regulars on KLM it could have left a very poor impression of the airline to a newcomer.

Air Canada,8.0,J Keep,26th August 2014,We flew LHR-Toronto outbound via Halifax and return via Montreal. Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious. Overall we were pleasantly surprised.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,yes
Emirates,1.0,Starr Lowie,12th February 2014,DMM-DXB and DXB-LAX. DMM-LAX: flight attendants look as if they don't want to be there delayed flight due to late turn around of the plane. A general sense of being disorganized. Good: ICE system and fruit meal for an hour flight. DXB airport is too crowded just too many people. DXB-LAX: full flight with very little service throughout. Only one drinks service call light largely ignored. Food was poor and service was an eternity only one full meal. Snacks were not served. Seats are uncomfortable. Good: few FAs were attentive toilets were clean and ICE system was good. Overall: not a good flight. I'm not looking forward to my return flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,no

As a Star Gold, I used the business class check-in, which was friendly and efficient. Boarding was punctual and disciplined, but we all ended up on the same bus. Onboard, I had a window seat in a row to myself. Breakfast service was prompt. The meal was tasty and LH offers sparkling wine even in economy. We departed and arrived on-time, and luggage was waiting when we cleared immigration. The most impressive feature of the flight was the onboard entertainment streamed to the passenger's own ipad.

United Airlines,9.0,J Willis,18th March 2014,UA28 9/3/14. Noticed online that aircraft had been changed from 777 to a 767-400 which wasn't an issue as the 400s have AVOD entertainment similar to 777 and are far superior in comfort than the older 767-300. The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more. I only purchased one alcoholic drink on this flight as united charge $7 for a beer which in my view is a bit steep for a long haul flight but typical of an American carrier. Having flown with united before I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed and most importantly I got from a to b at a reasonable price.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,D Braning,21st August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Denver to Cozumel via Dallas with American Airlines. The outbound flight was canceled via text message at midnight, 9 hours before the scheduled departure with the excuse given that AA had no staffing for that flight and rescheduled us for the following day (36 hours later). After a heated discussion with their customer service I was told there were no other flights available. My 15 year old daughter found another flight within 2 minutes using her cell phone. I checked the flight online and discovered that there were 8 available seats. Another phone call back to AA. I presented our case and managed to get us on a new flight that left 4 hours earlier than our original. We grabbed our bags (1:15am) and rushed to the airport. The remainder of that day was uneventful. Fast forward 8 days later after an incredible stay in Cozumel, we land in Dallas for our connection to Denver. We waited 2.5 hours at the gate. AA informs us of a 15 min delay, then a 30 min delay, then a 45 min delay. Finally a gate attendant announces that the plane is on the ground and that they need to deplane, clean up a bit and then we will be on our way. 5 minutes later we see the gate monitor change from an 11pm departure time to a 6am (the following day). This was followed by an announcement the the crew had ""timed out"" and the flight had been canceled. No apologies, no attempt to rebook flights. The gate closed and we were left sitting there. My family and I spent 7 hours trying to sleep on the airport floor waiting for the next flight. We boarded the following morning and finally made it back to Denver. I will never fly AA again.

Air Canada,4.0,T Eldem,10th January 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Munich to Toronto with Air Canada. We were met by the AC Concierge and promptly processed through the check-in formalities. The flight was delayed by a full hour due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort. The FA's were all very nice and worked hard throughout the flight. The in flight service director on the other hand was smug and very condescending. Food was OK for Economy but portions were very small. IFE was descent but music selection remains obscure.

Both legs of the journey had short change over times and both times the flight was delayed, meaning a stressful sprint across one side of the terminal to another. Onboard, there were plenty of drinks being offered and the cabin crew were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were the hard, flat seats and the boring entertainment options (only 3 Korean movies were offered even though 95% of the passengers were Korean. I noticed others were bored too).

I checked into my flight 1 hour prior to takeoff as I had multiple connecting flights, first one was domestic to Colorado. The airport is a small local regional airport that decided to schedule 3 flights within a 20 min period with 1 line of TSA agents checking people in. Needless to say, United airlines left 20+ passengers behind on a flight with 50 seats total. American Airlines also had 2 flights taking off within this period but delayed the flights to ensure that all their passengers made it onto their flights.

Was assured from the aircrew that Air Canada ground crew were aware of the delay and arrangements had been made to fly Toronto passengers out on two flights. All we had to do was contact the AC agents at Montreal. Suffice to say no one was available to help in fact a less helpful bunch of individuals I have yet to meet. After lots of chasing around from one departure gate to another I was eventually put on a flight to Toronto Pearson which resulted in my sister having to dash across Toronto at the last minute. Furthermore it seems my luggage arrived on an earlier flight isn't that a security breach?

Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha.

I scheduled my flight allowing for a 2 hour layover since Dallas airport is known for delays. My flight from Dulles was delayed 45 minutes due to a circuit board issue. Once we finally arrived at Dallas, we had to wait around 30 minutes on the runway because there was a plane at our terminal. Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldnâ€™t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying â€œwe donâ€™t have all the time in the world to help people that arenâ€™t on this flightâ€. Again, that flight didnâ€™t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance.

I have you on a new flight, have a nice dayâ€. Iâ€™m happy the gentleman was more â€œwelcomingâ€ than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company.

Lufthansa,10.0,Claus Madsen,20th September 2015,"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansaâ€™s new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansaâ€™s ambition is to become Europeâ€™s first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care â€“ and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best Iâ€™ve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (â€˜lie-flatâ€™) seats have been described by others. Since Iâ€™ve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these â€˜newâ€™ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow â€“ perhaps too narrow for comfort â€“ and I donâ€™t really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldnâ€™t close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (Iâ€™ve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the worldâ€™s biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly. But itâ€™s a detail that in no way spoils the general impression and, indeed, five-star experience.",A380,Business,Business Class,BLL to LAX via FRA,August 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes
Aegean Airlines,2.0,Jerry Kell,17th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Skiathos via Athens to fly in June 2018. A text from them told me they cancelled our flights due to 'Operational Requirements' 6 weeks before our holiday and to ring them. They offered night flights several days later or to travel 5.5 hours to fly from Heathrow. Work, Pre-booked Trains. hotels and ferries meant we had to travel on that day from Manchester as Heathrow was Â£300 more for us to get there at short notice. At no point were they going to meet extra travel costs or compensate the 4 of us in any way other than refund our flights which we have had to do. Why they didn't provide a coach to transport people from Manchester - Heathrow I don't know and the unsympathetic attitude to our prearranged details astounded us. The result is we are flying with an alternative airline at a cost of Â£500 more per couple. Customer Services are next to useless and online only as there's nobody you can talk to in person. I'm still awaiting my refund which they say will take 10-15 working days. Today it's come to our attention that they're operating a flight out of Manchester on the morning our flight was due to depart via Brussels which would get us to Athens at a similar time to what we should have arrived. Upon bringing this to their attention and asking why we weren't offered this option they say they use Aegean Flights only in these situations. The first leg was operated by Brussels Airlines and the second part being Aegean themselves. They sell the flights, there was room on the flights yet we were not offered the option of them even though it would've been the easy alternative. It's the last time we'll fly with them.

Cold, rubbery chicken-ish thigh meat with stale cold rolls. Broken inflight entertainment at several passengers seats nearby including mine. Flight attendant barred passengers from using a bathroom directly in the cabin due to no apparent reason other than wanting her own privacy in the area between 1st class and premium. She forced passengers to 'go to the back of the plane' where lines and economy passengers were already overwhelming capacity of the available 2 commodes. Transit in Canadas major cities in my back/forth experience added agitation and chaos and was remarkably coldly delivered.

Lufthansa,10.0,M Benson,15th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | It was the first flight of the day from Porto to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Ground staff was very helpful replying to all my questions and forwarding my bags to my final destination and were very polite and efficient. After which Lufthansa was kind enough to provide me a nice selection of electronic reading material for my trip, which was a nice touch. Boarding was fast and efficient and the plane departed on time. It was a very clean and new looking plane, with comfortable seats and we were lucky to get the new inflight entertainment system where with your mobile phone you could download the Lufthansa app and connect to the airplane's inflight wi-fi system to stream music, videos or just see the flight progress. Very nice touch for a short/medium flight, which generally don't provide any kind of entertainment whatsoever. Cabin crew was nice and polite as always and served us a simple, yet very tasty breakfast, with a very nice sandwich made of rye bread. The flight was pleasant, quiet and with no turbulence. Arriving at Frankfurt the staff was more than helpful in directing us to the boarding gates to our connection flight - transfer process was fast, simple and quiet.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,OPO to FRA,July 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,J Baron,11th May 2015,UA 937 I had not flown in a 767 in a long time and I travel a lot. The plane was old and dirty and the flight attendants were old and fat. They never smiled or greeted you - clearly hate their jobs. The announcements were like the ones you hear in school. Don't do this don't do that - militant. I had booked a Swiss flight I thought. The inflight entertainment and food were very poor compared to other airlines. No water bottles given out just cups. Cheap. The toilets were smelly and there was no amenity kit you see in other airlines.

Southwest Airlines,2.0,S Baker,18th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Las Vegas to Kansas City. Another flight at night time, another 2 plus hours delay. They just apologize like itâ€™s no big deal, the problem is when you travel as often as I do you can see how often these flights are delayed. Especially the last one going from Vegas to Kansas City Airport. Anyone can look up this information but just in case youâ€™re wondering, tonightâ€™s flight is WN5915, 03/17/18. Also when the plane did arrive, it arrived at the wrong gate which led to further delays and if you were using your Southwest app as your boarding pass, you probably lost your boarding pass since the app thought the flight had already departed (you canâ€™t make this stuff up), meaning you would need a paper boarding pass and leave your A spot! Addendum: they had a bad exit sign which meant clearing the passengers out and doing paperwork to fix it, which has led to another 20 min more delay.

American Airlines,10.0,M Irving,12th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | First time I have flown with American Airlines as I usually fly United to the US. Flew from London Heathrow to Chicago ORD. Fare was on offer so I flew American Business class to the US and British Airways First Class back to the UK. Checking in - Heathrow airport I arrived at 05.30, the check in desks did not open until 06.00 for an 08.40 flight. I was aware of the desk opening times so waiting was not a problem. There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered. As I was flying business class I was informed that I could use the fast track security lane and make use of the American Airlines lounge. Boarding as with all major airlines boarding was the usual, Family's with children, Passengers that require help / more time followed by business class. On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones. Great choice of films & TV on the tablet only minor niggle is that the tablet is taken back about an hour before landing so a bit annoying if you are halfway through a decent film, also I am not sure how passengers who do not use tablets would of managed. Seat - I found the seat comfortable enough, plenty of leg room. As this was a morning flight I did not feel the need to make use of the lie flat feature so I cannot comment. The seat is controlled via a touch panel and it seems a bit sensitive as while resting my arm on the side the seat started to change position, I did this a couple of times until I placed something over the panel to prevent me from altering my seat layout accidently. I was seated in 4A a window seat. Landing luggage was through fairly quickly again no issues were encountered.

The line was extremely long and it took me 1.5 hours to get checked in. I discussed my issues with one of the employees and told him I am not happy with the service. His response was very poor and he seemed to not understand the issue. On the flight to Delhi, we requested an Asian meal but they denied to gave us an Asian meal on the flight, which I found very strange. After reaching Dubai, the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. I asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was ""SSSS"", which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously.

It was much more than we were expecting. I was in the same row of a particularly tall man and he was able to stretch and cross his legs comfortably. It was certainly helpful with storing our bags and stretching out. The crew cabin were professional and helpful and the food was nice if a bit stingy on the olives in the Greek salad (just one!). What the flight needed was an option for some decent IFE as all we got was a travelogue of Greece which made us sadder as we loved Crete and we didn't want to leave!

Air Canada,4.0,S Paice,4th September 2013,LHR-Toronto-LHR. Day flight from Heathrow wasn't too bad. Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC. Luggage showed up though and we arrived in once piece and on time so a couple of marks gained there.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no

Qatar Airways,9.0,Alan Wan,24th February 2015,Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival. The hotel had arranged for a fixer to collect me and deliver me to the car pick up point where the hotel mini-van was there to collect me.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

United Airlines,8.0,Paul Mercer,27th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew United from London Heathrow to San Francisco. Check-in was sluggish largely because passengers in front were attempting to travel with massively overweight bags. But once they were gone it went smoothly. Heathrow security was, unusually, working quickly and the staff were even smiling. Unfortunately there was a 15 minute walk to the gate. Boarding was a little confused having been selected for an extra TSA check. This meant that I circumnavigated the ticket process. They then asked why I was on the aircraft. It also seemed slightly pointless because they swabbed one of my laptops without noticing that I was carrying two. Iâ€™m totally in favour of tight security but this exercise seemed counterproductive. Boarding was otherwise very efficient. It was a new aircraft â€“ very clean and everything was working. A good selection of movies and an easy-to-understand IFE. I like the Boeing 787. The lighting is perfect, air conditioning pleasant and ample overhead locker space. I usually travel business and was not looking forward to travelling at the very back of the aircraft but I was pleasantly surprised. The cabin crew were excellent â€“ friendly, funny and assiduous in their duties. There was no problem with asking for more wine and the food was delicious. Another pleasant surprise was the lack of annoying announcements â€“ a lesson some Middle East airlines could learn. The flight left on time and arrived early. Given how cheap the ticket was, it is difficult to find anything at fault with this flight.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Roxana Stan,6th January 2016,"Bucharest to Abuja via Istanbul, and the nightmare started when I arrived to Abuja Airport from Istanbul on 11th December on a Turkish Airlines flight. Both of my luggage never came with the flight. Apparently, after some days they sent one of the bags to Kano (another airport in Nigeria) and from there to Abuja. So I got that one. I've never seen the second one. I made complaints and called them and it's been almost one month since I came to the country and I still didn't get it. All my clothes and belongings are inside that bag since it's the big one. I was supposed to travel the same day of the arrival to Calabar, however because I didn't have my bags I had to spend more than one week in the hotel. After that time I got tired so I decided to travel to my destination. They said when the bag is found they'll send it to my address - that's what they say. This is the worst experience I've had. The worst thing is that I have a return ticket.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,OTP to ABV via IST,December 2015,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Alitalia,1.0,Tara Willetts,11th January 2015,Saga began when I tried to book a seat several weeks prior to boarding. I went to the website and tried to follow the instructions but was unable to reserve a seat. Despite several attempts to do this over the next few days it would not work so I decided to go to the airport extra early (5 hours in advance of my flight). There were no aisle seats left despite me being so early so I decided to go ahead and book a â€œcomfortâ€ seat for which I was charged an additional 85 euros. Onboard I get to my â€œcomfortâ€ seat which is the aisle seat at the front right beside the washrooms. The aisle where everyone crosses in front of you. The man sitting beside me had also paid extra. His seat was ripped and the stuffing was coming out. He moved to the next seat over. Meanwhile people who had not paid the extra asked if they could sit in the other comfort seats (including the two by the window on each side which were much nicer and also vacant) and told that they could. We paid they did not they got better seats than we did. As we were taking off the air hostess told me to put my seat to the upright position I was surprised because I had not put it back. A few minutes later she told me the same thing. Thatâ€™s when I realized the back of my seat was broken. The man behind me was unhappy with this and spent the entire flight pushing on my back in an effort to keep my seat more upright. It would stay for a while and then a passenger would walk past and push on the back of my seat for stability and back it would go. The man would push me forward someone else would push me back - this went on for 9 hours. One of the bathrooms went out of order (the bathrooms beside my seat). The staff did not put an out of order sign on the door. They knew it was out of order because I told them. People kept lining up. I would tell them it was out of order. They would walk to the other bathroom on the aisle in front of me. I would pull my feet up to let them pass - one more strike against my â€œcomfortâ€ seat. The man next to me was trying to work - every time someone walked past they hit his computer. He was very tall and got tripped over and bumped through the entire flight. The other bathroom at the front of the plane was put out of order. They ran out of toilet paper. I chose to avoid drinking for 9 hours so I could avoid the bathrooms. The plane was so old and decrepit. I fly several times a year for both business and pleasure. This was easily the worse flight I have ever been on.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,7.0,MJ Jitesh,14th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew with Turkish Airlines from London Heathrow to Seoul via Istanbul on the 28th of June. During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention. Overall their in-flight service is very good, food is top notch, however, their ground staff could do with more training in customer management.",A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to ICN via IST,July 2016,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,yes

(Someone next to us had to pay for their carry on as well and were not happy). My sister's monitor for the entertainment system did not work. I don't want to put every employee of this airline in the same pot but the ones at our gate were not professional and my sister and I heard them laughing at us while we headed down to the plane.

Following morning flight did not board at 8am and was continued to be delayed and told only after the boarding times came and went. Again Delta was not straight forward with the fact that numerous other flights were before ours and they knew the entire time our flight was never going to board at 8am.

Originally there was supposed to be a hour overlay between my flights. When I landed they told me my flight was cancelled and that is was rebooked for the next morning. The email did not tell me why it was cancelled and I asked the customer service why and they could not tell and me and to just get a hotel room and submit the bill online to be reimbursed for the expenses. Submit it and they tell me it is not covered because the flight was cancelled due to weather. I understand it is not covered because it says it on their site but why would they not tell me this before I went to the hotel? Now I am out the $180 for the hotel and $200 on the flight that could have cancelled and got a rental car that would have costed me $60 instead because that customer service rep and the airport didn't tell me why it was cancelled.,E190,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Johns to Sarnia via Toronto,August 2017,3.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,1.0,no

The seats Dublin - JFK were old angled seats, fine for daytime flight but I wouldn't like to travel overnight with these. The full flat seats between JFK and LAX on the new A321 were superb. The old recliner seats LAX-HNL-LAX flights were nothing to write home about but a step up from shorter haul business class in Europe. only thing that could have improved for me would be handheld IFE units given out to customers in First Class on LAX-HNL legs.

United Airlines,4.0,Epstein Dominique,28th January 2015,Flight 914 from CDG to MCI with connection at Washington Dulles on Jan 14 in Economy class. The product featured by United is sub-standard. Of course ageing aircraft in the main leg (767) is clean and well maintained and this is the minimum you can expect from one of the largest airlines in the world. Check-in boarding operations baggage everything ok. Seats are standard. VOD is poor with very limited options and not user friendly. The music program was out of order for this flight and films not plenty. Besides on individual screens maps are not detailed and this system is less advanced than 20 years ago (I am not joking) in Asian companies. Also flight information is given exclusively in feet inches miles just if the metric system does not exist in the rest of the world! Regarding meals they are almost edible. We had chicken with some sauce (more sweet than sour) a large salad with a too smallish cup of dressing (good) and a kind of sponge cake pompously christened crumble â€“ wrapped in a cello paper printed European quality but made in Alabama. All in a very small slippy tray complimented with picnic cutlery (100% plastic). And of course passengers have to pay 7.99 $ for one beer. Ridiculous. By the way a sandwich (not bad) was served before landing but do not expect more than water between meal and snack. Fruit juices ice creams and other open bar is a dream out of reach at United. Attitude of cabin crew very professional (attendants have apparently about 20/25 years experience) working efficiently but not cheerful (friendly skies really?) in very bland uniforms which could be copied from Railways of the 70â€™ Being familiar with Asian and Middle East airlines I find United well below what you may expect from such a large corporation.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,no

Turkish Airlines,10.0,J Stein,24th September 2014,"I read some variable reviews before booking my flights from NJ to Istanbul so decided against direct flight and booked United to Munich then TA to Istanbul then TA back to Frankfurt and Lufthansa back to NJ. TA was by far the best parts of the trip with over-the-top service plenty of stretch room in business class (I'm 6'1"") and solid quality food. I liked the repeated options to grab another croissant / roll or requests whether I wanted a refill of wine or coffee. The Airbus A330s I flew were new and immaculate. My only complaint was the boarding process which wasn't well organized in Munich at all with a long narrow gate where everyone across all classes congregated and blocked any chance for an organized boarding. Had I not been near the front I would have been one of the last to board despite my business class seat and never heard a call for that class to board. The return trip was a bit better with the gate agent asking out loud - not over the PA - whether anyone was in business class and directed us to a separate line that was initially hidden from view.

Once on the aircraft we had been split up so cabin crew tried to sort this out but a very large person who had booked the seat insisted having it. It was sorted in the end but took a long time. As for the seats they where like rocks to sit on for any time. I was amazed that the cabins have large screen that keep coming on and off telling us here we are.

My last trip was uneventful. I was able to purchase comfort seats online, I was able to do mobile check in via app, mobile boarding passes worked, and I had no delay at any point at all airports of my travel. Check in desks in Kiev and Dusseldorf are well staffed and provide a very smooth and competent treatment. Onboard it was all right. Clean cabins, clean toilets, cheerful staff and smart snack concept including bar service. Somehow there was no battle over overhead luggage space despite full flights. Flights out were bang on time.

Announcements onboard about connection gates and delays are much appreciated.

American Airlines,6.0,Garrett Cimms,6th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | A red-eye flight from Las Vegas to Philadelphia with American Airlines. Flight was fully booked. All overhead storage was full, well before half the plane boarded. Our boarding group wasn't even called yet before they announced storage was full. This did cause boarding to take a lot longer than normal, as many people had to back track to check their bag with the front desk. The front desk continuously announced you could check your bag for free at the desk, due to the storage shortage, but it appeared most who were boarding ignored this. We gladly took them up on it, and dropped off our bags at the desk, well before everyone else finally realized they had no choice. This at least let us board quicker as everyone was now crowding the front desk. Desk crew was friendly enough, I think they were getting a bit annoyed despite multiple announcements that there would be no storage, that people were generally ignoring their calls. We flew economy, so seats were as expected. I'm quite tall, as is my wife, so it can be a bit uncomfortable with the small leg room after an hour or two. Knees not in the seat, but, not enough room to move them at all. So, if you are in the plus 6 foot range, and with a bad knee, can be a bit annoying, but, we realize you get what you pay for. Crew were friendly and pleasant enough, flight was mostly quite as it was leaving Vegas at 11pm and landing in Philly at 6. Napped most of the way, when I could, so nothing really to report. Flight was generally smooth and we arrived earlier than scheduled, so that's always nice. I only had a glass of water during the flight, so can't really comment on food/drink service, too much. I believe the Wifi on this flight however did not work. Disembarking was only troubled by other passengers. A middle-aged man near the back of the plane decided, rather than wait for the rows to ahead to disembark, he would just start pushing his way out, which caused people to get chippy.

To be treated like the way I was came as a complete shocker since never ever been treated like this prior to this unworthy experience. I had arrived from my flight from Taipei (Flight EK367) and was connecting Nairobi via this flight. I had 4 hours and proceeded to shop at Duty free as mentioned above has been my trend. I had checked in one luggage of 23KG in Taipei.I shopped for Chocolates. Upon heading to the boarding gate, I was stopped by an Emirates staff who demanded I weigh my luggage before boarding. I was irritated as I noticed other passengers boarding without being stopped to and they had more luggage. I assume this must be a routine check. My boarding luggage was 4KG excess. This was understandable considering the duty free items bought. I requested the lady to consider as I had only checked in one luggage and if need be, they check in my luggage. The lady suggested I speak to the gentleman. The gentleman would not hear of it! He was rude and started telling me if I want to complain, I can do that but I have to pay the excess! My luggage cannot be checked in! Since time was running out, I proceeded to pay for the excess luggage of 4KG. Upon waiting to issue my boarding pass, two gentlemen in front of me who were boarding had more luggage and the ladies (Different completely from the one who requested to check) told the gentlemen that they would check in their luggage without even checking how many luggage they originally had checked in! How unfair! When I started to complain, I was told time is running out and should proceed for the aircraft.

Southwest Airlines,2.0,Ross Macpherson,15th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Los Angeles via Denver. Just beware of Southwest Airlines â€œBusiness selectâ€. When you use the word â€œBusinessâ€ in relation to air travel, it usually means: a wider seat, more legroom, better meal service, prioritised baggage and lounge access. If you tick the box and pay for this so called upgrade you get none of those things. Fair enough, you have some fare flexibility and the bags go free. Apart from that and a free drink coupon, you get an economy seat and economy treatment. You get to board early.

However, this is the second time in two months my luggage has been damaged.

Today, 3 weeks later the new luggage I purchased was damaged (handle and wheels). Now, I canâ€™t wheel it straight or get the handle to come up. When I brought it to the service counter I was told that Southwest does nothing for handles and wheels. Meaning, my brand new bag has been ruined and Iâ€™m stuck with nothing.

Alitalia,2.0,Anne Fabierkiewicz,23rd July 2015,"My flight and subsequent experience with Alitalia, was the worst I have had. The flight attendants were rude, they forgot to give me a meal and when reminded, in a polite way, they didn't ever produce a meal. Luckily it was an overnight flight so not essential. On arrival in Rome, this was a direct flight, my luggage was lost / delayed. I spent a week in Tuscany minus any change of clothing, trying to locate the luggage by phoning frequently (several Italian speaking friends also helped me by trying to connect with customer service), to no avail. I was in a remote area, so could not even shop for essentials. When someone finally answered the phone they had no knowledge as to where my suitcase was. At the end of the week, after a spoiled vacation, I still encountered difficulties at the Rome airport. I was sent from one terminal to another, by very disinterested staff. in order to reunite with my luggage.

The planes seem to be maintained well and bathrooms and seating areas are clean. Service is pleasant and professional without trying to be cute during announcements. The food to me just seems to be a little better the service a bit more professional and the areas cleaner than everyone else.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8.0,A Zalewski,13th June 2015,"This was my first experience with Aeroflot and I was pleasantly surprised with the airline. In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers.

Alitalia,6.0,Alan Tang,25th November 2014,KL3401/AZ0107 (AMS-FCO): I bought the ticket via KLM website as they are both members of Skyteam. The aircraft was an A320 which looks ageing on the seats and cabin layout. Service was very basic with the selection of salty snack or sweet snack and the choices of drinks were very little (arancia rossa/orange juice hot tea hot coffee or water/sparkling water). Crew were not very welcoming and seemed not to enjoy their job I also did notice that the crew did not pay attention carefully to passengers who have not opened the windows shades and fastened the seat belt before landing. In a sum Alitalia is not up to standard of premium airlines that they claim to be. Many rooms for improvements in order to compete with other regional airlines. On the bright side the landing was very smooth and we arrived earlier as expected arrival time.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no

After a mediocre Business class flight to Turkey with them, we decided to stay at Economy for our flight back. The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESB-IST flight which over-hastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. IST-AMS service was alright, although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere, only getting worse. Also, the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible - barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of low-cost carriers.

I volunteered, but it took the Lufthansa staff at the gate a long time to decide that it was not possible for me to change the flight and this marred the boarding process. The service was not good for Lufthansa. For example, one half of the section of the plane where I was sitting (at the back) received meal menus, but not the other half. The meals were reasonable, but the seat was narrow and the meal trays so small that it was difficult for me to eat without spilling anything. And the staff kept bumping the meal trolleys against my elbows as they passed. The plane was one of Lufthansa's new 747s and I expected the seats to be wider and more comfortable. The other segments of the flight were better. The flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt was very smooth and the cabin crew combined great efficiency with being pleasant also. The cabin crew on the Tokyo flight seemed less efficient and depended where you were seated. The flight from Haneda to Hiroshima was a 787 operated by ANA.

Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, we found ourselves sitting in middle seats in different rows. I explained that my wife was pregnant with morning sickness and it would be great if they could at least switch her to a seat in the aisle. But both the girl at check-in and the guy at the gate said they had no seats for us to change to and that we couldn't upgrade. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""sucks for us, but if they have a full plane then there's nothing they can do about it."" The really upsetting thing is that after boarding we saw that there were many seats open just a few rows in front and behind us. Luckily there was a couple sitting next to us that had been similarly split up and we ended up switching with them so we could both sit with our spouses. I don't know what the deal with Delta seat selection is, but given that they couldn't even accommodate my pregnant wife when there were so many empty seats made this our last Delta flight ever. P.S.

We ended up buying new tickets on a JetBlue flight 6 hrs later but that flight after being delayed 3 or 4 times was also cancelled - due to there not being a pilot or co-pilot available! That was 6 hrs after the scheduled departure time! We found a JetBlue flight that had a few unoccupied seats and a sympathetic agent got clearance to allow us to swap our second ticket for that flight. That one agent was the only helpful person we encountered at Jet Blue. We still do not have our luggage which was set ticketed for the cancelled flight. There was no time to retrieve it and still board the alternative flight we identified.,,,,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,no

Southwest Airlines,8.0,D Shaw,12th June 2013,I had a connection in ATL on my way to BWI after taxiing out we went back to the gate with mechanical issues. The de-icer warning light came on. They told us we would have to wait for the plane to be fixed as there were no available planes after de-boarding they said they had found another plane for us. It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best. The crew etc were fine no issues there. The only thing I can say and it might be too critical is I would have expected them to be more proactive about reimbursing for the inconvenience.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes
Jetblue Airways,4.0,D Gargano,10th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York to Las Vegas. We were to fly out of New York May 5th, but they canceled our flight. I understand weather and such, but delay it would have been better. I called customer service to the tune of I am sorry, nothing we can do. We had a show that was paid for months ago and important to get to Las Vegas before 8pm. They could only get us on a 6-7pm flight which put us into LV after the show had started. Considering airlines were flying out in the afternoon, when the weather was better, JetBlue could not even accommodate by adding a flight that would have helped many of us who had to scramble for another airline. Every airline we checked was full or flying out in the evening. You could imagine how upset I was. JetBlue has a high cancellation record and I have been flying with them since the beginning. Dealing with TV's that haven't worked to sometimes unfriendly crew members, I brushed it off. When customer service on the phone says this has happened to them and they didn't take it out on the person trying to help them, after asking them how would they feel if this happen to them? That was wrong. Flying home on JetBlue was terrible. Full flight and the TV's did not work. It was a new plane and they did not work. Crew was not that friendly, empty cups and soda bottles were left under the seats. I feel like they have overgrown. No regard for the inconvenience of their passengers who have to shell out hundreds more dollars for a flight with another carrier or who miss important events. If you cancel a flight, figure out rescheduling a little later. That is the right thing to do. Put another airplane into use with a crew. I will tell you, we flew out on Delta and I was very impressed. I have 2 more trips on JetBlue coming up and then I think I need to part ways. I felt at their mercy like they shrugged their shoulders. I have choices and they should understand that. Sometimes the lower fare is not the best choice. I have written them many times on their great service and flights. Now I can't say that. They price gauge for everything from seating room, $70 for more legroom and the seats are not much more comfortable. At least on Delta, seats are wider and more comfortable for an up charge. This put us out almost $500 that we did not expect to spend. Everyone has their opinion and experience with each airline. JetBlue is getting a thumbs down for the added stress it put on my short weekend in Vegas.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Las Vegas,2017-05-01 00:00:00,2.0,2.0,,1.0,4.0,3.0,no

Lufthansa,6.0,N Barraci,14th February 2014,LH418 FRA-IAD 8 Feb. It was a rather comfortable flight in a not too fully booked Economy Class cabin. My major issue with this flight was about the internet connectivity on board. Unfortunately again FlyNet did not work at all. It has become a rather unreliable service over the last few months. Seating comfort on the new 747-8 is rather good nevertheless when someone sits next to you in Economy it is really a challenge to survive a long-haul flight. The distance to the front seat could be improved but most likely will not. Again I have to point out that as a Lufthansa status customer (Frequent Traveller Star Alliance Silver) I am being treated better by United (complimentary upgrade to Economy plus priority boarding priority luggage) than by Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Aleksander Saeth,30th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Oslo to Dhaka via Istanbul return. I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only). Turkish would rather exploit it's customers. The irony is that this very trip was the one that earned me the last points for a membership upgrade.

Flight delays are badly communicated (both to and from Dubai) and service is really poor. 2-2,5 hrs after take off you get served while having waited at the gate for 2 hrs (1,5 hrs delay) Cart is sitting in the aisle for 1,5 hrs before they start using it. No glass of water offered and on a six hour night flight you donâ€™t wait for over two hours to serve drinks or meals. Crew not unfriendly but for far friendly. If I can avoid I wonâ€™t fly again.

After some conversation with the maintenance crew at the airport the captain announced that they will have to deplane us. My thoughts at that point were - why wasn't it looked at before the previous crew left the aircraft? Or afterwards? They kept intermittently announcing that the flight would take off now and then and so on. But eventually 6 hours after we first boarded the plane the flight was cancelled. The crew expressed helplessness - we can't blame them.

This airline is usually the most expensive option in Mexico, but this time to my surprise it was the cheapest for most of the routes I travelled. They used to be a most punctual airline (it was even their slogan for years). Well, that's all in the past. 8 out of 10 flights were delayed. The minimum delay was 30 minutes and there I went to almost 5 hours (for one hour flights!). Their apology always came with the same excuse: Mexico City's airport is overcrowded, and its control tower keeps asking us to delay our flights. I would believe this if other airlines had the same problem. They don't. Flights going from the same airports to Mexico City, at the same time but with other airlines, were all on time, which of course was even more frustrating.

Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight.

I was primarily hoping for 2 things 1). On time flight 2). Safe arrival of luggage. The flight from Amsterdam airport to Moscow (2 hours time) didn't had inflight entertainment. The other flight from Moscow to New Delhi (6 hours 20 minutes duration) had good inflight entertainment system. The quality of food was OK was not at its best. There were no delays in the connecting flights. I had to board from Terminal E to Terminal F which was nearby some 700 meters walking distance. However there were some issues with Moscow Airport - i). To my wonder the security staff was missing and the passengers had to wait for odd 20 minutes. They came scanned the handbags and put stamp on 'boarding pass' ii). the mini trolleys which are otherwise freely available on Amsterdam airport were simply unavailable. The passengers carrying hand bags had to face difficulty in rushing between terminals iii). The sign boards in Moscow airport are not mountedpositioned at appropriate locations. The travelers sometimes have to take U turn to go the correct direction.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

Air Canada,2.0,L James,17th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Toronto to Brisbane via Vancouver. Very uncomfortable experience with Air Canada, especially for the long haul. Is it too much to expect on a 13+ hour long flight that there should be some sort of foot rest so that you can get your feet somewhat elevated. Really felt like ""cattle class"". This is the first time I've ended up with swollen ankles after a long flight and I have been flying back and forth to Australia, 3 times a year for the last 4 years. In flight ""entertainment"" was terrible, food was shocking and the washroom was the tiniest thing I have ever seen. Toilet seat didn't even stay up. No amenities provided except for the obligatory hand soap. One snack was offered up inbetween meals and even though the ""menu"" tells you that snacks are available throughout the flight, flight staff made it quite obvious that they won't get you anything. During the shorter flight from Toronto to Vancouver, the snack / meal cart was only stacked with chocolate and chips. Bad luck if you wanted something hot. Clearly these people do not have experience with the truly great airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Was recommended Air Canada by my travel agent. I'll be letting her know what a terrible choice this was. Pay extra and go with a better airline for long journeys. Really really dreading the return flight.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to BNE via YVR,July 2016,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no
Qatar Airways,6.0,M Vafiadis,31st December 2015,"Alexandria to Kuwait via Doha. My flight from Alexandria wasn't very enjoyable. We did not have personal IFE, but the food was excellent. The seats were average A320 seats. On arrival to Doha we were brought to the terminal with buses - if you travel in the morning and noon, the airport is really empty at these hours. We arrived in Doha around 5pm. Hamad International Airport in Doha is huge, but its extremely easy to navigate through. We had a 3 hour layover but had to time to eat and buy some souvenirs. Our flight to Kuwait was short, but the Boeing 787 seats are crammed, and I did not like the food. It was a kind of pastry with either chicken or lamb and my pastry wasn't baked properly. On flights under than 1 hour earphones won't be given out. The cabin was clean, but the 3x3x3 configuration wasn't what I was hoping for. On my flight back to Doha, the same pastry was offered and I declined. I don't like the dimmable window shade that Boeing 787 aircraft have - extremely annoying to people trying to sleep at day-time. The flight attendants were grumpy on Kuwait flights. Our layover in Doha wasn't as long as on our inbound trip, but we still had time to grab a burger before proceeding to our gate. The airport was empty (it was noon) but be aware that you have to walk a lot (our gate was C13). On the flight back to Alexandria I had lamb and maybe the chicken option would have been better. On both my flights from and to Alexandria the food included fried vegetables, chicken/lamb, a small salad, and a piece of cake. In March I'm flying with Qatar Airways from Cairo to Oman, and I'm looking forward to their 777 cabin layout. I do suggest that people fly on Qatar Airways, it is much more enjoyable than Turkish Airlines for example.",A320 / Boeing 787,Business,Economy Class,HBE to KWI via DOH,October 2015,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,4.0,Rachel Scott,10th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Was scheduled to fly from Medford to Seattle and end in Lihue, Kauai. Our flight was delayed multiple times making a 3 hour delay and would result in missing our connecting flight into Seattle to make it to Kauai. There were no later flights this same day to Kauai, so we were scheduled for the next morning to fly from Medford to Seattle (now weâ€™ve missed our first night of vacation). After asking the airline how often this happens, she responded maybe 1/15 planes are delayed and was unlikely it would happen again. Then our next morning flight scheduled for 5.45am and was for the second time, delayed 3 hours to 8.30am and we were scheduled to miss our connecting flight in Seattle once again! Although Delta re-imbursed tickets and we will still make it to Kauai this evening through yet a third scheduling conflict - it has put us behind 24 hours into our trip.

When i send a feedback to Emirates, no reply back from them. The cabin crew has no regards to the passenger and they would not even react to the call unless you personally go to their area and ask for water. The customer service was a nightmare.

First leg from Manchester to Dubai was very good in A380 with good legroom and excellent inflight cabin service. However, WiFi did not work. Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Narita was very cramped. Emirates have taken off 1 inch from each seat to squeeze additional one seat in a 3-4-3 configuration. This makes the seating very uncomfortable. ICE system did not work very well.

Passenger sitting next to me had to move as that seat would not recline either. Toilets were dirty and had no water in the basin to wash hands. Cabin crew very slow in serving any foods/drinks. It took over three hours before any drinks or food was served after departure. Headphones did not work properly. Had to try 3 different headphones before I found one that worked.

Air New Zealand,4.0,Elisabetha Westerbeek van Eerten,25th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Nelson to Auckland. Air New Zealand has a serious problem with the online booking in that it limits the number of characters of the name to 28. They say it is a legal requirement of international aviation, which I know is not the case as I book online and travel internationally with many different airlines, and no other airline limits the length of the name! This problem has caused hours of head-ache for myself and everyone in my extended family and Iâ€™m sure other people with long names. I have sent emails to the 'topâ€™ of Air NZ and no-one is listening. They keep repeating the same old story about 'it's a legal requirement to limit the name to 28 charactersâ€™. Sadly I made the mistake of booking a flight again this May with Air New Zealand flying co-share on Singapore Airlines, but I'm told by Singapore Airlines they cannot issue a ticket and cannot guarantee that I can board the flight, because my name is not correct! I've called Air New Zealand 3 times with very long phone queues at $1 a minute from Cuba where I live and they say they can't do anything about it. The computer won't allow them to add all the letters in my passport! So now I am left with a ticket on Singapore Airlines that I donâ€™t know I can use on the day of the flight, because Air New Zealand prejudices against people with long names under the premise that it is aviation law.

Qatar Airways,9.0,Iain Bagwell,14th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Atlanta to Kuwait via Doha with Qatar Airways. Great value and service. I managed to get the fare for about $3500 which was far cheaper than any of the other options I had leaving ATL and was impressed with the overall experience. There are a couple of very minor things that might have bothered me if I hadn't got such a good deal. The 2x2x2 configuration seems dated nowadays and the service although great was a little annoying as the attendant who serviced my seat kept trying to suggest things rather that waiting for me to make a decision, but really these are minor comments. Given its a 13 hour flight the I was suitably fed, watered and entertained to have keep me happy. Was there anything absolutely outstanding and noteworthy? No, but there also wasn't anything to significantly complain about. Despite my earlier comment about the configuration, the seats were way better than Delta's business one lay flat and although I gave a good review about AF's long haul BC this was better, even though I can't put my finger on why. I am however looking to my return to USA. The first class lounge at Doha is something to behold. More like a ultra discreet luxe hotel restaurant than a lounge and well worth spending a short time in.

For vegetarians Air India and Jet Airways definitely offer a superior product. The staff on the Delhi flight neglected to distribute immigration forms which meant that the foreigners on the flight had to try and find forms at Delhi airport which was hard as they seemed to have run out.

Air New Zealand,1.0,Berry Keith,17th March 2015,We arrived at Wellington airport on 1st March 2015 for our return flight at about 1pm for flight NZ849 due to depart at 3.45 pm with a check-in time of 2.15 pm. We had booked and paid for this flight on 14th August 2014. Normal check-in procedures did not work and we were advised that the flight had a weight problem and we should check back at 2.30. We advised that we would miss a medical appointment made 4 months previously if we did not catch the flight. When we checked back we were advised that we could not go as the plane had a weight issue. Our luggage was not weighed at any time prior to this and was about half of the allowed weight. If the issue really was one of weight then Air New Zealand is obviously incapable of flying with the baggage allowances that it has set and if passengers with half that allowance are denied access to a flight booked over 6 months previously then they should look at a fairer way of deciding exactly who they will allow on planes. It would seem that this was just an excuse and I strongly suspect that the real issue was that Air New Zealand had over-booked the flight and the issue was one of seating on the plane. If this is indeed the case then it would have been better to have been told this from the outset instead of being jerked around by being told to return at 2.30 pm. Air New Zealand did arrange for alternative travel the next day and they did arrange for overnight accommodation with meals (but no drinks at all including non-alcoholic drinks and the meal allowance for dinner was only sufficient for the main course without either entree or dessert). They also provided both of us with $300 travel vouchers with them but we feel that being lied to and treated in a shoddy manner once by a company is unfortunate: to give that company the opportunity of doing it again is stupidity.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Air Canada,6.0,Golding Jenny,12th October 2014,I travelled from London Heathrow to Calgary return. Check in was speedy. There wasn't a queue to get through security so the Fast Track didn't make much difference. The lounge at Heathrow was spacious and comfortable and the food selection was fine. The 1:2:1 seat formation ensured privacy and the lie flat seat was comfortable and just wide enough. I'm 5ft 7in but if you were much taller or bigger it would be a tight squeeze. The food selection was ok fish meat or veggie but all choices were available. My salmon was well cooked and the vegetables were hot and not overcooked. There was a choice of 2 white wines one of which was not available due to all stock being used on the incoming sector! Come on I'm sure LHR has a pretty good catering set up. I don't drink Chardonnay or red wine (3 choices) so I had to drink beer instead. This really is unacceptable in Business Class. And why no Canadian wines? The service on both sectors was efficient and friendly so no complaints there. I can't comment on inflight entertainment as I didn't use it. The WC's were shocking. They smelt like a public urinal with wet floor and paper stuck to the floor - and this was 1 hour into the flight. They obviously hadn't been cleaned at the turnaround. The lounge at Calgary is being refurbished so it was crowded and not very comfortable. All the chairs had rips or worn arms so the refurb is well overdue. The flight back was ok I got my wine this time! The toiletries supplied were an unknown brand and not worth bothering with very basic. For the amount of money paid for Business Class they could do better. It's more like Premium Economy except for lie flat beds. If the LHR/Calgary sector had Premium Economy I would have taken it. Next time I will try Canadian Affair (charter) Premium Economy. This was a leisure trip so expense was very important as I was paying!

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Tercon Bojan,14th January 2015,Pre - and post - flight experience was terrible! Delayed flight by several hours due to bad weather no one can give you information on your long-haul connecting flight that I missed and no business class service! Thankfully they make up for it onboard. Even though it's a narrow-body you have a chef onboard and the food is totally outstanding. You (nearly) forget about all the problems you've had until then! The 3.5 hour flight on an older A321-200 has a 3-3 business class configuration where the middle seat is made into a table. Comfortable. But it's the service and food that made the Turkish flight superb.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,4.0,yes

Lufthansa sent a text message our flights were cancelled and advised to look for alternative flights. The link provided in the text message didn't work (server error), neighter did their phone contact - all lines busy, please call later (repeated several times). We lost a few hours trying different contacts via mail, phone - nothing worked. Eventually we decided to take a trip to the airport and talk to their staff there. They re-booked our flights, but more than half a day was lost. That wasn't the end of the problems. When we arrived to Arlanda our checked-in suitcase didn't. As the baggage handling staff explain, it was because of our flight was rescheduled. I could understand that unsatisfied employees go on strike, but I'm also convinced there should be a functioning emergency plan for that kind of situation.

Emirates,7.0,N Sutherland,16th April 2014,I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 6 or 7 years and it seems the reliability is slipping. LGW-BKK-LGW - all flights were late (up to 1.5 hours) except the DXB-LGW leg. 2.5 hour connections in DXB are now becoming very tight and stressful due to lateness of flights and the inordinate amount of bussing in DXB. Check-In (online) on all flights excellent. As for the flights themselves all very full so Emirates must be doing something right. Cabin Service in Business is OK but nothing special and in Economy is very much dependent on the crew - can be highly variable. On the plus side the in flight entertainment is good the prices are competitive and frequent fliers are frequently upgraded. The bad news is that Emirates seem to be expanding faster than DXB is so I don't see the transit experience getting any better any time soon.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes
Air Canada,1.0,Dani Lapointe,12th December 2015,"My boyfriend and I recently took a flight with Air Canada from Ottawa to Vancouver and had the worst experience we have ever had on a flight. We had arrived at the airport with ample time before our flight, we had already checked in online and prepaid for our suitcase to be checked. All we had to do was print off our boarding passes and check our bag. We waited in line for an atrocious amount of time (there werenâ€™t even many people in line) as Air Canada employees socialized with each other instead of getting people through in a timely fashion. When we finally got up to the counter, they told us we had missed the deadline for baggage check by 2 minutes. The employee were so rude and kept emphasizing that we were late and needed to arrive earlier, use the kiosks instead, etc., as he clearly saw us waiting in line for more than 20 minutes. We checked in our suitcase at a baggage storage unit in the airport overnight instead for $8, and rushed through the airport in order to make it to our flight on time. We got to the gate as they were just finishing boarding our flight. We were about to board when the flight attendants tell us they have no more room for carry-on baggage, and they need to start checking our carry-ons. That alone would have been frustrating enough, but that, added to the fact that we were just denied the ability to check our bag and had rushed around the airport in order to store it, was downright infuriating. Additionally, we did not get beverage service on the flight for 3 hours.

Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served.

I never heard loud voices, and the announcements were limited to initial departure and final descent. Finally - new boarding process. It seems more organized, especially with the pillars. However, two things kind of irked me: 1) Delta created all of these new boarding groups, yet still had and additional three ""special"" (those needing a little extra time, active military and those with children under two). I think one ""special"" boarding will do, and 2) There were no pillars for Main 3 and Basic Economy (last two boarding groups).

Same departure city Houston, same time 9 am, same arrival time 2 pm, instead we are not only kept in the dark but left with the responsibility of finding accommodation until tomorrow - meanwhile we are now paying for two hotels, one in Houston away from family, and in Costa Rica where we should have been.

Lufthansa,10.0,Kyle Seagrove,21st October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Munich to Vancouver. Business Class Seat 8A on a new A350 is on my opinion is the best seat on this aircraft, the last row of Business Class, with only one row in front of it, and divider to Premium Economy behind. Lots of space, away from galleys and far enough from lavatories. Two things that are inconvenient - the aircraft is extremely noisy and the noise cancelling headphones, attached to seats in Business Class are very bulky and impossible to sleep in. Ear plugs don't help with the noise. I've done this route three times in the past year, and I always choose 8A on MUC - YVR leg. Service is impeccable, food could be hit and miss, entertainment is great and the aircraft is not good, but that's what Lufthansa flies on this route, hence I don't have much choice. There is one more thing - for some reason Business Class on long haul flights seems to be heated to the point of turning into a sauna on a long haul flights, I've noticed that on every flight.

American Airlines,10.0,Russell Conyers,22nd December 2014,Give credit where credit is due-on the 16th of December I boarded AA193 in First seat 3E to connect in JFK to AA1416 to BDA also in First seat 3E. Due to a technical fault we had about an hour delay in BOS and I was concerned that I (and my fellow connecting passengers) would miss our connections. The captain did his best to make up time and after arriving at the gate (12) the lead flight attendant asked passengers not connecting to remain seated and let passengers with connections to disembark first. My BDA flight was at gate 40 and I made the fligh t- with moments to spare! Upon arriving in BDA was very surprised to see that my 2 bags had also made it.

They tell me they are working on the problem but in the meantime I have to take my luck when it comes to getting a seat on the plane that either isn't at the back of the plane or not being able to sit with my husband and usually getting a middle seat. What does it take and how long does it take for a website to take a credit card other than an American one and why isn't this a priority getting it fixed or why can they not take a credit card over the phone to book the seat?

I asked three times, and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly, but never did. After the third attempt, I gave up. What annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence, after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence! I had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the Atlantic, and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion (different airline). So I had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. In the end, I arrived in Tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache (seats seemed to be made of cardboard). The only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment, which included wifi and live tv.

As a Stage 4 Breast Cancer patient they literally made the start of 2017, a start I will not forget! On January 2nd my friends and I were set to board a Delta flight from Chicago to Paris where we had a layover before getting to Dublin. I made Delta aware two months prior that I needed an accommodation made to have a seat in Bulk as I had just finished chemo in September and my oncologist wanted me up moving and stretching throughout the flight. Unfortunately, upon arriving to check in, I noticed that this hadn't been done, but explained my situation to them and they kindly placed me in an appropriate seat. Prior to boarding my name was called and they had decided to move me into business class. In addition when they found out I was flying with friends they moved their seats up to premium economy, so that I would be able to easily be able to walk up and down the aisles and talk with them. Throughout the flight the staff checked on me and my friends as well. Delta Airlines has a Breast Cancer Research Foundation and this is the first time that I've actually seen a company represent the Pink Ribbon so well!

Next problem is at boarding which is total mayhem with economy class trying to board at once resulting in delays and a scramble for overhead locker space.

Air Canada,3.0,S Ray,19th April 2014,We flew LGA-YUL and back on AC. My finance and I flew out separately and returned together. Staff were polite enough in LGA but displayed a consistently lackadaisical attitude. They didn't start boarding the flights until 10 minutes or less before scheduled departure (even though the plane had been at the gate for at least 30 minutes prior) so predictably both flights pulled back from the gate late. My flight then took a 30 minute tour around the taxiways which granted AC has no control over but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started our take off. On the return trip we first ran in to possibly the rudest person working a service job I've ever encountered at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologized for her co-worker. Again at the gate the staff was lackadaisical fumbling around and not boarding the flight until 10 minutes before departure (even though the boarding pass said boarding would start 55 minutes prior to departure and the plane was at the gate for a good 20 minutes at least before boarding started). Luckily it only lead to 5-10 minutes delay on the YUL-LGA trip. On all 3 flights there were no announcements about how or where to pick up baggage when we landed. Overall I feel like we were lucky that our AC experience was only somewhat bad. The general attitude and competency of the AC staff gave me absolutely no confidence that they would have been able to handle any real problems. I'm going back to Montreal again next year and will do my best to avoid AC for that trip and any others I take in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no

Having flown 7hrs with Qatar from Edinburgh to Doha with a quick change to this 16hr 30 minute flight I was concerned that it would feel very uncomfortable being on such a long flight. I'm happy to say It was not. You just relax into it, especially in business class. This is a wide bodied aircraft which felt quite spacious in business having 6 seats to the row and a large personal tv screen for all the movies. The food was fantastic - having had a beef meal on the previous flight, I chose a Nobu lightly spicy broth with seafood followed by a fabulous red snapper, saffron cream and asparagus and the wines worthy of this airline which was deservedly voted having the best wine cellar in the sky. (Ch. Brane Cantanac red, fine Chablis and Babich Sauvignon from Marlborough NZ). Best of all was the flexibility about when to eat and being such a long flight, there was a constant supply of bottled water, cups of tea and snacks. The seating arrangement works well with easy access to the aisles although a little more storage space for the things we want beside us on a long haul flight would have been more helpful. The cabin crew were charming and no request was too much trouble.

American Airlines,1.0,W Staab,11th February 2015,JFK-Bermuda-JFK. Flight to Bermuda uneventful though only soft drinks served despite being an International flight at dinner hour nary a peanut to be seen. Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,10.0,J Kell,17th March 2014,Flew AMS-YUL and return on KLM on 14th and 21st February respectively. On the first leg our original plane developed a fault which resulted in a delay of 3 hours. However arrangements were swiftly made to bring in a replacement aircraft (even the same type MD-11 allowing us to keep our original seating assignments). Despite the delay the cabin crew were not grumpy in fact they were very friendly the seats were comfortable and the food delicious - KLM economy class desserts are certainly a cut above the rest. A wide range of in-flight entertainment kept us entertained throughout the flight. Return flight was even better than the first - Cabin crew were brilliant - the food quality was again high all of which contributed to a very enjoyable flight. The plane itself was in good shape - the whole point of the trip was to fly on the MD-11 and we were able to accomplish this with pleasure. We have used KLM in the past and will continue to use and recommend them in future as they can be relied upon to provide superb reliable service and to find solutions to problems swiftly when things go wrong.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

A full plane but any situations were quickly dealt with by the friendly helpful cabin crews departures and arrivals were quite punctual and connections were handled perfectly. Decent meals (with freshly warmed bread rolls served from a separate basket - a nice touch) and plenty of drinks available throughout the flight.

On one ticket the online system allowed me to select a seat next to the other ticket but as I proceeded to check out it declared I had not selected a seat. On the 4th try the seat selection still did not work and the fare increased another $40+. I called for assistance and was told seat was available and that they handled it. When I asked about the increase in fare they said yes that is the way it works sometimes if you are on the system for 15 minutes the fares can increase. This is not the consumers fault that Virgin's online system did not work properly but they penalize the consumer.

United Airlines,1.0,T Burke,30th November 2015,"Purchased tickets well in advance for a trip to Hawaii from Chicago. Upgraded tickets to First Class knowing that special perks are included (free luggage, etc). Over the months, United Airlines sent me a number of schedule changes and most were not an issues. However, the return flight from OGG to ORD via HNL has become a problem not only because they kept moving the time earlier and earlier (remember, I'm on vacation in Hawaii), but put us on Island Air which only offers economy class and charge for baggage ($80.00 for our 4 bags). This is unacceptable and in my opinion, quite unfair. I called UA's customer service and am so disappointed with the level of customer service or lack of that I received. The agent was difficult to understand due to her heavy accent and was in some ways, quite rude. Take or leave it attitude. Although she offered to move our flight to a different connection through LAX, she stated we would have to pay the difference since we upgraded to first class. How is this right? She told me that she couldn't do anything and when I explained that I have a 3.5 hour layover and that I would have to pay for bags, she didn't have any solutions for me. Rather she argued with me, told me she would talk to a supervisor, put me on hold only to come back and say that it was going to a considerable hold since her supervisor wasn't available and then continued to state she would be happy to cancel my flight altogether and refund me, but I would lose my upgrade that I used. Then she tells me that my husband's status means that we get one bag each checked free. I inquired how does this help me if I'm flying a different airline? She had no answer and again offered to cancel my tickets for a refund. How is this a solution? Her last solution was to call Island Air. Honestly, United Airlines used to be such a great airline - what has happened? Where did customer service go? What benefits do you get anymore for being loyal to an airline and actually paying to maintain a higher status (silver)? We are so disappointed. And I know that there is a very high chance that my comments will be ignored, as they have in the past when I have participated in surveys and given very honest answers with no care or response from United Airlines.

American Airlines,10.0,David Iles,17th September 2014,Miami - Los Angeles.

The crew were excellent attentive without being intrusive used our names when asking what we would like to drink and all made us all feel welcome on board. The food was very palatable. IFE was limited to drop down screens as the aircraft whilst scheduled to be one of the newer A321s in two class configuration was swapped out for an older 737 still wearing the old AA livery hence the 2 stars for IFE.

Upgrade includes a checked bag a free head set and unlimited food drinks and movies on demand onboard. The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat. Crews on both flights did not tidy up the restrooms which were always in great demand.

First to enter the plane are business and first class passengers. Greeted by a very lovely flight attendeant, I got served an orange juice. Soon after takeoff, I got nuts and another cold drink. The selection on the menu was as expected for a 7 hour flight: one main meal and 1.5 hours before arrival, a small breakfast. The vegetarian option was excellent, the pasta cooked well. After the food service, the lights were dimmed. I tried my seat functions, pretty standard seat for business class. Yet I was happy about the lie flat seat. The entertainment system worked well, the selection of movies was quite impressive! The only downside to the entertainment options I found was WiFi connectivity. It did not connect for 2/3 devices of mine. Also, the price of WiFi is very high considering I flew in Business class. Some airlines offer this service for free. After a long sleep, a flight attended woke me up and asked to serve me breakfast. This was a much more simple meal, all on one tray. Then I arrived in Berlin.

I sat on hold with them for over an hour, till the representative came back and said they couldn't do anything about it over the phone and I would have to go directly to the airport to fix the problem. But also assured me that there were plenty of seats left and not to worry. I didn't want to take a chance, so I went online to check in and paid an extra fee to upgrade our seat so that I could move them together. When we got to the airport, they had moved our seat again, and they were no longer together again. They told me the plane was full and they couldn't do anything about it. Nor would they refund the fee I paid earlier. I would of made more of a big deal about it, but there was a family of 5 with small children in front of me that they did this same thing to, with seats not near each other.

American Airlines,1.0,Sarah Hakola,18th December 2016,"New York JFK to Akronâ€“Canton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration. The lack of support and concern for their passengers is ridiculous and I will never fly AA again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to CAK via CLT,December 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,9.0,Craig Cutts,2nd May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | One way between Cape Town to London Heathrow via Doha with Qatar Airways. I travelled with Virgin Atlantic out to South Africa so was interested to see how they match up. Check in at CPT was quick but not much other interaction from the agent security was fairly quick, Qatar use the Bidvest lounge which was okay with food and drink on offer enough seating too. Boarding was a little slow I think due to the late arrival of the the aircraft but once on board the crew where responsive polite offering drinks amenity kits and menus. Flight departed around 30 minutes late I was in seat 2A which was very comfortable once airborne meal orders taken drinks offered and an apology for the late departure from the crew manager. Food was pretty good as was the service, I managed some decent sleep during the 9hrs 20min flight the entertainment system was okay but not very responsive. Arrival in Doha on time to a remote stand business class passengers bussed separately to the terminal, I used the Qatar lounge which is very good although huge it feels fine. Boarding from A3 on to the LHR flight was organised I had seat 22A on this flight which I like at the rear of business cabin. Again crew very responsive offering PJs night kits drinks etc. Departed on time although I skipped food and opted for breakfast 2 hours before arrival. I slept for 4 hours of this night flight woke by the crew to a pretty good breakfast about 2 hours out of LHR. Flight arrived almost 1 hour early which was nice bags off quickly I was home within an hour of landing. Great service I prefer the A380 to other Qatar aircraft although not used A350 yet.

Alitalia,1.0,T Breeland,15th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Bologna to Rome. I am forced to use Alitalia on domestic flights. I wanted to add two suitcases online before flying - the website didn't work! The android app didn't work. I phoned their service number and after 10 minutes was asked to call another number. The service number charged me 10 euro for nothing. The alternative number answered in the rudest way to call the service number instead. I called back as I now wanted this to work - and having said how bad everything was for me a patient person took care of me and took my credit card details to pay for the two suitcases - the first I was told cost â‚¬30 and the second â‚¬55 - I said I called because I wanted the internet discount of â‚¬20/â‚¬44. She had to check and came after a long time back. I now did this to check their incredibly bad performance knowing very well it would be cheaper to pay the full price instead of the expensive telephone. She came back and said they would give me the lower tarif and she took my card details and she said it was OK. I checked afterwards if it was registred on my booking, but the website then told me my booking wasn't found! I gave up to phone back and wasn't sure what to expect at the airport the next day. They did find my booking, but not any mentioning of included luggage. I had to go and pay the full tarif having spent a lot of time and money (almost â‚¬30) on phone calls in addition.

Air NZ does not provide toothbrush and toothpaste which are available on Cathay Pacific and Singapore long haul flight. In terms of in-flight entertainment movies were out dated.

No queuing necessary so the transfer time of around 2 hours was almost too long since security checks were not crowded. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The service was excellent the cabin very modern (new 747-8) and the inflight entertainment offered a lot of variety of current movies and TV shows. Another benefit is that the train ride from Cologne to Frankfurt is rewarded with Miles too.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,C Lethino,27th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats. There seems to be a problem with the seat plan they are looking at, which is likely inconsistent with the real seats of the plane.

Passengers from our flight were the first to arrive at the Ankara Transit Lounge and then came passengers from 7 other re-routed flights. Food was scarce. One sandwich and one cold drink in 10 hours. Snack store made money hand over fist. The worst part was that there were hardly any Turkish Airlines officials available to tell us that what the plan was. There were no public announcements about how long we will be there. People started to get angry not because they were stuck at the airport, they were angry because the Airline staff never bothered to tell us how long we will be stuck there. After about 10 hours of being in the transit lounge, they finally said we will be taken to a hotel for overnight stay. They said they will pay for the visa fee. We finally were herded to immigration and found out that we have to pay the visa fee and file for a reimbursement later. Some people had no $$s cash with them. Some people were very angry as $40 was a huge sum of money for them. After another two hours in the immigration line, we got our visas and were told that there are buses outside waiting to take us to hotel. Well, that was too good to be true. It took another 2.5 hours of standing in line in front of the terminal exit waiting for the buses to arrive/load. Finally we were got into a bus. On a positive note, the hotel was nice and dinner was free.

I was able to find an alternate route. Toronto/Cleveland/Chicago/South Bend. There was availability on an Air Canada outbound to Chicago but she would not consider this.

I've flown in economy class from Prague to Athens in A320 and then continued to Larnaca on an A321. Seats were comfortable in both planes and leg room was ok, but A321 had better legroom. Food was distributed really quickly and it was alright, we had pasta on one flight and meatballs on the other one, plus a snack and a chocolate bar. Drinks were also good and there was a good selection of them. Flight crew were also friendly and both flights arrived a little bit early. There was only one problem and that was that check in had be done by yourself (I do it online anyway, but some people might have problems with it).

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Shane Tarr,4th March 2015,I have flown with Turkish Airlines three times in the past year. Once from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh Return (suppose it qualifies as a flight) once from Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Istanbul Return and once from Bangkok to Tashkent via Istanbul Return. All flights were way above average - and I know what I am talking about because in the past 12 months I have flown on TG QF VN SQ NZ and PX on more than 50 return flights. I actually hate flying but have to fly to my place of assignment but flying Turkish Airlines is very good. Most cabin staff - male or female - are very good to excellent (several among the best I have ever dealt with) the food is very good IFE way above average and aircraft in very good condition (staff make sure toilets are always kept clean and are up there TG QF CX and NZ). My only real grip is rush rush at transit - Istanbul Airport not the best in the world although Turkish Airlines Lounge must be one of the best - and one of the A321 I flew on from Istanbul to Tashkent had several rows of non-reclining seats (mine 9C) so I must read Seat Guru more carefully in future.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

They had me wait in line for 20 plus minutes after they knew I was already running late. As soon as I got up to the lady she tells me it is too late and I cannot get on the flight. I asked there has to be an alternative, and explained my roommate who I came with and was my ride also we showed up together at the same time and she was able to check her bags. I spoke with a supervisor as she told me the same thing, there is nothing they can do but put me on a 6pm flight (mind you it was 9am at this time) and I was originally on the 6pm flight and they moved me to the 9am flight because of weather delays in Philadelphia. This being said they did nothing to help try to accommodate me and did not show one bit of guilt or sorrow in any way. I went ahead and bought an American Airlines ticket and they were amazing.

I also fly a lot with LH or KLM/AF (in Economy). You can't compare them with TK. The airplane seemed to be new. Both flights were with an A321. On both ways, there was IFE with a large choice of different international movies and documentaries. Never seen this before on an A321 or/and on short-haul. The flight time was enough to watch one movie. However, When you watched a movie and had your earphones on, the cabin announcements were so loud. Food was delicious. At first you get a turkish delight. For the meal, you could choose between Turkish meat-balls and something with chicken. I had the meat-balls which was great. Alcoholic drinks were free. I took a beer and a freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff were nice. Seat comfort is ok. I'm 5ft. 10in. I had enough space to the front and for my legs. The space to my neighbour was fine.

Emirates,1.0,P Pearce,18th August 2014,We flew on an Emirates ( Qantas codeshare) Sydney - Paris - Sydney. I strongly advise anyone contemplating this option to forget it. The flight goes to Bangkok where you spend 1-2 hours on the tarmac/transit lounge with the 'joys' of the dual security inspection at Bangkok airport and the usual scam of your duty free bottles etc being confiscated unless you have made the necessary arrangements before hand. Then to Dubai (another couple of hours). The total is close enough to 27 hours from Sydney to Paris. The return flight was worse. Late take off from Paris (unexplained delay nearly two hours) tushed transit in Dubai then a late take off. Then the Bangkok nonsense (and the inevitable late take off). And the food option s- if you don't eat chicken then a diet faces you. Chicken featured as one of two options on every leg every meal and complemented the chicken 'appetiser' - of course you could have chosen the Asian style fish - not an attractive dish.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,M Famura,10th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Los Angeles. Ground crew is just terribly unhappy. Rude and condescending. They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and thatâ€™s Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me itâ€™ll be 45 min and they canâ€™t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something donâ€™t leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldnâ€™t care. I would say go pay a little more and pick better service. Itâ€™s not that I lost something, itâ€™s how the crew treated me after having dropped an item that I could have retrieved if they had let me look for it",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Los Angeles,December 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,H Steivel,8th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some donâ€™t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600â‚¬ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didnâ€™t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just donâ€™t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They donâ€™t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They donâ€™t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, thatâ€™s just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldnâ€™t be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected, I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again.

I stated, ""No. My mother is 80 years old and does not know how to use them, so we would like to check in here"". She gave us a bad attitude while her friends still stood there doing nothing to help other passengers, by maybe calling them over to their empty check in stations.

Apparently, American Airlines would rather pay staff to stand around and *watch customers use the kiosk*, rather than offer assistance to elderly passengers, who remember the days of checking in at the counter with a live friendly agent, not an robot?! I was furious my mother was treated this way. To top it off, they also put us in separate seating rows at checkin, yet when I booked our tickets, I had chosen seats together online.

Emirates,7.0,David Ellis,17th November 2014,LHR - DXB - CPT. Quick boarding of A380 direct from T3 Emirates lounge. Centre pair of seats excellent for a couple. FAs rather robotic with little warmth or humour. Dinner service slow with overcooked main course. A380 impressively quiet on upper deck. Excellent IFE but annoying that one has to use supplied noise cancelling headphones. Flat bed seats reasonably comfortable. Quick disembarkation to huge Emirates lounge at DXB. Bizarre bus journey (30 minutes!) to 770-300 on the other side of the airport for the flight to CPT. FAs again going through the motions and food service just as slow as on A380. Flight noticeably noisier. 2-3-2 business class seating arrangement affords little privacy and seats don't lie fully flat.

United Airlines,1.0,T Mastomaki,19th January 2015,UA163 GUM-ICN 1/5/2015. We sat in the airplane 1.5 hours before departure due to a missing logbook. Add 5.5 hours to destination makes 7 hours total time in ac. Breakfast was served it was small and below standard. Flight attendants were hard to find for any extra drinks. 2.5 hours prior to destination captain turned on fasten seat belts sign due to turbulence hence terminating inflight service. There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers. Inflight entertainment was poor quality. The small movie screen had continuous static making it impossible to watch.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,2.0,W Doralt,11th May 2014,We were disappointed by the standard of the flight from Male to Dubai. The plane was old old entertainment system (not very responsive and outdated quality also the Arabic subtitles in large size could not be switched off) and all interior a bit worn off. One would not expect it with this airline. Food was mediocre at best and the preferred choice was gone before our row was served. Drinks (non alcoholic and alcoholic) were all fine though. Toilets: Two toilets out of soap relatively soon after the start of the flight. Not great also in terms of cleanliness. Floor: Worn off but mainly disturbing because staff did not collect / pic up plastic debris fallen on the floor during the flight. Main ground for disappointment was the broken tray (46G) preventing you from eating (nothing could be put on the tray without falling / sliding off). Staff apologised but in the end though they were friendly that does not take away the inconvenience and as the flight was full (at least in econ.) a change of seat was no option.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no

When I approached several different counters in the gating sections to ask for help, several desk employees walked passed me multiple times, with knowledge I was there for help as they were more interested in conversing amongst themselves or being on their phone.

Jetblue Airways,4.0,Brian Lally,28th September 2014,I recently traveled round trip from Boston to Orlando. I traveled out of Boston on September 14 2014 and we were about 20 minutes delayed leaving Boston due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. I have to say it was a great flight and the pilot made up time arriving in Orlando for an on-time arrival the crew were great plenty of legroom plenty of drinks and snacks. The overall flight to Orlando was excellent. Coming home to Boston yesterday was a different story the male flight attendant on the Orlando-Boston route was extremely rude. No smile as we boarded the aircraft no hello to the passengers just miserable. I traveled with 2 friends on board the flight and the tray table was defective and the soda went all over my friends pants. I went to ask this flight attendant for some paper towels and he rudely said get back to your seat because there was turbulence. I understand the safety protocols when it comes to turbulence but at least take initiative to the passengers requests. There was no apology from him for this defective tray table.

We had a delay leaving Acapulco and the agent who checked us in for the flight came and told us that the flight was delayed leaving Mexico City. He had rebooked our flight to LAX and changed our baggage claim tags. We both had first class seats assigned. Unfortunately we both found the new first class seat design on the 737-800 torturous.

Aeromexico,3.0,G Markham,17th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew out from Heathrow to Mexico City on 29 March 2018, and later I flew from Mexico City to Havana on 11 April, returning on 14 April, before returning to London later that evening. Flight from London was good (although we had upgraded to AM plus). Flights to and from Cuba were both fine too. I had read that the planes were old on that route, but everything seemed ok to me. My beef is with the return trip from Mexico City to London. I checked in very early that evening (it was impossible to check in online from Cuba as the website said I had to go to the airport in Mexico City), yet was told that I was on standby. I booked the flights in 2017, and Aeromexico should have realised that I was travelling with them from Cuba to Mexico City, getting the first available London flight. The rise of budget carriers such as Easyjet has made booking and flight processing more easy. Overbooking is an air industry scandal, and yet Aeromexico staff in Mexico City confirmed that is what they had done. I resent being relegated to standby when I had booked well in advance, and had even upgraded some seats. I was not informed I had a seat until just before an hour before take off. Aeromexico staff on the ground had to deal with young families, single women and groups of women who had all been demoted to standby, like me. The staff said it was company policy to overbook. I find that this is where Aeromexico lets itself down. The stress involved in having to consider getting cash, replanning all transport back in the UK and contacting those who needed to know is an unnecessary one. Aeromexico should reimburse money to all affected passengers. Never again.",Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to London Heathrow,April 2018,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,no

I have flown with them several times to Asia over the last 8 years and it was OK but last week I went to Dubai via Doha. Unless I have got a lot bigger the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and designed so that when the person in front reclines you have hardly any room. The food was average too. Then I had only one hour to change at Doha and had to literally run to get my connecting flight to Dubai as the airport is quite big. Exhausting. On the way back the check in lady at Dubai told me the flight was quiet (it wasn't) and again the seats were really cramped so much so my leg ached. The inflight crew were bossy and you very much were made to feel like a second class citizen in Economy. They couldn't even serve you a cold beer.

Somehow when we showed up at the airport the seats were separated. Managed to change 1 seat with a nice Japanese lady. Both inflight entertainment systems did not work. About 50% of the cabin had the same issues. How hard is it to test the system beforehand? Or upgrade to a system that works. On the way to Narita we were both stuck with the Japanese meal being at the back of the plane. Was awful. On the return flight back we managed to get seats in the front of the plane and had a much better meal. Still 1 out of 2 inflight systems did not work properly only a couple of movies worked.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Peter Down,25th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I currently work in Adjara, Georgia and the nearest airport is at Batumi. As I am a UK citizen, I frequently fly between Manchester, UK and Batumi, Georgia via Istanbul Ataturk. I have made bookings for three trips between Batumi and Istanbul over the last three months and I have to say the performance of the airline on this route is shockingly poor. On 29 December 2015, my flight from Istanbul to Batumi was cancelled. Weather conditions at Batumi were blamed. I was offered an alternative flight to Trabzon, Turkey instead being told there would be a bus transfer to Batumi. On arrival at Trabzon, there was no information about a bus transfer and no-one seemed to have clue about what to do. Eventually, I managed to find someone who put me on a bus (it was obvious this had not been arranged to cater for the disruption) which then left meet at the Georgian border at Sarpi. I was then forced to make my own travel arrangements from there. On 24 February 2016 my flight from Batumi to Istanbul was cancelled. Once again weather conditions were blamed. Today (24 March) my flight from Batumi to Istanbul has again been cancelled with weather conditions at Istanbul Ataturk airport being blamed. However, on checking the Turkish Airlines website, it was noted that other international flights are recorded as having landed at this airport at around the same time my own was due to land. My work colleagues have also experienced similar disruptions and cancellations to their flights over the last three months (some of their experiences were even worse!). The flight between Istanbul and Batumi is supposed to be a scheduled daily flight. However, the level of disruption leads many of us working here in Georgia to believe the airline does not value its customers and can just cancel flights when it wishes if it believes it does not have enough passengers - with weather conditions being blamed as a way to avoid having to pay compensation. As far as I am concerned, this airline does not deserve the award of best airline in Europe.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,MAN to BUS via IST,March 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

On time Departures and Arrivals for all flights apart from MNL-DXB which was 1.5 hours late in leaving MNL due to ""Immigration Delays"" for 15 passengers. Not Emirates fault as such but I'd have thought the Captain would have had a cut-off time with many more passengers (myself included) having tight onward connections in DXB. In fairness they made up 30 minutes en route. In Dubai passengers with tight connections on late arriving flights are usually gathered together and accompanied through the terminal and allowed to make their connection after the 45-minute cut off period stipulated by Emirates - usually. Cabin Service on all flights was perfectly acceptable but the seats on both the B-777 and A380's are not the best. Food in Economy was of a high standard with plenty of drinks choices.

Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations.

For example the AVOD system on these planes is not as sleek as on the B777 which were used for the DOH-MNL sectors, however both provided a good selection of movies both new and old, TV shows, music and games. Seats are generally comfortable although the box for the AVOD system cuts into legroom if you are seated by the aisle or window. The recline is good on both planes as the lower portion of the seat moves forward slightly as the back portion reclines, giving slightly more recline overall. The quality of the food was generally excellent across all sectors, however I was disappointed that on three of the four sectors my first choice was unavailable by the time I was served. On one occasion the air stewardess did make up for this slightly by offering me a crew meal which was similar, however it would be better if the meal choices were available to more of the passengers. Drinks were available throughout the flights although in between meal service you need to go to the galley and ask. We were provided with an amenity kit on the DOH-MNL sectors which included an eye mask, travel socks, toothpaste, toothbrush and lip balm. Free Wi-Fi was available for a limited time on all sectors although the speed on the DOH-MNL sectors was much better - again this might be due to the age of the aircraft. USB ports were available on both planes to charge devices. For the price I paid I was very happy with the service provided and would definitely use Qatar Airways again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Manila via Doha,February 2019,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,E Coleman,14th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Norfolk to Punta Cana via Philadelphia. Once in the plane and pulling away from gate the plane stopped and we sat for approx 20mins. After waiting, the Pilot announces we have a maintenance issue and they are finishing the paperwork and we will be leaving shortly. We leave after about 10 more mins and begin to taxi towards the runway. About halfway there the plane pulls over and the Pilot states â€œsorry folks, the plane is a little grumpy today, we have another maintenance issue and should be ready in about 20 mins. After 29 more mins the Pilot comes back on and says â€œ this isnâ€™t the way we wanted to start your morning or ours, but now there is a ground stop in Philly and nothingâ€™s moving, it should be clear in 29 or so minutes but for now we are go my back to the gate to refuelâ€. By this time we now are going to miss our connecting flight!!! When we arrive in PHL we are told to go to service desk and they were going to put us on a flight with another airline. We arrive at the service desk and are told that there are no more connecting flights to Punta Cana and we would have to fly to MIA and then to Santo Domingo and drive 3hrs to Punta Cana at our own expense or find a hotel at our own expense and fly out on Saturday. Really? We then ask for a manager who tells us there isnâ€™t anything that can be done because the flight was listed as Air Traffic Issue. He then offers us a $12 food voucher for our inconvenience, the food in the airport restaurant is over $12. So now we haves to fly to Mia then to Santo Domingo and drive to Punta , we arrived in Punta Cana at 1:30am. After a 19hr nightmare. We missed our first day at Secrets Royal Beach all Resort and couldnâ€™t get a refund all because of American Airlines.

Aegean Airlines,2.0,K Forakis,5th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Athens to Paris CDG with Aegean Airlines. 48h prior to departure passengers receive an email which encourages them to check in online so that they can choose their seat, free of charge. However, even if you try the online check-in in the very first minute of these 48h, the seat map of your flight will appear full and you wonâ€™t be able to change your allocated seat. This is a constant situation for more than a year now and it affects even passengers with flexible fares. The call centre, unable or unwilling to help, simply confirms their practice of â€œpreseatingâ€ which does not allow you to seat next to a friend or colleague with whom you donâ€™t share the same book reference. The experience at Aegean drop-off check-in in ATH is awful, especially if your flight departs between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Cabin crew members are in general distant, indifferent and not necessarily polite enough. Service on board is average. Instead of caring for the comfort of all their passengers, Aegean are crawling to families (â€œAegean for familiesâ€).

They wouldnâ€™t allow overhead access which is a new rule but it can go under your seat. I applied by this rule. As Iâ€™m boarding the plane they told me I had to check my bag and couldnâ€™t board with it. This is absolutely bogus. I had to complain to them to let me bring my bag on. They told me there wasnâ€™t anymore overhead bin room. Great, I get that, but mine fits under the seat as I premeasured my bag. They said they didnâ€™t care, they didnâ€™t have overhead bin access so I had to check my bag. I told them I understand that there isnâ€™t but mine fits under my seat. They then tried to say that it didnâ€™t matter because I had two bags, the second being my purse... since when do purses count? But that could also fit in my bag so i put my purse in my bag. They eventually let me take my bag (which comfortably fit under my seat) but I had to complain to them more than enough times.

Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew.

Since we wanted good seats, we booked early and got seats on the two-seat side very far up in Economy Plus. (That plane has a 2-5-2 configuration.) However, when we printed out our boarding pass the day before the flight, United had left my wife with the window seat but moved me about 25 yards back in the 5-seat section. We were shocked. There was no change of equipment, which might have explained it. No explanation, no apology. When we got to the airport, I said to the attendant at our gate that we chose our seats well in advance, so by rights those two seats together should be ours. She gave me a sly smile and said, in effect, ""No, you have no right to those seats. United retains the right to reassign seating for no reason or any reason, and that's what we've done."" Chalk it up to declining competition in the airline industry. With so few competitors, United feels they can treat their customers like pawns that they freely move around on the board at their whim. Last April we flew on United from Paris to Chicago non-stop. Once the doors were closed and the pilot taxiing to the runaway, the flight attendant said, in effect, ""You think we're flying non-stop from Paris to Chicago. We're not. We're flying from Paris to Newark where this flight will end."" The explanation: the pilot's maximum flying hours expired when we got to Newark. We were delayed many hours at Newark before they lined up a plane for us to take to Chicago.

First I need to tell about my bad experience with other airlines then only you will understand my wonderful experience with Qatar Airways. We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they donâ€™t know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized itâ€™s impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we donâ€™t have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I donâ€™t have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but donâ€™t have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and donâ€™t know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny. Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,Rupert Grey,29th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Edmonton. The seats did not recline to horizontal. You slide off them so sleep is not possible. We paid some C$3000 each and expected normal business class accommodation. No warning of this sub-standard accommodation was given when booking through Expedia. Detailed research failed to reveal it. The senior purser agreed that it was well below standard. So did the station-manager in Edmonton. KLM customer support ignored their views. It dismissed our subsequent complaint on the basis that information about the seats ""is explicitly presented on our website"". In fact it is far from explicit. Firstly, you do not expect to pay a full business class fare and get nothing more than oversize economy seating. Secondly even if you spend time trying to check it is virtually impossible to work out which aircraft you will be on. In addition the promise that you will have a privacy canopy is surprising. There was none visible nor any sign that there ever had been. We feel thoroughly cheated. The casual dismissal of our complaint has made it worse.

Check-in at the announced check-in opening time (3 hours before schedulded departure). Lots of passengers already waiting in line. Only three check-in agents on duty. Schedulded departure time was 18.30 hours, 18.25 hours take-off. Flight was not full - I had a bulkhead seat just behind Business-Class. Friendly welcome by the mostly Thai crew onboard. Seat was comfortable, screen and earphone quality outstanding and the entertainment selection classy which means a lot of arthouse movies and first rate recordings of operas and classical music available. Toilets were clean and roomy - impressed by the mood-lighting. Instead of the usual cold white lighting: warm and red colours which even made the ""necessary"" a pleasant and entertaining experience. Only disappointment was the food: quality, presentation and quantity were nothing to write home about. I had salad and apple-pie dessert but left the main course untouched. There is room for improvement. However on the plus-side drinks-rounds were frequent.

However I have just returned from Munich having one of the worst experiences ever. After moving seats because my entertainment screen did not work, I was seated in one of the two remaining empty seats. I was seated in 48J between two obese travellers and a young woman. As the obese lady needed 1.25 seats it was 12 hours of hell. The food trays were left for an hour which made it impossible to go to the bathroom or move around. Window shades were left open when it was sleep time, when I asked an attendant to request it to be closed I was informed ""sorry the man is asleep"". If a plane is going to be 100% full may I suggest they put on the amount of staff required to service the customers. On the first leg of my journey it was 45 mins before I got a glass of water, I rang the bell but no one replied. I was next to the window and man next to me had all his computer gear (large laptop) because his entertainment system did not work. At the last leg of my journey waiting to use the bathroom for a good ten minutes it was opened by an attendant, who removed the garbage bags so I could use it. Waste was overflowing in the restrooms. The worst was being locked into my seat by food trays, left for what seemed forever. The last experience I had like this was with a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, at least they apologised and explained that they were on staff member down.

Southwest Airlines,3.0,C Smith,25th November 2010,As a young inexperienced traveler I relied on our travel agent to recommend the best airline for our honeymoon. She recommended Southwest as the best. We book at a reasonable rate for the holiday season as soon as tickets became available. Everything was good to go until we got our tickets with no seat number. We ended up being one of the last people on the plane with only a few middle seat left scattered across the plane when we got on. Then we saw an open pair together only to be rudely told by a stewardess that they were reserved in case another family boarded. I politely said how about a new family we just got married. She rudely said no find a seat and turned around. Luckily a kind man gave us his seat so we could sit together but the rest of the trip we full of rude comments from the stewardess about how she couldn't believe he moved!,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no

Emirates,8.0,S Roche,15th July 2014,SYD-DXB-DUB. DUB-DXB. I have mixed feelings about Emirates. I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build.

Emirates,6.0,J Gromek,4th May 2014,"On a recent flight on 22 April from Warsaw to Guangzhou via Dubai (EK180) I was upgraded to Business Class. Finally I get to sample the much advertised Emirates Business Class. The Business Class was full and so was the entire flight I assume. The welcome was the usual that you get with the welcome drink but none of the staff offered to take my jacket. After take off the bar service started quite late. There was a wait of approximately 40 minutes. The second round of drinks took ages. I had ordered a second whisky which the staff conveniently forgot. I had to remind to which I was given a curt unapologetic ""it's being made""! That too by the chief purser a lady in her 50's. During the meal which was nice the wine came only once. I had to remind the stewardess to fill-up my long empty glass. The staff was not well-informed about the plane either. I asked one if it was the new 777 to which she replied that she did not know. She never bothered to find-out and inform either. I can say one thing about Emirates. The hardware is there but the 'software' still needs to be updated. Staff training on customer satisfaction has to be intensified. I would not recommend anyone to buy the Business Class unless it's only for the additional comfort. Service is definitely lacking. Wonder what the First Class is like. Taking into account my experience in the Business Class I am certain the pampering is non-existent. Frankly I prefer Lufthansa.

Delta cabin staff are certainly the best by a long mile as compared with the other legacy airline staff in the USA. My flights were a combination of First (internally) and Business (Trans Atlantic). The food on the Trans Atlantic flight was pretty good. My only comment regarding the whole food and beverage service was that the red wine on the LHR/MSP leg was chilled. The equipment used for my Trans Atlantic flight was a 767-400ER which was comfortable (I prefer the Business seating in the 767 as opposed to the A330) and I managed to sleep for 4 hours east bound.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,R Larrson,4th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Atlanta via Key West. I have had a terrible experience flying with this airline. I have traveled all over and Delta is the worst! Where do I start? Purchased tickets with customer service by phone asked for 2 seats right beside each other and specifically asked how many pieces of luggage each passenger can check in? The sales agent responded 2 bags each for first class! The next day we went to the Delta counter to board our flight and the counter agent only said that we were aloud 1 bag to Key West. Had to leave a piece of luggage the airport! Boarded the plane to find out that our seats were not together! Landed at Atlanta airport to eventually find out that our connecting flight was cancelled! Had to get a taxi to a hotel that was discounted and not paid and only having the clothes that we were wearing and nothing else! We left at 3:00am to catch our flight for 5:30am! The Delta agents advised us that we will not receive new boarding passes and that we will have to use our existing boarding passes from the day before, needless to say I had a terrible experience with security because our boarding passes were for yesterday. I finally boarded the plane to find out that the piolets did not receive to necessary paperwork to fly to Key West! We waited 1 hour for someone to hand deliver the paperwork while on the runway. Finally landed in Key West to find out that my luggage and clothing was soaked! Still having issues with baggage claims. They rejected my claim stating that the verbal claim was put in Dec 2nd 2018 when I purchased my tickets December 19th and actually did not land in Key West till Dec 21st when I called about my luggage.

Great friendly efficient staff on the ground and inflight. The overhead bins are the largest i've ever seen and for the first time ever in Hawaii the priority tagged luggage arrived first and in record time. In addition, the Kona ground staff were at luggage claim offering bottled water. Here's the bizarre twist. The first class meal offered was a cold processed sandwich with 3 slices of apple and a Saran wrapped cookie. The wonderful cabin crew was embarrassed and had no idea or explanation. I have flown this flight at least 20 times in the last few years and a hot meal was always offered. This is a 5 hour flight with a 5pm departure in a first class cabin. In addition for a while now Delta has been the only carrier offering wi-Fi between the mainland and Hawaii. Although the aircraft was equipped the service was not available.

The flight took off on time and it was a full flight so knew the service would be slow but waiting 90 minutes after take off for any refreshment is poor by Emirates standards. No pre dinner drink just the food and then another wait for drinks. Crew were surly and clearly didn't want to be at work that day. Asked for another drink to be grunted at by the stewardess who moaned she would have to write my drink down as a few people were asking. If they had been pro active and commenced a drinks service before the food maybe people wouldn't be asking for another drink so soon after the meal. Cabin crew then disappeared and not offered anything else until 2 hours before landing when they came round with afternoon tea. A very small sandwich and a tiny scone.

Virgin America,1.0,C Peale,11th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale. Iâ€™m not sure what has happened to the art of humbly and kindly displaying hospitality in the air, but the crew aboard the Virgin America flight VX 1340 9:30 am on 3/10/2018 to Fort Lauderdale was extremely unprofessional and not eager to be courteous. Early on in our flight, the captain placed the seatbelt sign on due to turbulence. I needed to use the restroom as I glance back I saw a gentleman standing and waiting near where attendants were sitting in their quarters. They were laughing, giggling and flirting with the passenger as he stood and waited for the restroom to become available. When He went into the restroom, I stood up to wait exactly where he just stood, only to get a very rude toned request to sit while I wait. I asked why that gentlemen wasnâ€™t addressed in the same manner to only have another rude response followed by the two employees speaking poorly of me as I entered the restroom. For the remainder of the flight, the stewardesses treated me very poorly and made me feel extremely uncomfortable with nasty stares. At one point I was watching a movie, and the head stewardess, not having any interaction with me prior, came over in an aggressive manner and waved her hand in front of my face, with no smile asked me if there is a problem here she should be aware of, when I said no, because I was not about to have any further aggressive and rude comments thrown my way, she asked again are you sure, I felt bullied on this flight.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,W Renny,12th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Kilimanjaro to London Heathrow via Istanbul. My route on the way to Tanzania wasn't too bad, although my friends bag did get lost. On the way home it was a terrible 24 hours. We got to Kilimanjaro airport early and then when it came to check in three people from my group including myself weren't on the list to fly! We had to wait till after check in had closed for someone to drive to the airport with a different list, during this time we were told nothing we had no idea if we would definitely be on that flight. We finally got through and then very quickly had to go through security again and wait to board. We had a two hour wait even though our plane had arrived - we got given no information. I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours due to the fact you can't take liquids into the airport and then the only place I could buy a drink I was only there for a minute until I had to move again into somewhere we couldn't take liquids. They had moved some people up to business class and then after about an hour took in everyones tickets and got them reprinted, back to economy. Finally once we were on and then arrived at Istanbul, due to the fact we were 2 hours late one of my friends travelling with us had missed her next flight. Throughout the whole journey she was asking for help, she was literally on the back seat of the plane and wouldn't allow her to be one of the first to get off so she was the last person off. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to the airport. Once there we tried to find someone to help her, she asked someone who sent her to somewhere you go if you didn't have a boarding pass - this wasn't the issue (causing her to be even later). We asked 5 people at the airport for help and the staff were all rude saying 'I'm busy' and walking off. Eventually we found someone who told her where to go but it was too late she had missed her flight. I then got on my next plane to Heathrow, once landed at 4.30 I went to collect my luggage, I waited an hour and a half for them to then say 'That's all the bags.' Which meant 6 out of 7 people I was with didn't have their rucksacks. We all went over to lost luggage and there we got told all our bags weren't on the flight and that they were on the next flight coming from Istanbul. If we had been told this earlier it wouldn't have been as big an issue yet we waited an hour and half and parking at an airport isn't cheap! There was no communication at all. We got told we could wait till the next flight came in which was gone 9 in the evening or get our bags delivered to us in a few days. I opted for getting my bag delivered as my parents would have had to pay a fortune on parking else. Not happy at all, such a long tiring day with no communication.

Both the supervisors and staff on both legs should be commended for their efforts. The new airport was a pleasant surprise with no buses. No problems accessing the premium lounge Plenty of drink and food available even though it was a little bit busy. Be prepared to walk a long way to get there and to the gate. However they give you plenty of warning when you are due to board. They scan all passengers in the lounge. You should not be overlooked. Best of all was the smoking lounge where in this politically correct world we live in was a bonus. It is isolated so those of us who wish to smoke can do so in peace. Hats off to the entire experience. I will choose no other airline if it flies the route I am taking.

American Airlines,4.0,F Matthews,25th June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | We just took American first class on a 777 from Dallas Fort Worth to Tokyo Narita. Got a good deal on the flight using miles, but if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is. This class of service should be called enhanced business class, at best. The seats are a bit narrow given the armrests, and hard as bricks. No duvet or other cover to make them into a real bed. They just lie flat. There's also one small pillow. No small light by your seat: if you want a reading light there's only intrusive spotlights in the ceiling panel. 2-together middle seats don't seem to have a partition that rises, which would give you sleeping privacy from a stranger. The bathroom showed a lot of use, with lots of tape and old tape remnants holding in place the toilet. Zero amenities in there, too. There were several lotions in a Cole Hann travel kit by your seat, but not one disposable razor nor shave cream nor comb. Dining was similar. Large portions, but bean counters were again counting. A salad with breakfast had lettuce and two halves of one (yes, one) cherry tomato. Nothing else, not a sliver of a olive nor a shred of onion. And for breakfast forget getting salt and pepper shakers and just rip open a paper packet. There's also no drink cart (a nice way to discourage consumption) and the wines were mostly the sort you find in upscale grocery stores. Stag's Leap is the Chardonnay and one of the reds is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (not to be confused with the fine reds from Montepulciano in Tuscany). Service was spotty. My wife and I were together but I seemed to get dinner service about 10 minutes before her. And collecting headsets an hour before landing only accommodates the crew. There's nothing wrong with all this, since it is serviceable, just like economy motels. But if you're paying for something special, is it too much to expect something special? And if airlines are competing for higher-priced international travel, could American just loosen its purse-strings by, say, $99 a passenger in first class?

Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class.

My first time on Lufthansa Premium Economy, loved the extra space, and must say the Lufthansa meals have improved, the curry dish for dinner was excellent, and the fruit salad served with breakfast was as answer to my prayers - the supply of wine at dinner time and coffee at breakfast is still on the meagre side. Seats comfortable, service great, pity the toilets for economy are at the front of the premium economy cabin, giving a lot of traffic. Also, they seem too few, so queues build up after diner and before breakfast and landing, crowding the cabin and making it busy. After a shower and fast breakfast in the business class lounge in FRA on to BCN, normal economy seat, some coffee and bun - nothing special, dozed. Did not mark the WiFi as I do not carry any devices that need to connect, internet connectivity was advertised on the flight - I just need peace and tranquillity, disconnecting is a plus.

Qatar Airways,10.0,Tom Osborne,24th June 2015,"My second trip with Qatar Airways, last time had the older A330 aircraft. What a difference this time! The B787 seats are not as good as A380, but okay for the shorter flight to Doha. The window shades in this 787 aircraft are rubbish, and they do not block out the sun as was promised when Boeing were advertising the benefits of the plane. The A380 was so much better, nice and spacious and seats very comfortable. IFE is not very different to Emirates or Singapore Airlines that I flew last time, don't understand why everyone raves about Emirates because they just have a huge library of ancient, 2nd rate films. Food was good, not the best but certainly good for Economy cabin trip. Cabin staff were great on both flights, better for DOH-BKK where they were chatty and friendly. Return in 10 days flying out of Singapore and looking forward to getting on their A350 I have read so much about. Definitely recommend Qatar Airways with these new planes, and service seems to have improved from before.",Boeing 787 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR-DOH-BKK,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,D Weare,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We booked KLM flights together from Malaga to Panama (via Amsterdam). We paid 1487.76 euros for the two tickets. Unfortunately I could not get back to Malaga in time to check in, so decided to go straight to Amsterdam and meet my partner there to catch the next leg of the flight. My partner checked in at Malaga as planned and informed the representative at the check in counter that I couldn't get back to Malaga so was going to meet her in Amsterdam. My partner asked if the rep could arrange for our seats to be together for the Amsterdam to Panama flight. The rep advised it was best to both check in again together at Amsterdam. Once at Amsterdam check in desk the representative advised there is a problem and they need to go to the ticket desk. The ticket desk assistant tells me I will have to pay a 500 euro 'penalty' for missing the first flight. Even though I felt like he was being held to ransom I had little choice but to pay the 500 euro 'penalty' if I wanted to continue on the holiday. It took the ticket desk assistant at Amsterdam 10 minutes to carry out some admin and issue a new ticket. How can KLM justify 500 euros for this? It wasn't like we just 'no showed'. My partner checked in as scheduled and informed KLM at the check in desk at Malaga the situation. Why was nothing about penalties mentioned then? So disappointed at KLM's 'computer says no' attitude and their failure to see the customers point of view. Companies that hide behind t's & c's can not be trusted in my opinion. It's easy to be smiley and helpful when things are running to plan, it takes a real customer focused company to actually look into customers problems and come up with win win solutions. If you're flying KLM make sure you read the terms and conditions and don't expect any help if things go wrong.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Malaga to Panama via Amsterdam,January 2018,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,Trond Tornes,25th May 2016,"La Guardia to Los Angeles via Chicago with United Airlines. Bad information and bad handling of passengers after a severely delayed plane. UA 556 8:13pm from LGA. The departure's departure was severely delayed, by more than 1.5 hours. Sms messenges from UA did not reflect any of the information about the delay. After embarking a 25 mins delayed we would sit and wait in the plane for almost an hour, while we were let to know in different ways that we are ready to leave soon. Upon arrival, again little information, even though all conducting passengers obviously had lost their flights' departures. After waiting in line on an under staffed customer service, we were given the usual tricky hotel voucher trip and sent on a mission to find out how to get there. First on our way to a bus stop with such bad descriptions that almost all passengers were lost on the way to find the shuttle bus. Maybe because no one would actually think that we were supposed to cross an insecure road and go through a road construction site for finding it? After asking bus drivers from other hotel services we waited for 25 minutes for the shuttle to the Weston hotel. Now time had gone and the kitchen where we could use the 10 dollars worth coupon for 'a meal' where there happens to be no meals so cheap. As a partner of United Airlines, this hotel also comes without a complimentary internet connection service. I will not trust UA again unless they change information and passenger handling significantly, and I will as much as possibletry to avoid flying with them.

United Airlines,1.0,Shyler King,20th July 2015,"My entire experience with United this weekend was a total disaster. To begin, my flight from Denver to Bend on Friday night was cancelled last minute due to no availability of pilots. They actually scanned our boarding passes in and had us lined up ready to get on the plane just to have us turn around and go back inside to later find out our flight would be cancelled. We then had to fly to Eugene instead, rent a car, and drive 2.5 hours to get to our destination (Bend). Then, I was told my bag would arrive at our place of stay the next morning. I did not receive my bag until 7pm on the 17th. Then, as if this wasn't enough to deal with on our way there, my flights coming home were a disaster as well. We had to return our rental car to Redmond rather than Eugene as that's where our flight was leaving on Sunday. Then, the flight from Redmond to Denver was ""overweight"" due to temperatures in the area. We had to wait until 5 people volunteered to change flights before our flight could leave. I get to Denver only to find out my flight from Denver to SLC was delayed. Not to mention, I already had a 3 hour layover and this delay made it 4+ hours. The flight continued to get delayed and didn't end up leaving Denver until about 1am. I did not get home until 3am. I am completely upset with my entire United experience and will not be flying United again. The customer service was awful. None of the employees even knew what was going on and when approached with a question they were unbelievably disrespectful.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Salt Lake City,July 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,9.0,Alexandre QueirÃ³s,13th October 2014,ICN-DXB and DXB-LIS between October 5/6 on economy. Check-in was smooth and simple at ICN. Departed about 10 minutes late but arrived about 20 minutes early. Staff ranged from nice to snippy. Food was good with multiple drinks services in between meals. Noodles were available between meals but didn't see anyone having them. Entertainment system on A380 was state-of-the-art and worked perfectly with countless movies TV shows and albums to pick from. Wi-fi was free on that flight thanks to Eid and worked flawlessly on phone and tablet. Seats comfortable and roomy. Arrival and transfer in DXB was normal. DXB-LIS had an older B777 which is not as good but my window seat was on the back which has a 2-4-2 configuration. Recommend getting a seat on that section as you have more aisle space. Food was better than on the other flight with multiple drinks services in between meals again. Entertainment system is the same but the touch screen wasn't as responsive and software was slightly slower due to age of plane. Staff was nicer and didn't mind engaging in chit-chat with passengers.

The seats are more comfortable, with more shoulder room, and the feeling of more privacy, now that they've gone for more of a cabin feel. the extra storage space for passports, phones, wallets etc. is a welcome addition. The TV screens are large and crisp, in HD (unlike the blurry cumbersome previous screens). Food was of a very good standard, and drinks selection was of a respectable range and standard. Service was friendly and attentive. All in all this is a significantly positive step forwards for Air Canada, despite the flight being late.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,Nicholas Ward,8th October 2018,"Not Verified | Humberside to Sydney via Amsterdam / Abu Dhabi. They simply did not care. I am a gold member of their loyalty program - I booked my flight on the KLM website - after specifically asking questions about benefits privileges and differences - as the flight was a code share - was told there would be no difference. Lie number 1. I booked the ticket and went to book seats online. I could book KLM seats but not partner (the message on screen said seating plan is currently unavailable try later) - Lie number 2. I called after booking to reserve seats and was told I needed to do this with Etihad, I called Etihad and they said it wasnâ€™t possible and I needed to do this with KLM or at the airport: meaning that I would get whatever seat was available 3 hours before the plane would leave - for an 8 hour and a 14 hr flight thatâ€™s just not acceptable - and certainly not like for like with KLM operated flights. When I complained I was told I could cancel my flight at a cost. In the time taken going backwards and forwards between the many KLM service departments other flight costs had risen significantly and I was trapped. After this experience on the way out I asked about upgrades I couldnâ€™t use points for the KLM part and I couldnâ€™t pay for the Etihad part my option was to upgrade to business class which cost more than the original ticket. I have done many long haul flights with various operators - KLM included - some code share some not. I am now sat at the airport waiting for the check in desk to open, I tried on the KLM app where it was not possible, they advised to use the self service at the airport - thatâ€™s not possible. So Iâ€™m sat here until the desks open, thank you KLM. This is not as described when I specifically asked this stuff before booking. The flights in themselves were ok but this level of misinformation and poor customer service is inexcusable.

I am 6'2"" tall and had ample space in comparison with Delta's economy seats. The entertainment system on board was fairly new, all touch screens with an adequate selection of movies, music etc. to keep you busy on a long haul flight.I never find airlines provide you with ""good food"", but I was surprised by the quality of meals onboard, although we were only offered vegetarian pasta or meatballs for lunch. KLM can definitely improve in this area. Snacks were served throughout the flight and I found the snacks to be edible, unlike Delta airlines inflight snacks that normally consist of a green banana and a ham sandwich. Service is the part that impressed me the most. We were greeted by friendly upbeat staff. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and polite. Great job everyone!

Emirates,3.0,Ambika Sharma,6th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates. We fly with them even if it is few hundred dollars expensive or a couple of hours longer journey. Appreciate lovely crews, wifi, comfortable seats and food. However, I found that their connection and transit service is worst (cannot compare with any other airport standard) at Dubai and they donâ€™t respect passengers flying with them in partnership arrangements. Emirates took off 25 min late from SYD. It took additional 20 min to reach to gate at Dubai. Almost 45 min late. Hardly 1 Hr and a bit left for my next flight to KTM. As there was no one waiting at the plane gate, I rushed to Emirates connection centre at Dubai. The response I got there was very upsetting. They were not helping me because my other flight was with flyDubai (which I did not notice earlier as I booked this thru Emirates). Gate number of my flight was not displayed in the Boards. No one helped me, they asked me to wait the gate number to be displayed, which never did. I missed the flight, because the Emirates was late and their information system was not good. They did not bother to help us because we were only 3 passengers in this connection. The following flyDubai flight to KTM was over-booked, so we had to wait next Oman Air flight via Mascot. I reached KTM approx. 18 hrs late to find another surprise. My little suitcase was broken. I made a complain at Sydney and claimed for missing goods.

Emirates,7.0,S Donalla,6th October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dubai to New York JFK. This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent! The aircrew were truly professional and made every effort to accommodate us. Hopefully our next trip with Emirates would be better experience. The weak link as always is the ground staff.

The attendants were forgetful (messed up on our drinks twice and forgot where we sat when we asked for headphones and too chit-chatty among themselves.

United Airlines,1.0,M Kunkel,17th March 2014,On return flight to Denver plane waits for 15 minutes at DIA as ground crew is on break and between shifts even though docking space is open and available for our plane. The one checked bag I had on a direct flight from Calgary did not make the plane even though I arrived for check in at Calgary in plenty of time. As this was a small United plane it was oversold. With so many carry ons checked in below I and multiple other passengers had their luggage shifted to another plane. After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes. When staff finally sashayed out the baggage reps stood for several minutes behind their computers talking to no one. The last 6 United flights in the past year that I and my family have taken have all resulted in some form of delays lost luggage or rude staff. I did not receive my luggage until 50 hours after my flight landed.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no

Flight delays and cancellations have become the rule rather than the exception. I don't usually write reviews, but this particular time I was suppose to fly from Burlington to Washington Dulles, which is considered a short flight. My flight was to leave Burlington at 5:40, with a layover in New York, and get to Virginia at 9am. It is now projected that I will arrive in Virginia at 12-1am. An almost 24 hour delay. I am sorry for the employees who have always been kind and respectful and demonstrated excellent customer service skills. Unfortunately, the frequent, extended delays are ruining the good name of this company.

United Airlines,9.0,B Taggart,13th November 2015,"San Francisco to Orlando. We were surprised how good United Airlines were after reading the reviews. Plane was clean and comfortable and after getting off an 11 hour Air New Zealand long haul flight we were expecting very small cramped seats - but there was not actually a lot of difference between United and Air NZ. What was appreciated was when the cabin crew asked if I would like the three seats behind me and allowed me to move prior to take off. So 6 seats between 3 made it even more comfy. We didn't expect IFE or food so no problems there. Plane departed on time and arrived early. Cabin crew and ground staff all pretty good. I'm taking off a point for no snacks and no IFE but I'm giving a bonus point for friendly cabin crew and generous drink serves.

Qatar Airways,9.0,L Porter,21st August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manila to Manchester via Doha. On the 17th August, Our 2330 pm flight QR929 was canceled. This was because an accident happened a day before when Xiamen Air MF8667 skidded off the runway in a rainy thunderstorm, which led the main runway to be closed. At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently. It took us a while for us to check-in, too crowded, especially with my disabled mom, we got through immigration, security, we finally then got to gates, In an airport, they did not have enough working boards, all of them were not working at all and we couldn't understand where to go at all, except on our ticket, our flight was supposed to depart 1730pm but we departed around 2215pm but I understand, there were too many passengers to handle though. we boarded via stairs and I complained that we did not use a lifter for catering, but that wasn't the airlines' fault though. we got into the cabin my son seated in a different row, while a sat with my mother, the seats were comfortable, the IFE was good, and the food wasn't the best but appetizing, and the staff was very helpful. We landed in Doha, and we missed our 0155 am the QR27 flight to Manchester, they gave us another flight to catch at 0810 am with no fee at all and the expectations were the same as the previous flight.",Boeing 777-300ER / 787-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Manchester via Doha,August 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes

I was told overbooking by 10% was â€œlegalâ€ due to it being the ""high travel season."" After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us. She promised to place us first on a waitlist for the flight we had booked. When we appeared at the departure gate we noticed our names were numbers 18 and 22 on the electronic display of waitlisted passengers. Aeromexico and its staff do not understand customer service.

Emirates,7.0,K Cornelius,6th November 2014,Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Aeromexico,7.0,JosÃ© Maldonado,12th November 2015,"Durango to Monterrey via Mexico City. Nice flight, the only thing that I saw Is when I called to the call center requesting an upgrade 48 hours before the flight (supposedly in a platinum level you can call even 72 hours before the fight in order to request the upgrade) they told me that they had not available spaces for free upgrades. So I could pay for it or I had to wait to be in the flight date at the airline desk in order to ask for it. When I did it, the person at the desk (Durango airport) told me that she had not available seats so anyway I requested her to put me in the waiting list. I was the 3rd passenger that arrived at the airport for that flight (Durango has a small airport and the second passenger is my friend and he didn't requested an upgrade) - she answered yes no problem I will remember you because I will be at the gate collecting the boarding passes. At the boarding time I could see that the lady called anther person that arrived later than me (about three or four persons) and she gave them upgrades - I don't know why she didn't gave it to me even if I arrived before than them. I think you should allow to get an upgrade to any platinum level that calls 72 hours to get an upgrade because we are into the period of time requested by Aeromexico, obviously if there are free seats. Aeromexico should check personnel in land that probably assigning upgrades to friends or people that they know.

Second when your flight is canceled 90 minutes before departure because the aircraft is â€œnot availableâ€ United will never tell you why, so do not ever expect any type of compensation for your loss of time or other expenses.

I asked why I was not offered this flight when I had initially called and I was given the run around. If I cancelled my trip I would not get any money back and would only get a credit.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,N Hartmann,19th January 2015,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,G Wren,27th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines has always been my go-to airline, until today. I recently had to cancel a flight for my husband due to injury about 2 weeks prior to our trip. My husband rarely travels, and I paid for the trip with my credit card which gives us further travel rewards. I was offered travel funds for the cancelled trip, and since I travel all the time planned to use them for a flight for me. What Southwest fails to mention is that the person who paid for the trip is not the one that is allowed to use the funds, its only the ticketed passenger. The lady I spoke to in customer service was extremely rude and told me the policies were clearly stated on the cancellation email (I looked- they are not). It is the worst customer service I have ever experienced from a company to date. I travel a lot and would rather take my business elsewhere then ever deal with such rude, hostile customer service again, especially from a company who prides themselves on transparency when that clearly is not the case! Do not waste your time with this company ever again!

I ended up hanging out in the corner near the gate's counter for about 5 hours, watching the Jetblue employees work. They seemed to be very friendly and accommodating with the flyers and I imagine it was very stressful. After sitting in the corner for 5 hours, one of the Jetblue employees asked to see my ticket and put me in a much better, premium seat and allowed me to board first because he felt bad I had spent so many hours at the gate.

We can understand this the first time, but the second time it happened we didnâ€™t get to choose our food, we felt being treated unfairly, and to us it clearly showed that Lufthansa did not care about attending to customersâ€™ needs and respecting their right of choice. We paid our fares as everyone else! It is not about we really have to have that particular food, itâ€™s about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice.

Lufthansa,9.0,R Nazmul,16th April 2015,ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad.

I was served with a hot towel and was able to watch my a film during take off. After flying for 5 hours I needed my bag with me. Unfortunately it was in the locker which was too high for me to reach so when I saw a flight attendant pass by I asked her if she could help. She helped me open the locker eventually but her attitude left me disappointed! On my way back from DXB to SGN I was lucky to have a lovely flight crew. In general the on board entertainment was very impressive. Even though the hot meals were served quickly they didn't taste good the food was incredibly salty and I couldn't finish it.

Because I paid the cheapest fare, I was one of the last people on. Luckily it wasn't a full flight so I still got an aisle seat. The plane was clean. The flight attendant giving the safety announcement, as per apparent Southwest policy, made the speech into a comedy routine (much needed on a red-eye).

United Airlines,7.0,J Clifford,28th January 2015,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,yes
Delta Air Lines,1.0,E Huang,9th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Pittsburgh operated by Delta. A nightmare. After 21-hour flying from Asia to JFK with my little kids, a 7 year and a 2 year old, we supposed to have only 3 hours layover at JFK and a 2 hour flight to get home. The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care. Seat comfort - small, narrow. Cabin staff service - The only thing they can do is to bring you water.

The aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 reg N78009 and it looked like it was ageing so it was. The seat for 22L was comfortable but as it was a 10-hour flight the extra leg room was worth it for the comfort if you are 6 foot tall like me and it is a good seat as I was happy with the legroom and a good whole window to yourself as seat behind me did not have a window. Despite that, the 20-year-old aircraft (almost as old as I am), the actual flight was smooth no problems was very impressed with the attentiveness of the crew and was well looked after with drinks and snacks for a 10-hour flight.

Noted soft drink or pop as is referred to being poured from cans into plastic cups. Why not provide cans to customers? Air Canada flight attendants very robotic and impersonal.

We booked our flight the morning of Christmas Eve due to work schedules out of california to sunny Las Vegas. The day before our flight we were so excited to know that next morning we would be spending our Christmas Eve with my family. Unfortunately for us our plans changed quickly for the worst. At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasnâ€™t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didnâ€™t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if weâ€™re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldnâ€™t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right. Itâ€™s unfortunate because the weather was perfect out of California and Las Vegas.

Middleton,30th November 2015,"Living in Miami I fly the dreaded American Airlines 95% of the time, but thanks to their unusually high fares this year, and a spate of bad experiences, I switched to Delta for this trip. Unlike AA, I have zero ""privileges"" / status on DL, but even with that the flights were far better than what I have become accustomed to. Boarding on the two outbound and the two return segments went smoothly. Ground staff, and cabin staff were friendly, smiling, and even uttered words like ""please"" and ""thank you,"" which the AA employees forgot sometime back in the 1990s. Their uniforms were neat, clean and pressed. The boarding process, even in ""Zone 2,"" was organized and efficient, again in contrast to the priority boarding / rugby scrum I usually encounter at AA gates in Miami. DL pulls off boarding, somehow, with only one agent, which probably cuts labor costs and frees up more money for amenities like charging stations all over their Atlanta terminals. IS DL up to European or Asian standards? Probably not. But for the money, and a domestic US trip, this was a good value. I'll consider switching again in the future.

Lufthansa,1.0,K Malcom,12th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",CRJ1000 / A320,Business,Business Class,Zagreb to London via Frankfurt,June 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,C Mears,4th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | This flight was a ""United by SkyWest"" Flight From Boise, Idaho to San Francisco and then to Fresno California. The gate operations and boarding went fine in Boise, and we departed on time. The problem started in San Francisco (SFO). When arriving in SFO, the pilot came on the intercom, alerting us to a computer problem ""Only effecting Skywest flights"" and that the plane couldn't, leave the gate since without the computer they couldn't do anything, but don't worry we would have it all cleared up in 20 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, they started to taxi around the tarmac in an effort to look like we were getting somewhere. At 2 hours we did finally get into the gate. We were told that most outbound flights were delayed so, Hurry and get to your gate and you can probably still get your connection. I rushed, I made it onto the plane. After about 20 minutes I noticed that we were not moving. Within a few minutes the flight crew arrives. The pilot announces that since they had been stuck on the Tarmac just like the rest of us, that they were about to ""Time Out:"" and that they were waiting for another flight crew to come aboard so that they could take over in Fresno. A few minutes later they announce that ""The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork."" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don't have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don't know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that ""If You are going to get off Plane do so Now."" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, ""It should be about 20 minutes"". We all had a good laugh. I have never heard passengers catcall the pilot before. Well after another hour (The flight is now 4.5 hours late in departure) they push us back from the gate and start the plane.

My recommendation would be to wait until the plane is ready to go before boarding passengers. There was a few passengers that we're getting impatient and one passenger even had an outburst saying ""who cares about the food, let's just go. Let's Go!""

One of these was an older member of the team who just didn't seem to have the friendly disposition and level of service you would expect when travelling in a premium cabin. The positives were the food and wine which was excellent. The negatives were the bed and the IFE in my seat went unserviceable fortunately there was a vacant seat so I was able to move over to that!

I had the chicken in cream sauce with roasted potato carrot and green bean. Also each tray had a corn and iceberg lettuce salad a white bun and brownie for dessert. It was quite decent for airline food and certainly not the worst I've had travelling. The wine selection was decent too. At the halfway point a Nissin cup of noodles were served with a chicken finger sandwich on white bread with a pack of biscuits.

Went back to customer service and they told me the next available flight was the one they had given me in the first place. I went online to the Air Canada website and searched earlier flights and there was one 5 hours earlier that they were still selling tickets for. I queried this with customer services advisor and he said it was overbooked by 16 seats, yet they were still selling tickets for $5000 online? He told me that I could book a ticket online if I wanted to pay that much but he couldn't put me on that flight. It's ok though because they gave me a $15 meal voucher to apologise for my 15 hour wait in the airport. What an absolute joke. Best part of the journey was the hotel I was put up in, despite only being in there for 3 hours.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to London via Toronto,August 2017,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no

Lufthansa,9.0,K Steensen,16th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Copenhagen to Houston via Frankfurt. This is my first long haul trip with Lufthansa after many successful short haul flights with them over the past couple of years. I have to praise them for a great experience, from booking, through check in to the flight itself. We sat on the top deck at the very back, economy on the top deck of Lufthansa is a small cabin with 5-6 rows so it felt very private and service was also very efficient and fast although there was only one cabin crew. As a 182 tall guy I found the seats to be the most comfortable economy seats I have sat in as my knees didn't touch the seat in front and I could stretch my legs comfortably underneath the seat in front. Crew came round with water/juice every half hour, and in between the galley was open and you could help yourself to soft drinks or even request beer/wine. The crew were excellent, and from this return trip I can understand why LH has earned the 5 star status.",A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Houston via Frankfurt,November 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes

As an American citizen traveling domestically, over the past 15 years, I've come to set the bar about as low as it can get for flying. That said, I will never fly United Airlines again. Enough is enough. My boyfriend and I had pre-selected our seats, yet did not have seat assignments after checking in. It's the holidays, so lines were long at check in. There was a woman in line with several suitcases, two of which were less than 4lbs over the weight limit. Instead of just taking pity on her and expediting the line by accepting her suitcases on the first, second, third and fourth times she repacked them, employees felt it was a better option to continue to hold up the line and create confusion as she kept having to drag her suitcases back and forth. Know when to just cut your losses. Because of the seating issue I was not able to sit with my boyfriend on the second flight. Upon landing, we learned that one of our suitcases was not on the plane, leaving my boyfriend with none of his things. We were told that it would be delivered to our hotel (2 hours away) by the end of the day. I am sceptical, but will see. My own brand new suitcase's retractable handle is now completely broken and won't budge from its retracted position. I was curtly informed that they are not liable for this damage. I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back, so it's very uncomfortable if not painful to try and drag my suitcase around without a retractable handle. So thanks a lot for that, United.

United Airlines,2.0,Hazar Alsabagh,23rd March 2016,"I was scheduled to fly to Providence through Newark on March 17 2016. My first flight was from Toronto to Newark at 11:05AM. I arrived to the airport at 9am, and so I had an hour before the gates closed. Unfortunately it took 40 mins to find parking, and by the time I got to the check-in, I had 15 mins to spare. There was an agent chatting and paying no attention to customers, so given I had very little time left, I thought I'd use the self check-in machine. Those machines are not very user friendly at all! It wouldn't recognize the name of the city where I was staying and the name of the hotel. I was timed-out after trying 3 times, and only when I exasperated loudly did the check-in lady look up and nonchalantly say, ""If you're having trouble go over there."" Over there was the other end of the booths, where an agent seemed oblivious to her surroundings. By the time I rushed to her and handed my passport, she told me that I was late and wasn't going anywhere. Then she pointed out that I had a checked bag and so I was definitely not getting on this flight. I raised my voice out of despair, and explained to her that I had spent 15 minutes trying to figure out their machines. I was even the one who ""apologized"" saying it wasn't her fault. Instead of her apologizing for being inconvenienced by the airlines for whom she works, she had the nerve to look up at the other agent and ask her if I was telling the truth! She then told me she could get me on a flight that'll get me to Providence by 11:55PM. That's when I told I needed to be there in the afternoon because I had a rental. Of course, she wouldn't override the system and open the gate, claiming it was too late even though it was an hour before boarding.

I belong to their 1K frequent flyers. Among my many United flights I have randomly picked this one as an example. The airline has gone through many rough patches over the last couple of years. Poor management has led to very poor performance by the company as a whole. Unmotivated front-line employees, unresponsive customer service agents, older dirty planes remain a hallmark of United. Recently, the company has revamped their lagging international business class but the nicer pillows and blankets are not enough to cover up the many other deficiencies. The flight discribed here was a case in point: tired flight attendants, delays, lost luggage, helpless customer service agents lying about measures taken. This flight had all of the catastrophes that I have come to expect from United Airlines. Many people and United employees were hoping that a new CEO could turn things around. It didn't happen and in fact United continues on a downward spiral with no end in sight.

American Airlines,1.0,J Meares,8th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | This wasn't my first time flying with American airlines but it will definitely be my last. For starters, I have had more than one bad experience with them. This time, I was flying from Lafayette to a connecting flight in Dallas and then to Toronto. I always check my flight status ahead of time and there were no reported delays or changes. But for some reason, the agent at the boarding gate in Lafayette was not letting us board at our scheduled time. They gave us no information as to why we were waiting and told us we would be boarding shortly. Well, 'shortly' became at least 40 minutes. After landing in Dallas, my party and I found out the gate and terminal had changed from what was on our boarding passes and switched to the other side of the airport. After running through the crowded hallways and shouting apologies we made it to our gate which was already closed and unstaffed, about 10 minutes before our scheduled flight. At the next American airlines customer assistance counter, we were told the next available flight would be the next day. Myself and at least 10 other customers were trying to figure out how this happened as we all arrived to our first flight well ahead of the scheduled time. The agents at the service counter were saying it was coded in the system as 'delayed due to weather' ... but why then were the other similar flights, one of which departing just 10 minutes before ours, not also delayed due to weather...? How was this one flight in particular the only one delayed due to weather? Why was the online flight tracker not updated? And why was it listing our first plane as 'landed on time' in Lafayette... ? We took a step aside, and called the customer assistance number and agents over the phone were saying there was no reason listed for the delay. I took my phone back to the counter and had both agents speak to each other, who could not agree on the information they each had available. After they decided to agree-to-disagree, they informed us that their policy does not offer any accommodations for room, food or necessities. We were told the reason being that it was coded as a weather delay... Now, I was never rude or took a tone with the service agents, but they were still not helpful or empathetic to the situation, I guess they are just too used to delivering bad news. They also never offered any information about the area such as what hotels are nearby, even after we asked. At this point, I asked for a supervisor who could offer more assistance in this area, yet we were told that a supervisor would tell us the same thing, and we would be 'wasting our breath'. The only alternative we were offered was the website to American airlines, where we could send an email. This whole experience has left me quite skeptical about the information being given from American Airline and its service agents, who may use these 'codes' to protect themselves from obligations and policies they advertise to its customers. Please consider my experience as a warning for anyone looking to book any flights with AA online, and please exercise caution especially when booking connecting flights with them as they allow a minimum window of 30 minutes between connecting flights and will not accommodate you if your next flight is missed, even if they are solely responsible and the situation is out of your control.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lafayette to Toronto,March 2019,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,E Terry,13th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City via Denver. Did somebody shrink the size of the international carry on size? Or is it just United Airlines? Wouldn't let us bring our carry on as it didn't fit in their sample carry on box. It fit in Southwest's just fine. Non-existent customer service. We were not rude, just asked why it was small compared the other airlines. Not even about the 25$. Just tired of dealing with people trying to nickle and dime. Thought for a minute I was dealing with dish network or comcast.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,V Ozan,8th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I often fly Turkish Airlines economy class, but this time I flew business class Istanbul-Riga-Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is my favorite airline, but business class exceeded all my expectations. In Istanbul Ataturk airport I could check-in and use the business class passage for migration/security control - which is very valuable in such a busy and crowded airport. Moreover, Turkish Airlines lounge is free of charge for business class passengers. The seats in the business class are wide and comfortable with ability to transform a seat to bed-like resting position. The in-flight entertainment is wonderful - from many new movies, channels, series, etc. Inflight service is excellent with very attentive flight attendants. The meal service was simply fantastic - bext to appetizers, there is a selection of 3 possible main course choices (but I did not like any of them (veal, shrimp, vegetarian), so I was offered extra choice of chicken - to my own surprise). I highly recommend this airline even with economy clas, and its business class is a delight.",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,RIX to IST,July 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,J Gansen,9th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Helsinki to Amsterdam. My first experience with KLM was about 2 years ago ( AMS-Malaga & return ) and it was horrible. On May 1 I was re-booked by Finnair to fly with KLM due to a delayed flight from BKK. On board food was tasteless plus a horrible service provided. Had 1 hr 40 minutes lay over in HEL which I thought more than enough time to transfer my luggage from Finnair to KLM aircraft but it did not. Claim missing luggage report made at KLM arrival service desk at Schiphol, they sent me to Swissport office at arrival to make my report despite flying in their KLM aircraft. Was very nice of Swissport staff escorted me back to KLM desk and explained to them that it is their responsibility for this loss but they refused at first.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,6.0,S Fedichkin,15th May 2014,SVO to MUC and back. Two-hour delay of the flight from Moscow due to military parade and air space closure - no fault of the airline. But the boarding process could and should have been organized in a better way. Wonder why the jetbridge hasn't been used. No such problems on the return flight. Both flights on A320 pretty comfortable seats decent space. Training of the staff should clearly be improved first and foremost the language skills and attitude towards passengers. At the same time a young flight assistant on the return flight at least tried to be friendly and attentive. The food was inedible on the first flight and acceptable on the way back. Entertainment should be enhanced ie. by installation of individual multimedia sets in short and medium-haul aircrafts. All in all the general experience is pretty average. The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile. Also basing on my experience of traveling with this airline I can say that the quality of in-flight service can differ dramatically on different flights so it is sometimes really a matter of luck.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,yes

The reason I booked this flight was because I couldn't afford anything more, however now all the flights are more expensive. now I have tried to rebook for a different weekend and the ticket is 40 dollars more. After trying to figure out how to enter my credit number in online I was lost and frustrated. Called the company and can only do it over the phone, and now was forced to pay an additional 20$ to the 40$ increase already, to a ""main cabin fee"" vs basic economy(which I originally purchased) because it is their policy. After much complaining and speaking with supervisors I was finally given the basic economy price-still 40$ more than my originally purchased ticket.

This was very marked on my last flight from Istanbul to Birmingham. The seat I has was almost worn out and very uncomfortable. The cabin service was poor. They offer a choice of meals but do carry enough of the options to provide choice to all.

I was supposed to fly out on Dec 27th, but due to weather conditions, the airline kept pushing back the flight times. This is understandable, however the updates were coming sluggishly and unapologetically. After being in the airport since 12 for a 1.30 flight, at 4 I rebooked my flight for today at 5am. It took about 35 min for a very disgruntled worker to even attend to me while I was waiting to try and retrieve me already checked bag. At 4am I arrive at GRK, Killeen Airport and and told by the very rude, digruntled lady (from yesterday) that my 5am flight has been canceled and the next flight isn't until 12 midday. She was unapologetic and very rude. This airport predominately serves the Army community and it is sad that we are subjected to such treatment. Many of us are not afforded the opportunity to go on leave frequently or for lengthy amounts of time, so these delays are crucial. I think the service rendered by American Airlines is disheartening.

We sat on the plane on the tarmac for two and a bit hours because they lost an oxygen tank and couldn't find a new one. They then cancelled our flight and stuck us back in the terminal. Then the heavens opened. Obviously the best option was to stick 200 grumpy passengers outside in the thunder, lightning and rain. Next, they took us 4 at a time in taxis to an hotel. My wife and I were put into what appeared to be the remnant of a much hated Toyota Corrolla. We hung out there for a bit with a guy who spoke no English whatsoever. Once he left us alone in his car and we realised we were going nowhere we accosted a man with a Turkish airlines jacket in a dark car park (still raining). He put us on a bus which proceeded to tour Niamey at 3:00am with the AC on full blast which helped our wet cloths become much more effective in helping us contract some illness. Finally after messing about for a total 6 hours, at 4:00am we got a hotel which makes faulty towers look like New York's Waldorf hotel. There we were left in the hands of the Receptionist. What he lacked linguist ability and clarity of speech he made for in volume and repetition. Needless to say information about our fate was lacking. At around around 7:30am a rumour spread that our suffering may end by 8:00pm that evening. Finally at 8:00pm we were herded into a bus and taken to the airport. There, the Turkish Airlines staff directed us to line up and walk around Niamey airport. At the departure gate our boarding passes and baggage tags were handed out. Once we finally boarded the aircraft most of us passed out with exhaustion for the rest of our journey.

Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive, the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge.

The New York to Rome flight meal service consisted of dessicated pasta and a couscous salad. No vegetables, no cheese, and a stale roll. We thought it was because of an American supplier that didn't understand that this would be an unacceptable meal for an Italian. We were wrong. On the return flight we had a two-pasta combination which was terrible, and a salad of rice. Before landing, we were served an anemic muffin with no butter or jelly.

Emirates,1.0,Alan Millward,18th May 2014,MAD-DXB-BKK Business Class (Frequent Flyer Gold Card holder) traveling approximately bi-monthly for over two years. I've noticed a marked deterioration in quality on this service and my last two flights have had problems which need bringing to the attention of a wider audience. I note from comments on this site that others have noted a similar deterioration in service on Emirates. On the first flight I was double charged by the airline. When I pointed this out to the Service Center I was initially told I was incorrect. After a second e-mail and a delay I was informed by another individual I had to prove that I had been overcharged. When I did this I was then told by a third employee to enter certain information via the web to obtain a refund. I tried several times but the information was clearly wrong. After a further delay a fourth employee suggested I was entering the data incorrectly. I tried again: same result. I then asked the matter to be escalated. No reply. Eventually after further e-mails a fifth employee agreed that the matter should be escalated. Over a month later I received an incomplete refund and a lame excuse for an apology. On my last flight EK385 the service was awful. My breakfast was initially not delivered. After trying to attract the attention of staff my meal some 45 minutes late was slammed down,,,,,,,,,,,,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,E Saliker,1st December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to Munich via Amsterdam. I am really disappointed about yesterdays behaviour of KLM. I was supposed to fly out from Singapore at 1:30 on December 1st. On November 30st around 7pm, so just a few hours before the flight I checked my e-mail (I was lucky because I checked them already a few hours before and didnâ€™t see any KLM e-mail) and saw a mail by KLM saying that my flight has been cancelled and that I have been booked on a flight at 1.35pm on December 1st! So what? Is this even legal? My husband (booked on the same flight) called KLM and because we had to be home within noon on December 1st, they booked us on a Emirates flight via Dubai on 9pm on November 30st. We almost didnâ€™t make it to the check in, couldnâ€™t get seats next to each other anymore. So how is this working: they just send a mail, hoping people are just accepting the change? How about plans, unbooked hotels etc - if I hadnâ€™t checked my mails, where we supposed to sleep on the airport? How about plans when getting home? This is completely unprofessional and unacceptable!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Munich via Amsterdam,November 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,C Heaney,3rd April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to Washington. I had the worst customer service experience of my life today, which resulted in missing my flight with my husband and infant. We arrived more than 90 minutes prior to our flight out of Miami but were unable to check in via computer because my husband and child have the same names. We paid for our baby to have his own seat which the computer couldnâ€™t figure out. The airline doesnâ€™t employ enough staff to have anyone to help with the computer kiosks, so we had to wait in a long, slow line to speak to a person. 45 minutes later, we dealt with an agent who was extremely rude and unhelpful. She said it was too late to check bags, so my husband had to leave the airport with our checked bags while I did my best with a long security line. I asked if I could be moved through quicker. One agent said yes and another said no. I wasnâ€™t able to get rushed through, even though I informed security that I would likely miss my flight. I had to sprint through the airport to my gate with a crying baby, only to find that the gate had been closed. The attendant said she would â€œcheck to seeâ€ if we could still get on, but I saw her from the window chatting with other people while the plane started rolling away from the gate. I approached customer service about this and said I had to get back to the DC area tonight. The woman said there were â€œno available flights tonightâ€ even though I found one online with a seat in first class. She didnâ€™t even give me the option to pay extra for that.

Emirates,1.0,H Zareed,10th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! So I submitted a complaint, and asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back. Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do - otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.",,Business,Economy Class,Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Turkish Airlines,1.0,Evangelos Zafeiratos,4th January 2016,"Flight from Istanbul to Athens on Sunday 12.05, I was unable to use the Automatic check-in, because there was an error message ""No Seats Available"". A kind employee suggested that I should ask at the Administration desks, where of course there were more people waiting from different flights with all kinds of problems, due to the bad weather and cancellations. After about 35 mins, I gave my ID and I was told, even without apologies, that my possibilities to board were 50-50, because I was late to check-in, and there were some extra tickets sold. Further explanations were not given, but my guess is that they thought on this bad weather some people will not make it to the airport (as it happened ) so why can't we sell some extra tickets for more profit? I arrived at the gate and I gave my non-seat Boarding Pass, and I was been told to wait. I discovered that there were 3 more people with the same problem as mine. After the last passenger boarded, we would have to take the bus leading to the airplane, and wait again, until all passengers were counted, so they were making sure that there were available seats. Finally, we were told to enter the plane and take our seats, but this unrest is not justified by an airline such as the one I used.

So 10 hours in airports to go to a place that would have taken me 8 hours to drive to. If I fly a discounted airline I expect this type of service because you get what you pay for but United although gives cut rate service their prices are not cut rate.

I can care less about food, chairs or even the way the flight crew treats passengers but donâ€™t charge me to get to a destination that I could have driven to in a lot less time. I will be asking for some money back. Not a voucher either because I will never take united again unlesss I have a sudden urge to spend a whole day in the airport.

United Airlines,1.0,Melissa Goldsmith,23rd August 2016,"I had a horrible experience with United Airlines and will not be flying with them again. The staff were rude at all encounters. Firstly, I was told the cabin was too full for my carry-on bag so I had to give it to a crew member to put it with the checked baggage. My connecting flight from Newark to Halifax was cancelled until the next day due to the weather. We stood in a line for an hour and half to talk to an incredibly rude staff member, who told us they would do nothing to help accommodate us for the night of expenses. They refused to return my checked luggage to me which I needed, and assured me it would be on my flight the next day. When we were on the flight the next day going to Halifax, we paid the fee to rent a movie, as United Airlines does not provide free movies like other airlines. We then found out that even if you pay you cannot start at the beginning of the movie, you start wherever the movie is at, as they run on a repeating cycle. Therefore we accidentally watched the last 5 minutes of the movie we paid to see. Also want to mention that of the four planes taken on this trip only one had a TV which was not free. Two of these flights were two hours long and two were five hours long. United Airlines also advertises free wifi on the plane, which doesn't work.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,C Per,23rd January 2011,My first experience with Aeroflot has been really awful. December 26th Moscow Sheremetyevo to Beijing but due to the bad weather many flights including mine are cancelled. Aeroflot is unable to cope with the passengers requests for clarification and the assistant who manages the Transit office is only able to say that she cannot tell anything to anybody and that passengers should just hear the announcements and watch the displays. Needless to say the announcements are barely audible and spoken in a language which hardly resembles English and the displays report incorrect information. We happen to discover by chance that Aeroflot dispenses meal vouchers which passengers are able to receive only after long and exhausting queues. The worst part is when the flight Moscow-Beijing is actually announced at 1630 on December 27th. No information is given as to who is allowed to access the airplane and this causes chaos at the gate. After some time rumors spread that only passengers with a ticket for Dec 27th flight will be admitted as well as some people with the ticket for the Dec 26th flight. After a couple of hours in wait at the gate an announcement of an Air China flight to Beijing has the result to disperse part of the crowd mostly Chinese but when we go to the gate joining the others we notice that the monitor at the gate reports a flight to Antalya. Therefore we go back to the Moscow-Beijing gate and after pushing and shoving we are admitted into the airplane with no apparent logic while other passengers are left behind.

I was supposed to fly from Newark to Miami on May 15. Due to some of the weather we were experiencing united sent out an email stating that I was able to change my flight to an earlier flight or later flight because my flight would more than likely be delayed and or canceled. In this email it also stated that I was able to change my seat for free as long as it was in the same class cabin (economy-economy plus). I then called United to have my flight changed which would in turn change my seat. I was flying economy but the only available seats were for economy plus however that did not matter because United said that they would waive any change fees and any seat change fees. When I called to try and have my flight changed I was spoke into extremely nasty, I was told I didnâ€™t know what I was talking about, and I was told ""thatâ€™s just how it is"", when I try to explain that United had already waived the change fee for the seat and customer service was still trying to charge me $150. I was determined to get on this flight as my scheduled flight was already delayed five hours. The flight I was trying to get on was delayed an hour. I did not give up as I went to the airport went through TSA and got to my gate. I had to physically show the email to her United worker to get them to believe me. I do not understand how the company is not in sync with their employees. How are you sending out mass emails that your own employees donâ€™t know about it makes no sense at all.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Simon Summers,13th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet.

On return day AIT to RAR ANZ pilot took ill so we were forced to layover a night in Raro. After waiting over 4 hours at Raro airport for ANZ staff to appear ANZ proved totally inattentive to our needs making us wait in the dark literally and then they refused to pay for our dinner that night (we ate it too early 7pm) and staff didn't arrive at airport until 9pm) when we knew well before ANZ staff appeared at the airport that we needed to eat because there would be no ""on-board"" service that evening.

Emirates,3.0,S Lurinah,15th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | London Heathrow to Dubai. Had heard great things about the airline and my wife and I were looking forward to the flight/holiday. What a disappointment. The headphone jack was not working, the recline button on my seat was not working. The seat itself was not completely fixed. It kept slipping. When the food arrived, my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasn't even hot. Some passengers could not have their first choice meal. When we landed in Dubai, we had to be bussed to the terminal. The return flight was worse. Seating in the middle of the middle row (seats E/F) is definitely a mistake. The cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. They kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. (we only wanted a cup of tea!). They even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. There was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. We found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional. All in all, a pretty disappointing experience. The A380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but I feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry. Will only use this airline if I really have too. We had a wonderful holiday in Dubai but the return flight left a bad taste in the mouth.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to DXB,November 2016,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,no

Our connecting flight in ATL was delayed due to a scheduling error by the airline. Once that was resolved we got on the plane, but were again delayed. We sat on the tarmac for 2 hrs before the plane returned to the gate due to a mechanical error. By now it was nearly midnight. Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 9:15 pm. We were then told no flight was available til 7:00 am the next day and weâ€™d be given hotel vouchers, but would need to be back at the airport by 5:00 am. The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude.

Emirates,6.0,Sjoholm Magnus,9th January 2014,In December I flew Emirates on 4 different occasions from Copenhagen to Dubai/Bangkok and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. The most annoying was the slow and confusing service of the cabin crew it took more than 2 hours for them to serve anything on each of the flights and it seemed like they were all trainees. On the first flight we had great large new screens for the inflight entertainment system but on the other flights the planes were equipped with an earlier version which was not at all as good. The check in and boarding procedures worked fine although there are always a lot of people who don't understand the boarding priorities. The food and beverage were of average quality and you more or less had to go and ask for the drinks by yourself. I will travel with Emirates again if I will get a good price but not for the comfort and service level.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Probably. But after they closed the gate, we stood on runway for an hour and a half. Getting to airport, passing security is already stressful enough, do they have to add to aggregation?

American Airlines,3.0,E Lydon,28th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | After a bad flight experience with American Airlines 3 years ago, I was pretty hesitant to fly with American again but it was the best option for my needs and I believe in second chances. I arrived in Washington DC at IAD 2 hours before my 7.20 am flight to find that it had been delayed to 10.30 am and my connecting flight in Dallas had subsequently been changed to accommodate for the delay. Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers? The only saving grace in this story is the employee at the gate counter. Without her help I would have certainly missed my connection, but because of her tremendous efforts I was able to make my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Of course, the trip home wasn't quite as terrible, but again I only had one hour to catch my connection and the flight leaving Oklahoma City was 30 minutes late and again I made my connection by 5 minutes. The flights themselves weren't worse or better than average and there are some very helpful employees, but I'm going to steer clear from American Airlines from now on.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Oklahoma City,June 2017,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,no

We left home at noon on Thursday, with an expected arrival time in Greensboro of 6:45pm Thursday - tickets for a concert Friday night. In Toronto, we pulled away from the gate on time, and sat on the runway for over 90 minutes, with the pilot telling us periodically that there was ""bad"" turbulence in Washington, and we'd be advised as soon as he heard anything. After 90 minutes, he turned back to the gate for refueling without having heard anything more. Some passengers were able to get rerouted immediately but the ground crew told us no issues - if there was bad turbulence, our connections would be backed up too. After 45m on the ground we went back out and eventually landed at Dulles. But our connecting flights had all left, so waited another 45m to get an alternate flight (Friday at noon). CSR said the issue was air traffic, not turbulence, so not their problem that we haven't any place to stay here and an expensive, paid-for hotel room waiting for us in Greensboro. After being questioned more insistently, the CSR grudgingly gave us a voucher that got us a discounted (not free!) hotel room. Back to the airport today - at 10:30, 11, 11:30, the board still showed our flight as ""on time"". After the scheduled boarding time of noon came and went, checked with the gate agent - flight is now delayed to 3pm.

I looked online and saw there were seats for another flight through Chicago and went back to request that, only arriving 3 hours late. This bored agent (not harried, there order for agents and me) said that their policy now was to when we re route through the same exact points so I was stuck on the next direct flight and could not be rerouted. But either way one of them was lying through to me. The 2nd agent refused to fly me on the much more convenient flight she just said deadpan, ""welcome to the new American Airlines."" At least I am making my flight on the much later one on a rickety old US Airways plane which are prone to frequent breakdowns, which is why I refused to fly them before. 4-6 hour delays were too common. I can always hope for a upgrade to first class, however on these planes, the first class on domestic flights is like 1985 economy deluxe.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,D Stewart,26th August 2014,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no

On the flight out, the plane pulled away from the gate on time, only to sit on the tarmac for an hour so they could complete a repair. But of course, this was considered an ""on time departure"". On the return flight, the captain informed us that something was dropped under the captains chair, and they had to remove the chair and an access panel to retrieve it. I kid you not. After 45 minutes the captain came out of the cockpit, picked up the intercom, and with a grin on his face, showed the entire passenger area the item that was retrieved, a cupholder. Just great.

United Airlines,1.0,Cassandra Leen,14th April 2015,I was very disappointed with the service and overall experience I received from this airline I had a flight out of Fort Lauderdale Airport at 7.45 am I had arrived early around 6 am with my 4 month old infant. We boarded the flight on time everything seemed to be going as planned until the flight was delayed due to some electrical in the control panel. We ended up sitting on this flight for a good 2 hours waiting as they kept saying sorry and we will update you more in 5 minutes and then 30 minutes and overall a 2 hour wait time until they said we are sorry but we must all exit the plane and wait in line until we could get booked for another flight. Once booked for a new flight they gave us food vouchers the new flight they booked me on was at 2.55pm it was only 11am so I was expected to wait with an infant for another 3 hours - a long day waiting me with my son. I then received a notification on my phone that the flight they rebooked me on had been delayed 90 minutes which would have meant being stuck in Houston airport where my connecting flight was but that I would have missed by the time the new flight had arrived. I was then put on another flight leaving Fort Lauderdale at 5.15pm and arriving to my destination at 11.18pm.

Emirates,2.0,Paul Bryde,14th September 2015,"I changed my Emirates flight to a late flight departing Athens at 22.20 and arriving into Dubai at 03.50, because there was First Class offered on this extra service and according to my reservation the aircraft was a Boeing 777LR with closed suites. The morning of my departure I was disappointed to find that the aircraft had been changed to an A330 with only sleeper seats. I have never traveled on an Emirates A330, so I had no idea what the seats would be like. On boarding the aircraft I was horrified to find that the seats were not even angle lie flat seats, in fact the seats could hardly recline more than a business class seat on a domestic route. Whilst I understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route, how Emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what I expect when paying a First Class fare. On top of that whilst there was many empty gates on arrival at DXB we were places on a stand far away from the terminal.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Frank Castro,4th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Austin to Houston. This trip which ended in Alabama was the most horrible experience Iâ€™ve had in all the years of traveling first the company that I went to work for chose the least expensive way to get me to the location. When I boarded the plane I was wearing a leather jacket that was owned by my stepfather who had passed away it was handed down to me for years. I had admired this jacket and I decided to take it with me for good luck at my sales event however it was rather bulky so when I got on the plane they were full and the airline stewardess asked if I would put the jacket in the above head storage. Iâ€™ve heard horror stories of arguing with a flight attendant and have seen too many movies so I complied and put it in the overhead bin. However I did not realize of the seating arrangements which is open seating when you get on the plane so the only seats that were available were the center seats which left me at a disadvantage where I couldnâ€™t see the overhead bin that my jacket was it So when we landed I had to wait for everyone to move in order to get out of my seat and by the time I got to the bin where my jacket was to be it was gone I of course did not get upset because again did not want to be escorted off the plane so I asked as I got off about my jacket they said they would check on it once I get off. I waited about 15 minutes or so no one came out finally someone came out and said they could not find my jacket and that I would have to report it online because they had no one there to take the report which I thought was odd as a customer service gesture. When I finally spoke to them they told me that I need to report it online, after I done so all I heard from them is we havenâ€™t found it we havenâ€™t found it to this day. I have not heard from them again itâ€™s as if they donâ€™t care what happens to your belongings and they have no sense of responsibility how sad for the general public",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Houston,April 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,no

The trip back was a different matter. Centre aisle seat and very hard and uncomfortable. Unfriendly Air Hostesses who were abrupt and absolutely no help whatsoever. I apparently tried to use the wrong bathroom and was told in no uncertain terms it wasn't for me and to use the other one. This left me feeling like a 5yo who had just been told off by his mother, no courtesy at all. Then the meal announcements which they announced wrong 4 times before getting it right. And it's pronounced rat-a-tooy not rat-a-tooly. The NZ accent was so bad I wanted to shrink into my seat, a 14yo old school girl would sound better. I was absolutely embarrassed. Then at 6am offering coffee service but when I ordered it (which was as soon as it appeared on my screen) I was informed the kitchen was closed. Are you kidding me, what kitchen would that be? It's a coffee pot! I realised then I had not seen one person served anything at all besides the meal. Get rid these lazy over paid idiots, sack your trainer and start looking at other airlines to see what service is all about. Time to ditch the hokey kiwi manner and accent, get professional Air NZ.

I abstained from speaking to the people on the flight and the people at the front desk at the airport, as I know they do not have any say as to what was happening. This flight experience was poorly addressed and handled and the small $400 credit they sent in an email I do not feel is suitable compensation. Due to the lack of the airline getting me back to Phoenix on-time, I had to miss an important meeting with my business consultant that flew in from Maryland to meet with me. This cost me far more than $400! Not only that, the airline did not start telling people they would put them up in a hotel until 11pm, after they had us sitting on the runway for 4 hours! I had already left and checked in to the Comfort Inn and Suites, which they did reimburse me for after I wrote about my experience to their customer service. This delay had nothing to due with weather, it had to due with the poor scheduling of pilots on the plane that were ended up not being able to fly because their flight time ran out while we sat on the runway waiting for take-off! Absolutely horrible experience and their customer service continued to give me the same run around emails and they even had other people email me claiming they were supervisors and stating the exact same regards for my poor experience but there is nothing else they can do and they feel they have already compensated me fairly with their pathetic $400 credit.",,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Phoenix,February 2019,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Aegean Airlines,10.0,D Lee,20th May 2015,Athens-Prague on 11 May. Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available. Arrival into Prague on time and bags were processed within 15 minutes after leaving the aircraft.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,P Lane,8th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Nashville to San Francisco via Salt Lake City. Where to start, we got to Nashville airport with 2 check in bags each (3 of us traveling) and thought it would be easier to check in at the road side counter. The guy there weighed all our bags and then said 'come around this side of the counter and see the total cost for your bags', it was a total of $480 USD for the 6 bags. Now mind you we weighed all our bags before getting to the airport, they were on the limit yes, but he tried to say 1 was close to 60 pound. He then said he would make them all go through for the usual $30 per bag if we 'look after him', so we had to pay him cash (he had a massive amount of cash in his pocket) not so sure if this is Deltas policy. Onboard our leg from SLC to San Fran we asked for a beverage in which we were charged for. We were in Comfort + seating which clearly states on their website and in their brochure in the back of the seat that all drinks including alcohol are free. When asking if this is the case we got a little chuckle and 'argh no mam, no they're not included' and he proceeded to charge us. After re reading the brochure I asked the other attendant who looked at me blankly and said 'yes that's right they're included'. I advised him that his colleague doesn't know this and he has been charging all of us for what's supposed to be included. He had to go and refund everyone one by one. Then to top it off we get to San Francisco airport, get our luggage and my sister in laws brand new Jeep suitcase is distroyed. Literally falling apart. Looks like it had been run over. So off we go to luggage counter and the lady there - while chewing on a lollie - looks at us like we're morons and says 'oh I can get you another one but it won't be a Jeep one sorry'.

When I went in to make a matching reservation the site stated a change had been made to my itinerary and to give them a call. When I gave them a call they said I had to pay $300 more for my ticket, they also wanted me to pay a change fee. This is not right, I did not cancel my ticket, they cancelled my ticket and I should not have to pay more when they changed my ticket and I had no say at all. I switched from Southwest to United about two years ago because I thought I got better Customer Service and flights, I was wrong, United has continually gone downhill in the last two years and I will be switching back to Southwest and any over seas travel will not be on United.

Air Canada,3.0,W Bohlen,2nd January 2014,Flight from Vancouver to Brisbane. We paid extra for exit seats to get extra legroom. At Vancouver airport we were given our boarding passes and found we were sitting nowhere near our paid seats and not even sitting together. We complained at the counter and a very rude woman behind the counter said that that was tough luck. Lots of other passengers were complaining about the same thing. I kept complaining long enough so we eventually got the seats we paid extra for. The food on the flight was just horrible and nobody could guess what it was it was just stodge. FA's were rude and unhelpful. The plane was old the seats uncomfortable for a 15 hour flight. It was however cheap.

United Airlines,1.0,T Weiman,28th October 2014,2014 Platinum flyer and 1M United Flyer. Flew last night on UA Flight 1430 between Orange County CA and Chicago O'hare. Seated in center of 8th row. 1 row off bulkhead. About an hour before the landing the flight attendants came through with another beverage service. After they had passed I asked my row mates to let me out to use the rest room. The isle to the rear of the plane was blocked by the cart. I proceeded forward to the forward rest room where I was stopped by the male flight attendant serving first class. He indicated that I needed to return to coach and to the rear of the plane to use those restrooms. I indicated to him that the aisle was filled with the cart and the forward restroom was the only one I could get to. He again indicated to me to return to the rear of the plane. I told him I would not and proceeded by him and used the rest room. Behind me was my row mate (first met him on the plane) who is a 2014 1K member. The flight attendant told him he could not use the rest room also he proceeded by him too.

I ordered a lacto-ovo diet and in my past experience, I was given sandwich and some dessert/cake, however this time I was a bit disappointed that I was only given 1 piece of vegetarian rolls. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing, and the best onboard breakfast that I have had. Emirates also provide stickers so flight attendants know whether to wake up or not. Inflight entertainment was superb, plenty of choices and the front/bottom aircraft camera view was available. The ICE on this aircraft hasn't been upgraded yet (wasn't ICE widescreen) but still enjoyable. Wi-fi was also available in this flight for those who prefer browsing to watching the IFE, and the connection speed was pretty fast. Apart from during take off and landing, mobile phone were allowed to be used onboard. The seat was comfortable and the headrest is adjustable. Flight attendants were friendly.

Though UA ground staff at check in counter were quite helpful they couldn't do anything except asking me to go to boarding gate and wait the problem to be resolved there. I was told UA does overbooking in all classes. I was looking forward to this flight enroute in First Class as I was connecting to BKK hence I wanted to relax. Alas I wasn't able to relax as I had to ask UA team for every 10 minutes for an update. Finally after a long argument with the gate staff I was given a a First Class seat by an arrogant lady who made one feel that she did me a great favor although it was within my right.

This was a mixed Business/Economy fare (which was really good value) with Sydney to Doha in Business and Economy onwards to Vienna and the same back to Doha from London. I unwittingly got to travel in all three classes and can only say positive things about this airline. Business Class from Sydney to Doha was great really nice cabin and seat, well thought out with loads of storage space. The wine selection was also outstanding (I am a wine buff), food a bit more average. A really good flight and the lounge in Doha is excellent, if a little hard to find. Business felt like a real 'treat' and was a really nice way to start a holiday. Economy to and from Europe was decent enough - but especially coming back in the A380. Try and get a seat upstairs at the back of Business - small cabin with it's own toilets and only about 8-10 rows. I managed to score the front row so had heaps of leg room. From Doha back to Sydney they upgraded me to First from Business - what a treat! The Krug and caviar went down a treat and every aspect of the flight was excellent.

Emirates,8.0,A Thenayan,26th January 2015,RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier). I didn't go to the lounge in the DXB layover since it was from 12.00 am to about 7:00 am and I took a room in the airport hotel. The DXB-RUH flight was normal but the IFE was more outdated. I would say it was pretty good but there were a few flaws with the A380.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

Southwest Airlines,4.0,B Weber,14th August 2014,I heard last week that Southwest is the largest airline in the US now. Unfortunately I think their growth has resulted in decreased novelty and satisfaction. I do fly it on a regular basis because they service MDW from LAX but I find that the amount of space for seats is poor the wifi is the worst that I have found in the market in recent years (I work a lot on planes and SW wifi is very very slow). It is not worth looking at inflight snacks as the quality is so poor. It is now just an airline with less than average amenities.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,,,3.0,no
United Airlines,5.0,C Kim,13th October 2014,Just completed a series of three flights back to back. The flight attendants and all other aspects of the flight were passable but with that said that's as far as it seems to go. United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad. The flight attendants on most of my flights were much younger than the usual veteran crew that I encounter on their flights therefore enthusiastic. At the end of the day United may not be my first choice but it gets me there.,,,Premium Economy,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,yes

Flight attendants were very nice and present throughout the flight. They did 2 drink and snack runs and came through with water two times. In-seat videos provided plenty of entertainment choices for the 4 hour flight. Gogo wifi was great - worked throughout the flight. Turbulence was very bad 30 minutes out of LAX due to El-Nino winds. Pilot kept us informed and did a good job. Landed smoothly and was a good flight. AA gets really bad reviews here - I fly them 150,000 miles a year and yes - I've had some bad flights.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Pete Matthews,17th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Melbourne to Munich via Doha with Qatar Airways. Really good price on tickets. Flights between Melbourne and Doha were aboard a B777-300ER. A comfortable plane for long haul flights. Good leg room (and I'm a big guy). Entertainment system was good - plenty of new and old movies to choose from as well as other entertainment. As good as any I've seen (including Emirates). The food was mixed. Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there. Generally found that the Boeing planes were more comfortable than Airbus. Cushioning and leg room were much better on the former.

Southwest Airlines,9.0,S Andrews,22nd August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Traveled by myself from Grand Rapids to Philadelphia with a stop in Chicago Midway. Looked at prices for other airlines and I saw nothing less than $350 round trip. A co-worker suggested I check Southwest Airlines website since they don't pop up on Priceline and other travel websites and found the same flight for $240. Good first impression there. When I arrived I learned that my first flight from GRR to MDW was delayed 45 minutes as the plane was stuck in IAD - however, the attendants seemed very eager to get us to our destination and boarded those with close connecting flights first so they wouldn't miss them. I was impressed even further by the friendliness of the ground service. Great sense of humor. This was a reoccurring theme on each flight. Planes were clean and well maintained. I understand some of the planes received new seats which supposedly are far superior to the old ones. Wasn't super comfortable but better than any I've sat in on an American Airlines flight. I purchased wifi for 8 bucks and it lasted for the entire day, so I used it on both flights even though I had to change planes. Cabin service was efficient with a large selection of drinks. Attendants were very personable and helpful. I like how they read gate info before landing. Also worth noting that I travelled alone. I can see how their open seating process could negatively effect groups of people traveling together. They do offer family boarding after the A group boards which was neat to see. I landed a first row seat 3 of my 4 flights and it was very spacious but all carry on must be stored above. If you're traveling light it's worth climbing over a few people as the leg room was fantastic. Overall great first impression of Southwest. No large complaints worth noting. Can't beat their prices. It's hard to find good rates to bigger cities when flying out of an airport as small as Grand Rapids.

Air Canada,6.0,D Epstein,24th February 2015,ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,no

Also, another thing that I had complained in the past in the company's support contact form, is about other's passenger's cabin luggage, which in many are too big in comparison with the proper aircraft cabin luggage.

Delta dropped the ball so many times over the last 48 hours that Iâ€™m seriously considering never using them again. Iâ€™m thankful they realized a problem with the plane before we took off, but they were seriously incompetent from that point on. We unboarded the plane around midnight, weâ€™re told that we were on our own to find a hotel (at midnight), but they ended up helping some people secure a hotel, taxi, etc from a different kiosk. We ended up sleeping on a freezing cold concrete floor by the baggage claim, on one of the coldest night Maui has had in 10 years. It was pouring rain and windy as hell. They were actually getting snow on the peaks of Haleakala. We were told to go grab our luggage, but TSA was closed once we got down there, so we werenâ€™t able to go back upstairs in the warm enclosure. Those who stayed up there were given blankets, pillows, and water, but the 6 of us downstairs were left to fend for ourselves. And thatâ€™s just weâ€™re the drama began. One thing after another, over and over again, we dealt with issues from the Delta employees. People who didnâ€™t know what they were doing whatsoever. More delays, sending info for the wrong runway, and BS from employees in Utah once we finally landed, 3 hours late, at 2:30 AM. 48 hours of no sleep, rude and ignorant employees, and no info relayed to those of us on the flight.

At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket.

Food about average for an international airline. Planes were A330's seats much like Qatar Airways I rarely lay flat but it looked like others were able to. Amsterdam is a very good transit airport and the KLM lounge is very good thought it does not have a great variety of foods (what it has is good). Best part of the lounge for me was the ""deep rest"" room with chaise lounges in carrells in a very dark room with just enough light to get around.

More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively. I have found that the best way to avoid said delays is taking one of the first few flights of the day avoiding delays that seem not to stem from weather/mechanical issues but rather confusion that just seems to pick up steam throughout the day.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,4.0,Paul Beardshaw,10th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam. When an airline has so many lost luggage claims that after 45 days, your claim still hasn't been started, you have to ask yourself ""Is KLM the right airline to fly with?"". I have no complaint about the the planes, the staff or the on board experience, they're all pretty good. Where this airline fails is when they delay your flights because of missing catering, lose your luggage, smash that luggage and I lost some valuables. All of this happened to me in one flight. Trying to get their customer care team to acknowledge my claim and begin the investigation is proving to be more difficult than landing a vehicle on Mars. The day after I arrived back, my luggage arrived at my house and it was broken beyond repair, and missing several items. As I write this, it's been 45 days since I made first contact about this, and my claim is still sitting in a pile of claims, waiting to be started. Each time I call, my claim is being ""escalated to a manager"", only to find out the next time I call that this didn't happen. I've had every excuse available and not their staff hang up when I call. I have to use my colleague's mobiles so the support team does not recognise my number. If you are planning to book with KLM, only do so if you are only taking hand luggage with you, and you're prepared never to make a claim against the airline for anything else because, it's highly unlikely they will process your claim. The biggest frustration is, I enjoyed flying with them, it's just their Customer Care team that letting the airline down.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam,June 2018,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,no

We were calling and calling the hotel, but it never responded. After we took a taxi and reached, finally, the hotel, it turned out there were no vacant rooms for us there. The hotel's personnel sent us to another location (another taxi on our expense), and we were lucky to find vacant rooms there - it was about 3 am. Overall, it took us about five hours to have finally a rest after we landed. The next day, I found out that the route of my flight was changed - now, I had to take a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and an Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Lufthansa assigned me a seat to fly to Frankfurt, but they could not issue a boarding pass from FRA to SVO saying that they are not partners with Aeroflot.

Air New Zealand,1.0,H Salzberg,19th January 2015,"SYD-AKL. I was booked in business class on a late afternoon flight. I was informed by the airline that there had been a change and the flight no longer offered business class. Instead I was offered something called World Deluxe Service which is ridiculous and expensive for what it is. Basically it is a fully economy A320 aircraft where the first two rows only use two of the three seats. Essentially someone sits in 1A and 1C but they don't sell 1B. You also get lounge access and the onboard economy meal. I actually had to argue with the booking agent that I was entitled to money back. I had to explain that I had purchased a business class ticket (for myself wife and son) and now that they no longer provided me with business class they actually owed me money. Eventually they relented. The aircraft was absolutely disgusting. It was ancient (or looked ancient). My family was in 1A 1C and 1D (no one was in 1F or in row two at all). There was no divider wall in front of row one so I had to privilege of basically sitting in the galley for three hours watching the flight attendants work. My son was seated in 1C but I had to move him because ""he was too young for an exit row"". Since when is row one an exit row? We were sitting opposite two flight attendants. Wouldn't they operate the door in an emergency? Where they expecting my 9 year old to do it? Air New Zealand's seat selection system is the worst. It is time for the IT department to let you pick specific seats for each passenger instead of picking a block of seats for you. The seats on this aircraft had perhaps a millimetre of recline. It was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have never been on. The entertainment system worked poorly and my son's did not work at all. The only positive is that the Air New Zealand staff are perhaps the nicest people anywhere.

Air Canada,1.0,Janet Johnson,22nd December 2014,Service has deteriorated every year in the last 5 years. The staff at the airport representing Air Canada treat customers with disdain and do nothing to communicate delays etc. We are always left to guess about delays since no announcements are made. There is absolutely no courtesy shown towards regular customers. We are treated in a way that shows that our business is not valued at all. I only fly Air Canada because I have no choice where I live. I am happy WestJet will finally be providing service out of my local airport. At least then I will be able to experience some courtesy and satisfaction when I have to fly anywhere.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,8.0,Murat Polat,16th July 2015,"Flew to CDG to SAW with B737-800 TC-JFF (has the old livery). Flight was at 19.15, but at 15.00 I learnt that (via Turkish Airlines smartphone application) the flight was delayed by an hour. I couldn't arrive at the airport until 50 minutes before the flight. Even though the check-in counter closes an hour before the scheduled departure, I was able to hand in my luggage (I'd checked-in online). Pushback was at 21.10, and no explanations were made about the delay. At the beginning of the flight, Turkish delight was served. At dinner, either meatballs or chicken could be selected. I chose the meatballs, and it was delicious, and extremely hot for an airline food. I was able to listen the newest Euro Hits by using the in-flight radio. (Even though the playlist consisted of only 20-25 songs). The plane landed to SAW at 01.20, with a delay of 1 hours and 40 minutes.

In other words, a perfectly adequate experience, but not stellar by any standard. The 8-across configuration is so yesterday.

Both flights totally full but boarded on time with early arrivals on both sides despite bad weather all over USA.

Emirates,7.0,E Shek,14th January 2014,MEL-KUL-DXB-DEL COK-DXB-KUL SIN-MEL (the latter-most operated by QF). Return ticket (AUD1250) was excellent value for money. One of the more noticeable (but unfortunate) features was the rather surly and cold service across all EK flights. Most attendants were not too friendly concentrating on mechanically serving their flights which were fully booked. However food and beverage was solid and entertainment was excellent. Some points about particular flights: The EK409 MEL-KUL-DXB flight was unusually full of large families with young children so be prepared for a screaming economy cabin if booking this flight I would hazard a guess. This is not ideal especially given that the flight leaves MEL a few hours after midnight when you'd want a sleep. EK give me an opportunity to upgrade my COK-DXB flight to business through email for AUD330 which I took up. It was an amazing experience (for someone who has never flown business before). Service (unlike the economy service) was very warm friendly without being overbearing and the food and drink was excellent and constant (I ordered extra bread and dessert brought out very willingly). One of the attendants even got out a staff camera to take a picture for me which was a nice touch to the flight as I had told them it was my first time on business class. EK346 DXB-KUL on the A380 didn't seem any different from other aircraft although the inflight wifi was a added bonus. Overall I'd recommend EK for the excellent price but don't expect tip-top Singapore Airlines-type service.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

However the boarding attendant in Denver told everyone over speaker that they had been dealing with the issue for 3 days. My question is if you have had a broken down plane for 3 days don't you think you would consider finding an alternative solution to this problem prior to your booked flight checking in? So we get on the plane, fine we had a bit of delay still not angry except for the attendants with nasty attitudes! The only person that was halfway decent on this flight was the lady handing out the snacks! I was rudely asked to put my clutch under my seat that was safely strapped around my body with my personal contents inside (it's smaller than an ipad) that I wasn't asked to ""stow away"" on my previous flight. And an elderly man was refused the bathroom after we had been sitting at the St Louis airport for 10 minutes and had another 20 to wait because even though our flight was delayed 2 hours they still weren't ready for us to land which is crazy to me to think, you would think you would get more on top of it United.

United Airlines,1.0,J Armstrong,21st November 2015,"I called United to book a one way flight from LA to Dallas, but the person I spoke with could not speak English very well. After repeating, again and again the date of travel, this person finally managed to check the schedules and found a morning flight. I listened carefully, without interruption, to the flight times and flight numbers. United's agent said, ""OK, sir, I have you booked on flight XXX from LA to NY to Dallas. Can I have your credit card information please? I thought it strange that a United flight would travel across the USA to NY, turn aound and then fly to Dallas. I asked the agent if there was a more direct flight available and he replied, ""No."" I then said to the agent, ""Why is it necessary to fly first to NY and then to Dallas."" The agent replied, ""Sir, this is our schedule. A short lay over in NY and then to Dallas International."" Dallas International? I lived in Dallas for many years, and always knew the airport as DFW/Dallas Ft. Worth. Are you talking about Dulles International (not Dallas) in Washington, DC? The United agent replied, ""Yes sir, of course."" I said, ""No thanks,"" and hung up the phone. I was seconds away from giving this United agent my credit card information for an incorrect flight because of his inability to understand English. Last week I again telephoned United and was again connected to an agent with less than perfect English speaking ability. I hung up the phone. When I spend hundreds of dollars, if not thousands, on a particular product I become more cautious. And when I have trouble communicating with a vendor about such products because of a language issue, then I become wary and concerned that my questions and/or instructions will be either misunderstood or ignored. Find another vendor. United needs to understand that it's employees become their public image. And employees that cannot communicate properly will give the public a bad impression of United. United apparently does not understand that poor communication means poor customer service. And poor customer service always means a loss of business. Another issue is trust.

Aeromexico,1.0,Joshua Kors,11th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Mexico City to New York JFK. I was shocked by the horrible, unprofessional, incompetent way that I was treated by Aeromexico during my recent flight. Their deception, misinformation and incompetence cost me 8,612 extra pesos! I should not have been treated this way. I arrived at the Mexico City airport in the early morning, hours before my flight. I checked in at Aeromexico's check-in desk. The clerk checked my printed ticket and my U.S. passport and confirmed them. I asked if there was anything else, and she said no, that I was good to go. She checked in my suitcase and gave me the receipt for my checked-in bag. Then I went to my gate and waited several hours until boarding. When boarding began, I stood in line and eventually reached the front of the line, expecting to be checked in and board the plane. The Aeromexico employee at the gate asked me for the stub from my Mexican immigration papers, which I signed upon entering the country. The Aeromexico clerk at the baggage check-in had said nothing about this stub when I asked if there was ""anything else"" I needed. When she indicated that there wasn't, I placed the stub into my suitcase, which she then checked in. The clerk at the gate told me not to worry, that all I'd need to do is go to the Immigration desk and sign another immigration stub. She told me to sign it, then come back to the gate â€” that I could then board at the gate with no problem. That turned out to be a lie â€” or at least, radical misinformation. At her direction, I ran to the Immigration desk, signed a second immigration stub, and paid a 500 peso penalty, then sprinted back to the gate, returning just minutes after I had left. Suddenly the clerk at the gate had completely changed her tune. ""Sorry,"" she said, ""plane's leaving. You can't board."" I reminded her that she told me to go get the second immigration stub, return to the gate, and that I'd have no problem boarding the plane. The clerk brushed off my concern like it was of no importance and returned to chatting with a fellow employee. Upset, I went to the Aeromexico customer service desk. The clerk there told me not to worry, that this was no problem at all. ""There's a 9:05 am.flight to JFK,"" she said. ""Just go to the Aeromexico desk at L2 or L3, ask for the manager and have her switch you to that flight. It will be no charge."" But this turned out to be a lie too. I should have known something was up because the clerk refused to tell me her name. When I sighed, she told me again: Just go to L2 or L3, talk to the manager, and get the free reassignment. ""It's just a little bit of paperwork,"" she said. So I went to L2 and waited in line for 45 minutes to see the manager. When I got to the front desk, the clerk there said that if I wanted to get on the next flight, there would be a penalty - a 8,112 pesos. That's $453.65. ""It's Aeromexico procedure,"" they said.

American Airlines,1.0,Mimi Groom,8th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We fly first class mostly between Delta and American Airlines. We are seated right now in American Airlines from SFO to CLT. Our original flight was San Francisco to Dallas with final destination being Ft Myers. Seats generally more comfortable than Delta but no TV, no 110 outlets in our AA flight which means we canâ€™t even watch a movie on our computer for nearly five hour flight. Really? The most annoying thing about American Airlines is they constantly change the time and sometimes the route of the trips. Recently booked RSW to Paris for upcoming September trip and they have already changed the time making it very inconvenient. Our last trip from Vail to RSW had changed with 3 hours of layover in Dallas from 1 hour. I tried to change the time and they said because I had used our miles for that trip, they actually wanted to charge a fee for us to go to economy class (first class was full but we didnâ€™t want all the layover).

Lufthansa,4.0,P Goener,18th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd. Overboeken op een andere vlucht was niet mogelijk, alles zat vol. Andere vluchten naar Frankfurt vertrokken wel die avond. Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt. Men had dus makkelijk met een vertraging van een uur of zo kunnen vertrekken. Nu moet ik dus naast het gemis van werkuren onkosten maken om te krijgen waar ik recht op heb.

The second leg it was full and it was a hassle before take off with all the carry on bags the crew were asking passengers to collaborate by placing their smaller item under the front seat. This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines.

While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex.

Although we passed one man who was stretched out across several seats to himself, the two other seats in our new row were occupied by the largest lady on the aircraft plus her hand luggage. It happened to be my birthday on the day that we flew and I must say it spoiled my birthday somewhat. When we flew two days later from Dubai to Johannesburg, boarding staff asked how my birthday had gone, I replied that since she had brought it up it had been spoiled by the events during the previous flight. I was then told to request a particular row on this flight where we could have better seats as some way of recompense. When we boarded the plane once again, we were let down and the seats were not available. I tweeted and complained formally to Emirates about this. It actually took them 32 days to reply and that was after prompting and more tweeting. Many tweets and private messages on Twitter were actually ignored. When we eventually received a response it was disappointing and did not even refer to the fact that one passenger had four seats to himself. I have never come across such poor customer service to be frank. We certainly would never fly with Emirates again.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to JNB via DXB,September 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no

Emirates,3.0,Huajun Sharon Soon,28th November 2015,Singapore to Chicago via Dubai with Emirates. The crew were impatient and demanded to take away all the blankets 45mins prior to landing. Passengers were rudely awaken from their sleep during this freezing red eye flight and had blankets taken away. The crew then proceeded to collect all headsets in a very rude manner. I assume all these is to help turn around the aircraft quicker but this results in a very horrible flying experience. Not to mention the food is also cold and of poor quality. I have had experience with many other airlines around the world and this is certainly the worst service and worst food ever. I will never take Emirates again. For similar value I would choose Qatar airways.,,Business,Economy Class,SIN to IAD via DXB,November 2015,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

A few hours before pick up time we received a call confirming our request and indeed we were picked up by a van. Smooth check in, we could hand-over our golfbags to the groundstaff who delivered them to the special luggage desk. Emirates uses the Aspire lounge in Amsterdam which is hard to find due all ongoing renovation work in this airport. Boarding went OK in group, F and C passengers boarding straight to the upper deck. Arrival in Dubai in the B-concourse and we had to disembark via the forward stairs, making all Y passengers wait. Transfer was smooth, we used the Emirates longe in the C-concourse which was very crowded at that time of the day. In Mauritius the luggage was delivered using 2 belts, one for F/C and one for Y. Our luggage was delivered quickly, the golfbags were hand delivered from a different belt, again a very good service. Being seated in the middle (E/F paired) seats, both of us were served by different flight attendants. We asked them in the beginning of both flights whether they could synchronize their service as much as possible, and this worked perfectly. Cabin crew were very nice and attentive.

Air Canada,10.0,D Cheng,7th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I have never understood the bad rap that Air Canada gets. I have flown both main Canadian airlines (AC and WJ) lots and without really caring one way or the other, and have felt that Air Canada consistently offers high quality flights and flight service. On this recent flight I was in Premium Economy on a Boeing 787-8. Leg room and seat width in this cabin is substantially better than in coach, and you get the business class meal (china, glassware, and chilled silverware) with a printed menu and choice of main course. The meal itself is noticeably larger than in coach (if you are in coach, remember that you can ask for an extra meal and they are almost always able to give you one - I've done this on multiple occasions). Being an inter-continental flight, you also get complimentary alcoholic beverages in ALL classes. This flight (as well as AC850 from YYC to London) arrived early. The attendants were attentive and friendly, and airplane was clean, and the service was excellent. The Boeing 787 also compare favourably to other planes",,,,,,,,,,,,
American Airlines,1.0,Andrew Westcott,13th June 2014,We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets defective lavatories inflight entertainment was broken reading lights did not work fresh air vents that would not open or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Malcolm Gibson,3rd January 2016,"Partial review on behalf of my daughter and friend. They bought an American Airlines ticket from London Heathrow to St Thomas via Miami. They should have had two hours from touchdown in Miami to catch the connection to St Thomas. The flight from Heathrow arrived 50 minutes late. None of the American Airlines staff made any attempt to assist these two girls in making the connection. They sold them the ticket, so they must have known that they had a connecting flight, yet every enquiry they made they were told to wait. They missed the connection and eventually someone at AA did at least organise them a hotel. As I type 08.20 (US eastern) on the 3rd, they are in the departure lounge in Miami hoping for a cancellation on the midday flight to St Thomas. If they miss this, then they will not make their dream holiday, flotilla sailing holiday around the British Virgin Islands. The handling of this matter by American Airlines staff has so far been dreadful. Let's hope they pull out the stops to put right the problems caused by the late arrival of their aircraft and subsequent poor handling of customers needing to make connecting flights by their airport based staff",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to STT via MIA,January 2016,,,,,1.0,1.0,no

They called awakening me at 3am advising my flight was delayed until 12pm from its original time of 7.15 am. I arrived at the airport to self check in for my boarding pass because I couldn't print online due to the change. There was one person servicing people for ""self- check in"" in one line. So if people needed to check bags they were in the same line as those who did not need to check bags and only needed to get to the kiosk to obtain the boarding pass. An American employee should have been there to redirect people who needed only boarding passes and have separate lines. I stood in line for 30 minutes to get to the kiosk and obtain my boarding pass with no bags to check. Service attendant appeared incompetent to other customers ahead of me. The service was very slow with no pleasant smiling faces. Further I learned when I got to the gate that Flight 1202 again delayed another hour for 1 pm. Then I receive a voicemail that the flight again delayed until 5 pm and that I would arrive in Dallas 10.10 pm not to arrive in CT until Thursday at 12 noon. That was also not guaranteed. I needed to be in Hartford CT by 8 am. Hence why I scheduled the flight for early morning departure the day before. While I received a refund I didn't make my conference. They offered no alternatives to get me to CT in time on Wednesday. They only offered me an overnight stay at DFW airport red eye at 1.25 am with no sleep for arrival at my conference at 12 noon more than 4 hours late for the conference.

Air Canada,4.0,Kylie McNamara,28th April 2015,After reading lots of negative reviews I was a bit nervous about flying with Air Canada! We have just returned from a 5 week holiday flying with Air Canada all the way through from Sydney-Vancouver-San Francisco-New York- Toronto-Tel Aviv and back again. We got quite a reasonable airfare and when I consider each of the flights we took over the duration of our stay I have to say that overall I have no real complaints. We had no delays to any of our flights no flight schedule changes no issues whatsoever. All of the staff including ground staff and flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and we had no negative interactions. Staff were lenient on a couple of occasions without baggage allowance and we never waited long at the check in counters. Long haul flights no matter which airline are generally arduous and uncomfortable but Air Canada was certainly not the worst airline we have ever flown. The food was a little hit and miss but then it is extraordinarily difficult to cater meals for everyone also we tended to always eat a proper sit down meal at the airport before boarding a long flight so we often just skipped the first meal anyhow. If Air Canada offers a similarly well priced fare for our next holiday we would definitely consider using them again.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

On the day of return we arrive at the airport and after waiting in line for 30 minutes we were told that we don't have a booking. We had to then go to another line to purchase our ticket and had to pay the difference of 270 euros again. We were told at that counter that we don't have to pay for our luggage as we are Delta frequent flyers but the lady at the luggage drop off refused to listen and made us pay 30 euros but after paying it our bag was returned due to an error so we went to another full service counter with our baggage where we were told we shouldn't have to pay for luggage.

My original flight was supposed to take me to Chicago, then to Toledo. Those flights got delayed, and there were no other flights to Toledo for the night. They suggested that I take the flight to Chicago and be stranded there for the night, making it very clear they would not pay for a hotel nor meals. I had them switch my flights around so I would go to Phoenix and then Detroit, which would get me an hour further from home but at least I wouldn't need to find somewhere to stay. Again, flights kept getting delayed. I was concerned I would miss my connecting flight from Phoenix to Detroit so I asked the lady working at the gate counter about it and she spoke to me for condescending. She wasn't good at hiding her facial expressions. She talked to me like I was a child and was wasting her time. There was nobody behind me waiting to be helped, so it is not like she was even busy. She clearly does not need to be working in customer service. After I got to Phoenix, they boarded us on time to leave for Detroit, then had us sitting on the plane delayed for almost two hours with very few updates. Finally we figured out that something needed fixed on one of the planes wings, and it took this long to get someone there to fix it. Why board us all on a plane that may not even be operational in the first place, not sure. On top of all that, they gave us an old plane that we were unable to charge any of our devices on, AND I had a seat that did not move at all. So I got to be uncomfortable the entire flight with no form of entertainment. At one point I got up to get my sweatpants out of my bag because it was very cold, and the flight attendant just glared at me as if I was doing something wrong. I will never be booking with AA again.

I missed my connecting flight to Greensboro from Charlotte on 2/19/2019 due to rainy, cold weather. I entered Charlotte airport at concourse A and had to depart from concourse E which is about a 12-15 minute walk. Once I was informed that plane's door was closed and could not be opened, I asked what my options were, I was told everything from ""rent a car, it's only an hour away"" to ""go stand in line"". An agent pointed at the Customer Service area which had approximately 100 people surrounding it. I was told I could either go stand in line or give the airline a call. It would have been helpful if the agents could have provided information regarding when the next flight out was scheduled, a list of hotels available in the area, or who to contact for questions. None of this was offered to me. Instead, I had to listen to a ground crew staff complain that the flight attendant let passengers disembark the plane before the ground crew were ready and watch an agent put chapstick on while he was trying to deal with upset passengers. There was a glaring lack of professionalism from almost every employee I encountered with American Airlines. It was clear that passengers missing their flight were not American Airline's problem, and agents were quick to let me know that they were under no obligations if the delay was weather-related. After the chaos had subsided, I was able to speak calmly with an agent and get a boarding pass out for the next morning. I was also able to book a room with no assistance from American Airlines. I was lucky to find a room at all and got one of the last rooms at a Best Western 15 minutes away.

American Airlines,8.0,Kelsey Hines,5th November 2014,First time I flew American (I usually fly Delta) and I must say that overall I was impressed with the airline. On the way to NYC we departed on time and even got there 30 min early (never has happened to me before). The staff were helpful and the efficiency of the service was a huge plus to me. On the way back to Detroit we did board a bit late and sit on the runway for a while but again was a quick flight and really not much that I can complain about.

Air Canada,1.0,Williams Temidayo,18th February 2015,Air Canada is by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with. I was forced to sit through a 8 hour flight from London to Toronto with no TV entertainment because their screen was faulty while other passengers around me had their TVs working. The staff on board thought offering me newspapers was a good alternative to not having TV entertainment which we all pay for as part of ticket costs! Its like asking me to eat carrots for 8 hours rather than giving me the solid meal I was told I would receive as part of the service. Unbelievable.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

They had cots present to sleep on but failed to mention they wake you up at 4am. Sat at my gate for 4 hours just to find out they had changed it without me knowing about it so I had to run to my next gate. I got there with 10 minutes to spare but they closed the gate, would not let me on, and said that my ticket had not been issued when I had it present on my phone. Next flight was not until 3 pm, luckily was on standby at 12 pm where I managed to get on an ""overfull"" plane last minute. Arrived home 14 hours later than I paid for.

We were told that we would get a hotel at Charlotte, where our connecting flight would leave and were we would have to wait for several hours (original change time was 2 hours, now 6.5 hours). When we arrived, we were met by very rude loud American Airlines staff that were willing to do nothing about the matter or help us in anyway. Hotels were booked, but nonetheless they did not offer food or anything in compensation. Or even an apology (like it was our fault).

Southwest Airlines,8.0,S Quei,16th September 2012,"Flew round-trip SJC-LAS-SJC outbound on Sep 11 (flight 328) returning on Sep 14 (flight 259). The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne.

Air Canada,5.0,Cohen Jonathan,14th September 2014,"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,no

Lufthansa,7.0,Margot Love,19th July 2015,My original flight for my return to NZ was to Shanghai however due to Thunderstorms at Frankfurt the Paris flight was delayed and arrived an hour and a half late causing missed connection to Shanghai. Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai. This was fabulous. Overall my experience of Lufthansa is very good. I would fly with them again.,A340,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Dubai via Frankfurt,July 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Aeromexico,1.0,Mel Lavina,31st July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I travelled on July in Aeromexico from Mexico to Narita Tokyo - I had never had such a problems I found travelling in Aeromexico. For me it was the worst experience I had from an international airline. On July 4th from Tokyo to Mexico DF, the service was kind of self-service. I felt like the Aeromexico crew was acting as ""divas"" and we passengers, we were just the audience. They provided us some dinner then we had to wait almost one hour before the arrival to Tokyo to get another meal. Some people stand up to ask what happened with the meal, as almost all people were hungry. They said there was no problem, ""everything was under control"". Some snacks were provided at the back of the plane, however there was no information about this until you discovered them. On July 28th, the way back from Mexico to Tokyo was the longest flight in my life, as 2 or 3 hours after taking-off, they announced there was an electrical problem, not serious at all however we would need more fuel, so we were on the way to Guadalajara to refuel. This took two additional hours of a 12 hours flight! Also, the maintenance of one of the restroom was not good, as one of the toilet's lid couldn't stand on the tank, so for women we had to use it with the toilet lid standing on our back. I could not imagine how men did, to use this toilet. When I reported the problem to one person of the staff, the Aeromexico staff affirmed that restroom was working well, as she thought I was talking about a problem of flushing it. Then I showed her the toilet lid problem, she said: ""Oh, yeah"". Maybe for her it was not a problem! Additionally, one of the staff spilled some coke almost on me, the internal communication between staff on the plane, I heard one treating each other as ""cabron"", which shows again the non-professional staff working in Aeromexico. When they knew I could understand Spanish, they decided to move somewhere else to talk, and instead of being attentive to their passengers, they keep chitchatting during the flight. Aeromexico staff have no notion of in-flight service and service is at not all on the standards of a Skyteam airline.

The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights. To compete with the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers though Delta needs to brush up on a few areas.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Jamie Phillips,14th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Houston to Norfolk via Baltimore. I flew out of Houston, TX to Norfolk, VA on 5Oct and was to return on 12Oct. My Daughter's 2nd Birthday was on the 7th of Oct. I went to the gate on the 5th for my departure, nothing was said about having to pay for my daughter's return flight because she was ""2"" now. I go to the airport to depart and was rudely told I need to pay for her ticket, and that the information is on the website - and that she is ""Sorry I didn't read it"". I would assume being in customer service and knowing the regulations that it would have still been told to me when looking at my daughter's Birth Certificate and seeing she turns two within the time of my stay in VA. I called the airline and they told me that I have no choice but to pay $243.80 for my daughter to fly back. I didn't anticipate the money and didn't have it. I had to miss my flight, and go back to a friends house that I stayed with. I didn't have a rental car anymore because I had to turn it in, so I had to wait for someone to come & get my daughter and I. After I got to my friends house I called and spoke withthe Customer Relations Dept and she said she was sorry about my situation and that I could apply for a donation ticket back. I went to the website and read that SWA gives away 40,000 free tickets a year to ""those in need"" but the request can take 6-8 weeks. I have a job I had to get back to, didnt have enough diapers, or anything to continue my stay. So, I called them back. Again, ""I am sorry, but there is no way around it- you'll have to pay"". I told the agent I can pay on the 19th, but will it still be the same amount of money for my daughter to fly back, and how much will it cost to change my reservations. She said they can't guarantee the price will be the same, and that she didn't know how much more out of pocket I would have to come out. I live paycheck to paycheck. I only went to VA because my oldest daughter gave birth to my first Grandchild, and it was important I would be there. I could have left my daughter with my Husband while I was gone if I would have known I had to pay for her return flight back. But since I was stuck there, no one cared and upper management that could have helped me, and also didnt want to get on the phone themselves did not help, nor care I was stranded without a vehicle and no place to go with my 2 year old daughter. I was fortunate enough to reach out to distant family and borrow the money to fly back home with my baby. I have never flown with SWA before, I always chose Delta - and from here on out I will stick with Delta.

Upon check-in, the lady at the counter informed me the flight was departing on time as scheduled. Thirty minutes later, the first first delay alerts started to come in. Initially, it was a three hour delay, that became 5hr 15min, eventually it settled at a delay of 4hr and 45 minutes. There was no explanation at all given as to the delay, just told to sit and wait. Time went by, and at around 11pm, the airline's lounge started to broadcast that they were closing. With this flight and several other flights of Air Canada delayed by several hours (one delayed by 6 hours), you would think the airline had the courtesy of keeping the lounge open longer in these exceptional circumstances to accommodate the premium passengers and frequent fliers. Finally, it was time to board, and the boarding area was already full of passengers impatient to board the long-delayed flight. Suddenly, the ground staff came on the intercom and announced that the flight would be ""delayed"" until late afternoon of the next day, a ""delay"" of 21hrs. People were obviously very upset and there was chaos. The ground staff tried their best to calm nerves and frustrations, but the worst was the lack of news, lack of updates and lack of announcements what passengers were entitled to during the flight waiting period. As for the cancellation, they announced that they are not in a position to book hotels for people (not even to offer discount vouchers), so hundreds of people had to go off on their own at 1am!

Almost everything went wrong, and Emirates do not care! As we take off from Clark to Dubai I got About 1 litre of water in my lap, so that I had to sit with wet pants most of the way, and on top of that, the entertainment system was defective. They did not have any food for my 16-month-old son, they would have had if he was on the bottle, but he is on solid food so my wife shared her food whit him, or what she got, for the only thing that they got was half a kids meal. So we had to buy some food when we got to Dubai. On the way back the boarding was a complete chaos we were but in a bus for 40 min. waiting or going around in circles, without any information, before we got to the plane, and there it looked like the one that had to be in front in the plane was dropped on in the back, and the other way around.",Boeing 777 / A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cebu to Copenhagen via Dubai,September 2018,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,5.0,W Peters,14th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Good journey from Manchester to Dubai. Had a 1hr 25min connection time for our flight to Bangkok. When we got to Dubai the plane seemed to take an age to park up, the pilot said that there was a slight delay as waiting for a slot. We stopped, and were bussed off: why does such a modern airport have to bus people off such a large modern aircraft? Eventually got on to our bus. Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal, people around us even joked that we're going straight into town, it just kept driving & driving. I've never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off, an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says 'you better run for it!' So we run for it, two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty, no time for water or coffee, & angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help, point the way etc, we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot, thirsty and angry. The staff on the plane were really nice and gave us some water.

Jetblue Airways,1.0,M Kaye,13th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Jacksonville. First and last experience with this airline. Thinking back...I should have clued in to what might lay ahead with this airline since we departed JAX for JFK on another airline and I had noticed then that several of the JetBlue flights had been canceled that were leaving around the same time as ours and our Delta flight departed as scheduled. We had booked JetBlue for our return flight and had arrived on an international flight so had 7 hr layover. Another clue that I should have picked up on, the enormous customer service line located at the JetBlue gate area and the number of people that were crying. After waiting 5 hrs for our scheduled flight we were advised 2 hrs prior to departure that our flight was canceled. Waited in line 1.5 hrs for the agent to tell us they had no available flights for our family of 5 to to get out of New York until 3 days later - no compensation for accommodations - there were cots in baggage claim to sleep on and, in addition, this airline does not work with other airlines to look for other travel availability - only what is available in the JetBlue system.

United Airlines,5.0,S Mossop,10th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Newark to London. My first impression when checking in the staff seemed friendly but pushed for time meaning the service was quickly over, although it was fast it came across rude when they would hurry me and my travelling friends along. When boarding the aircraft we were welcomed by a lovely set of crew that were happy to point us in the direction of our seats, I was confused as to why there were not any other crew members in the centre of the aircraft welcoming us, like on other airlines I have flown with, all the flight attendants seemed to be in the back galley chatting amongst each other. After takeoff the flight attendants started the service offering drinks, smiling didn't seem like an option for many of the crew I was confused as I noticed across the middle seating that the other crew members were bright and cheerful. The inflight meal was rather poor, I had two options one that I was told was pasta and the other chicken, that's about as much information that I was given so I chose the chicken - it was hardly chicken when there was about four smaller pieces of chicken inside and some bread and a side dish the cheese sauce was vile as it was getting cold by the time the cart had reached me. During the flight two medical emergencies came up with the group I was traveling with, the flight attendants were quick to react and made sure that both passengers where okay. They asked for any medical professionals to step forward and the matter was resolved within around an hour after departure when a travelling nurse was able to help. I think the inflight entertainment system was really great to occupy those who couldn't sleep.

American Airlines,8.0,S Matias,21st January 2015,LHR-LAX flight in business class: new 777 aircraft. Excellent flight very attentive crew (best ever on AA) good IFE and WiFi which was a great treat - $19 for a 10 hr flight is not unreasonable but you would perhaps expect to be free of charge for First and Business Class travelers? SFO-ORD-LHR: flights in Main Cabin Extra. The usual 737 for the internal flight which was fine. Again attentive staff. The leg from ORD to LHR was on a very old and dated 767 which you really no longer would expect to exist in a company from a 1st world country? IFE broke down so everyone had to make do with their own entertainment options. Cabin crew were excellent again. I fell asleep as we took off and missed my meal when I woke up I was offered it within 10-15 minutes. I have had a fair few flights with American in the past to the US and because my partner has Executive Platinum status with them we always do tend to get upgrades to business class but have never thought much of the service so far.

Air Canada,1.0,S Gurjal,3rd April 2015,My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no

Air New Zealand,2.0,A Boone,31st July 2014,"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

Although I left ample transfer time of 90 minutes to catch my connection flights in AMS, the inbound delays resulted in mad run through the terminal to catch my connection both times, as Schipol has very long distances between gates. On the way out I had just carry-on luggage and made my connection at the last minute. On the way back I managed to reach my connection, but my check luggage did not, which was not really surprising. It was delivered the next day. Used Web check-in which working fine and KLM allows to pre-select seats during the reservation process at no extra cost. Checked luggage is charged extra, but prices are reasonable (EUR 10 per flight). FAÂ´s friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable for the length of the flights. Drinks served including beer and wine, with additional drinks on request. A cheese sandwich with no alternatives served on the inbound flights to AMS and biscuits/crisps on outbound legs. Forget the food, but the drink service was okay. Not a bad inflight product for European standards. However, room for improvement operational wise (delays and lost luggage).

Thus I had cold seafood platter as starter hot salmon as 1st maincourse and as 2nd main course: kofta 3rd main course: pasta and 4th rice with giant prawns. Cheese platter of high quality. Good advice on wines. IST-YYZ-IST on Boeing 777-300. Perfect hardware (inclusive WiFi) and excellent food. However the staff (FAs) has a lot to improve on - Language Socializing Read and understand passengers minds and needs. They need to avoid speaking Turkish to ""all"" passengers and could recruit a bulk of international staff to beef up Spanish Chinese Vietnamese Thai French Arab and â€¦English. The timing of service inputs need improvement. Sense of FA-humour is nil FA's avoidance of passengers is felt -â€“ one could sit on the entire flight without being offered more than 10% of what are available.",,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
American Airlines,10.0,Ray Sorin,27th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to London. After reading many recent poor reviews of American Airlines, we were concerned that we too might have a flight of horrors. However, our experience was the opposite of most of the recent reviews. The Flagship Lounge at JFK, while very busy, provided a good opportunity for a pre-flight meal. The flight, AA 100, to LHR left a few minutes behind schedule, but landed on time. The flight attendants offered reasonably friendly in-flight service throughout. There was more food and drink on offer during the flight than anyone could have wanted (dinner, snacks, more snacks, breakfast). The lie flat seat, with Casper bedding, while a tad firm for some most likely, provided the opportunity to get a short nights sleep. Fortunately, we never experienced even one of the horrors that so many reviewers have written about. We will fly back to JFK on Monday, in the Premium Economy cabin, and if the experience is any different, based of course on what is reasonably expected in that cabin, we will add a review.",Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,New York to London,2018-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes

This was solved after long discussion at the airport check in. Then our Priority tags on our suitcases were removed somewhere between check in and loading to aircraft. So we had to wait nearly an entire A380 flight baggage to be delivered before getting our so called Priority bags. Our connecting flight from DOH to BKK was delayed about 6 hours, so we spent the night at DOH airport. They started out with a 3 hour delay, and later when the first 3 hours was nearly elapsed the delay was changed to 6 hours. Qatar Airways has a rule to give hotel accommodation if the delays is 6 hours or more, but of course we did not get this.

We utilized the complimentary shuttle service at the Trinoma pick up point. There were just a handful of passengers so the bus ride was fine. Check in at CRK airport was okay although there was a glitch in terms of the seat assignment. When I purchased the tickets, I made sure seat assignments were reserved and confirmed. Unfortunately, when we get to the check in counter, we were assigned different seats on our DOH-MAD leg. I find it exasperating as my partner and I were traveling together yet we were situated in seats far from each other. What's the point of pre-selecting seats? Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold. Whiled away the time at the waiting area. Boarding came, there was no system in place. Boarding queue was chaotic. Premium passengers were overtaken by coach passengers. Anyhow, in-flight service was superb. The cabin crew took heed of my specific requests. It was great as it was dining-on demand. Meal service was spotless.

Weather in the DC area delayed us 3 hours, the captain kept us informed and the crew distributed water and snacks. UA lived up to its promise - beer and wine were complimentary.

United Airlines,1.0,L Grand,13th April 2014,We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no

I got another voicemail from them the next day saying the exact same thing, so I called back and managed to get myself on another flight. Comes the day of the flight, I am at the airport 2 hours early, and my tickets haven't even been ticketed! I spent a whole hour and a half on the phone with a representative to fix the whole thing, and by that time, I received another call from AA to tell me that the 2nd segment of my flight has been cancelled - 7 hours before its departure! The rep on the phone finally managed to find a 3-segment flight to my destination. By that time, it's too late for me to make my first flight, and thank god for WestJet (operating the flight) front desk, they managed to push me through and off I went, running for my life to make the initial segment of my flight.

Jetblue Airways,3.0,M Shafer,21st June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to New York JFK. Pros: Lots of free snacks such as: pop chips, sweet potato chips, cheeze its, and choc chip cookies. In flight wifi that includes free messaging. In flight TV channels. Cons: Very limited number of airports they fly in and out of within the US. Their planes have an outdated interior, like really outdated. TV screens on the back of seats that are super pixelated and are no bigger than 5'x5' squares. This is your only means of watching the inflight TV channels and movies. The movies have to be started at the beginning of your flight, they start on their own channel and can't be paused. They charge $80+ for the exit row. I personally had a not great experience on my flight home when our six hour flight was delayed due to ""catering"" only to then be told that catering couldn't make it to our plane so they just left without the food for the flight. I also ended up in a seat with a broken headphone jack that only emitted a high pitched squeal so I couldn't watch the tv. The TV tray at my seat was also broken, causing anything on it to slide into the aisle. I reported all these things to JetBlue, only to be told that my trouble was worth a $15 refund.

We booked a Business Class flight to Merida from Vancouver and it was uneventful, it was not bad but was not good. Mediocre food and mediocre customer service. On our way back is when it became a nightmare we had a 2 hour delay due a mechanical problem in our plane, we had to connect in Mexico City and after running with bags and cases to the gate 15 minutes before the plane will took off. The lady at the gate did not want to let us in (we were still in time to board), they were many passengers in our delayed flight and was actually fault of Aeromexico, but she say nobody inform her about the delay. She simply didn't want to help or even call a superior to help, she was rude and completely careless. She send us to another stand to make changes in our flight and we got one flight but in Economy, even they had seats in Business Class. They didn't offer absolutely any compensation or apology for the now 8 hours delay in the flight. Then at home, we called and emailed many several times for many hours and months where we have dealt with so many different people and phone numbers, they just refuse to compensate the delay and the downgrade on our tickets as it was our fault. They offered a ridiculous upgrade with a code where you have to call a special number and that only apply to specific flights and so on, practically an offer you cannot claim. I feel scammed and robbed, we pay for a service and they didn't provide it and they simply refuse to reimburse what we pay, or the difference of it. I have flown many times and with many different airlines and I have never experience a completely lack of empathy of the customer service personnel.

No offers were made at all to make any passenger feel better about their service, just a rebooking. Today travel was going smoother, I had a two hour planned delay and I asked a Delta rep if they could put me on a near empty flight that had seating available and left an hour earlier. I didn't even have a checked bag. I was treated rudely by Delta staff and told it was a $50 up charge even though I had no baggage and I explained my previous poor experience. You would think they would want to help a little at no cost to them. The Delta staff didn't care and didn't even offer to attempt to ask anyone what could be done. I'm not a rude passenger, just hoping they would help me out to have a better experience this time. I own a small business and I think it's a shame when a company becomes so large that common sense and courtesy to customers cannot prevail. I would be appalled if my employee treated my customer this way. I will be interested to see if Delta cares enough to contact me, if not, there are other airlines I can use for my business travel for me, my employees and my family.

American Airlines,1.0,T Irving,15th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Frankly the worst airline and a disgrace to the American people for calling themselves American Airlines. They are a horrible representation of our country with their lack of service, lack of care or accountability. My flight from SJC to a connecting flight at LAX landed late. 10mins before the gate was scheduled to close, we were told that our gate had changed. We took off later because we had to wait for passengers to disembark first. At LAX, we taxied for 20mins before the captain decided to inform us of the delay from traffic and light rain. My layover was only 50mins so I only had 10mins to get to my gate by the time I disembarked. I informed ground staff about this to which they just pointed to a massive line at gate 52G which required a bus transfer to Terminal 4. There were many in line who had a connecting flight from LAX to HKG, like myself, but they did nothing to ensure we would make the flight. When myself and others arrived at the gate, AA staff simply shrugged and pointed us to customer service who gave many of the customers attitude. I was ""lucky"" enough to be booked onto the next flight 24hrs later w/ a hotel. The next day I confirmed with AA staff at the gate twice and customer service that my checked baggage would be on board. They all confirmed, however, it never made it onboard. I had to call incessantly to finally have them track my bag. I finally received my bag 4 days later with items stolen...Lastly, the boarding pass says ""gate closes 10mins before flight"".

Emirates,3.0,G Nagy,6th February 2015,In December I flew from Zurich to Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. Will never fly with them again unless I have no other option.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,no

Her lay over in Doha was overnight for about 12 hours or more and the last time they said the only hotel available inside the airport was full. This time we got the transit visa which was applied for on the website and was quickly processed and arrived before the 7 day published on the site. On arrival in Doha, Qatar Airways arranged for her transportation and escorted her to a nearby 4 star hotel, provided wifi, a dinner voucher, woke her up the next morning in time to get dressed, have breakfast and picked her up promptly for her onward journey. Hotel stay, food, and transportation for that night may have amounted to just about $125 which is a tiny fraction of her ticket cost but I am so impressed and grateful for the peace of mind l had that she was well taken care of.

Only one thing really suprised me was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW.

United Airlines,1.0,S Sullivan,6th April 2015,"I made my reservation months in advance. I was supposed to have an aisle seat about 5 seats from the back of the plane. When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice.

American Airlines,6.0,Neil Hopkins,7th September 2015,"Manchester to New York JFK with American Airlines, being the first leg of 2 travelling to Las Vegas with my wife and son. After reading some of the horror stories previously I wasn't looking forward to the flights. The day got off to a bad start with a 2hr queue for checking in at Manchester airport, and then to find out that the seats that my wife had booked online (window seats) were then not available to us and we were put in the centre section - although one of us would be sitting by ourselves, this was rectified on board with another passenger who kindly swapped. The flight was on time and we made it with 20 minutes to spare thanks to the mass chaos at check in, the plane looked new and clean from the outside, but once inside the aircraft all that changed, and you stepped back in time to the 1990's. The cabin was dreary and their was also a stale smell in the air (like a pub carpet), and also the entertainment system may have well been non existent with the overhead TV's (no seatback entertainment here). The flight was good, the cabin crew were good - friendly and no attitude, the food was good, and also the refreshment service was no problem (free drinks). The seats may have been old, but they were spacious and plenty of legroom in front. Would I fly with AA again - if I got the same level of service then yes, if it was a dirty aircraft that desperately needs dragging into the modern age for a long haul flight then no.

The seat is very comfortable considering the configuration. I would deduct a star as they really do cram the seats in by adding 2 additional seats in every town when most airlines add an inch to the seat width and have a 2x4x2 configuration Emirates elects to do 3x4x3 which feels a lot more cramped than other 777 aircraft I have been on.

Aeromexico,7.0,G Castillo,20th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Before taking this trip, I read so many horrible reviews of Aeromexico. We flew from Toronto to Guatemala City, with a layover in Mexico City. One thing I will say is that these flights never leave on time. I think every single one of our flights were late. But, we still managed to arrive at our destinations within 10-20 minutes of the original arrival time (sometimes earlier). Though, I think it would be ideal to keep in mind that if you have to make a layover, try and plan for at least a 1-2 hour layover. This will give you some wiggle room with an airline that is notorious for delays and save you the headache and stress. The food was mediocre, but I find most airplane food is. I have flown several times internationally to Asia, and have never liked the food. On our flights it was a croissant sandwich and a snack - standard and nothing wrong with it. I didn't have any negative experiences with the flight attendants on these flights. No one was rude or unhelpful. Seats were as comfortable as I expected them to be. A few of our flight segments were overbooked, which seems to be general practice for most airlines, which is what seemed to lead to the delays we were experiencing.

I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not LufthansaÂ´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,,Michael Taksar,10th April 2011,The service at SVO airport is horrible. I flew to Copenhagen by SAS flight 8700 operated by Aeroflot. The agent wanted to charge me for the excess baggage. I tried to explain to her that on a code sharing flights I am governed by the rules of SAS not by Aeroflot rules. But she did not want to listen repeating again and again that she knew the rules. Eventually after a long verbal exchange she called the authorities and found out that I was right. In the Aeroflot lounge - which I was entitled to use in lieu of SAS lounge - the employee on duty refused to let me in. She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge. The same girl who did not allow me in eventually had to call and find out that she was wrong. She never apologized. In fact all the personnel there turned out to be so rude and incompetent.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,6.0,M Studzinski,14th January 2015,Moscow-Warsaw 18 Dec. Pros: nice new clean Airbus aircraft with leather seats and decent legroom. Flight on time. Very smart looking attractive cabin crew. Good English so all announcements were understandable ( quite rare with Aeroflot). Cons: service downgraded rapidly since last month's flight I took with them. This time only small sandwich and water/coffee/tea offered - nothing else (last time was tray with meal cake and whole selection of soft drinks). EU restrictions I suppose. Cabin crew very official and robotic absolutely no personal touch no interaction - beautifully groomed but cold and serious. Inflight magazine thick and full of good articles but in Russian only (literally last 4 pages were in English only) which is pity as it looks very interesting.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

I flew LAX-NRT yesterday - disinterested and poorly-dressed cabin crew small and uninspired meals and an entertainment system that could have been considered to be state of the art in 1990. Each time the fasten seat belt was on there were no safety announcements and passengers and crew wandering around the aircraft during turbulence.

Traveling by herself it was alarming to hear she did not make her flights (both times). American Airlines went above and beyond to accommodate her to make sure she was safe and well taken care of. They arranged another flight for her and kept me posted each time. They took good care of her as well as myself (who as you can imagine was filled with worry).

The flight portion from PDX to DEN, the Captain / First Officer were, but the wifi did not work, and I was needing to get work done. On my return flight, MCI to DEN, the hostesses were very rude. DEN to PDX the wifi did not work again, but they were pushing to sell Direct TV. If the wifi did not work, then why would I take a chance of swiping my credit card to attempt to watch tv? The flight was delayed from MCI to DEN due to the plane setting overnight and frost had built up on the wings. Well, if you know it's 20 degrees outside and you have a 6am flight, would you not de-ice the plane before everyone boards to prevent delays? I almost missed my flight change from DEN to PDX because the flight was delayed due to frost. When I complained at PDX on my return part of the trip, I was told ""sorry, maybe it'll be better next time"" - seriously ""maybe"" was their best answer.

My first thoughts were how the cabin service reminded me of what economy class once was when I flew as a teenager in the late 1970's. This trip was from SEA to ORD to IND and back. Zone 1 boarding: Great! Initial cabin greeting was pleasant and prompt. Seat comfort good. Seat pitch a bit tight. Drink and snack service: very good. Flight Attendants: If I ran my own airline I would hire each attendant that I encountered on this trip. Meal service was good no complaints. Inflight entertainment: On the outbound trip there seemed to be a good selection that I could watch no charge on my own device. Connectivity needs to be simplified! On the return part of my trip the equipment was Inop. This is the second US carrier that I've encountered with Inop inflight equipment.

American Airlines,1.0,S Saunders,31st March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Kona to Indianapolis via Dallas. The fiasco started in Kona with an initial 2 hour delay. The trip was to begin at 6:30 PM but did not begin loading unitl 8:30. Then we sat on the plane until 9:30 when we started out of the tarmac and began to taxi and the pilot came over and said the check engine light has came on again, we will need to return to the gate. 30 min later he advised us that United Airlines were in our gate and we were stuck on the tarmac. At 11:00 PM the pilot said we will give everyone an opportunity to deboard the plane, but within 1-2 min after the announcement the pilot came back on the intercom and stated they needed to do a quick engine test and that all passengers were to remain seated, only those in first class had the opportunity to deboard. Those passengers including myself who were still in the process of deboarding were directed back to our seats. Then at 11:45 the staff announced we have another problem, we sat so long we needed refueled but the staff put the fuel in the wrong tank making us unequally balanced, so fuel had to be taken out and placed in the center fuel tank. At 12:30-1 we finally left Hawaii, once at Dallas we had more delays, after missing 3 connections we then headed to a gate with a Chicago destination but unfortunately they did not put my girlfriend on the flight. We were waiting again, they then rerouted us to a direct flight to Indianapolis, we had to run to get there and once again we had a 3 hour mechanical delay. The trip is now over 24 hours and we were not served a meal the entire time, there were no vouchers given for the time inconvenience, no food vouchers as only snacks were offered in the period of 6:30 PM Sunday to 6:30 PM Monday with no time in between to eat a hot meal due to all the missed connections and literally running to the next flight to be only delayed again. In all this after many emails to customer service they only provided ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience, we hope we can do better the next time if you choose to fly with us again and offered only 15K air miles which is the equivalent of maybe $150, when I spent 100K air miles for this trip. Their defensive responses to emails were very inaccurate, unprofessional, condescending and overall poor customer service response was a perfect representation of how I was treated on the flights with American. The lack of a caring, empathetic, customer first attitude is rampant in American Airlines. I would be ashamed to treat people like jailed criminals stuck in an airborne jail cell, limited to a seat with limited movement and then given only a snack and a drink in a 24 hour period.

I chose this airlines because I figured that anything would be better than Spirit but how wrong I was. The flight to Florida went off without a hitch however the flight home was a different story. The flight was delayed by more than 2:45 minutes and of course we were not extended the courtesy of being informed of this as we were checking in baggage. It was only realized as we approached the gate where we encountered hundreds of angry passengers. There was zero communication. We were told to stand in the line containing hundreds of people if we wanted to make other arrangements. Needless to say after standing there for over an hour only to watch the line shorten by 1 person I had had enough. I called the 800 number where I was informed they could book me on the next days flight but they couldn't tell me where, how, or what to do about my luggage. Had they told me upon the time I was checking in my luggage I could have made the decision as to what to do at that moment but to mislead me, take my money, and send me upstairs to what they knew was a nightmare was far more unprofessional.

Aegean Airlines,5.0,K Martin,23rd January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew from Athens to London Heathrow in Business Class. I have flown with Aegean many times before, mostly in Business Class and their service has been consistently good. On this occasion though there were problems. Aegean offer 4 free seat upgrades to their Gold flyers and 2 upgrades to their Silver flyers. This means a lot of passengers flying Business class for ""free"". On my flight there were 16 passengers in C class, 50% of which were free upgrades. One FA only was assigned to this cabin and as a result the service was far below expectations. The FA could not provide the service required on time or at the level it should be. For example, drinks were coming very slowly and the starter and main were served at the same time which is very unusual for Aegean on this route. By the time I finished my starter, the main was too cold. Also, passengers in C class were putting their feet up on the back of the front seat with the FA allowing it without any sort of comment. Certainly not a good experience this time. I have flown many times with Aegean, I recommend them and I consider them one of the best airlines in Europe. However, if they want to take the extra step and get another star they need to sort out some small things like these upgrades. Maybe reduce them? Do they need them for Silver members? During busy times, their C cabin needs more than one staff to keep up with the workload.

The customer service was great! The other thing I really appreciate is having porters at the airport to check in the bags.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes

United Airlines,2.0,Derek Northcutt,7th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | United's flight from Denver, 1.5 hours late. Missed airport pickup, had to pay for another ride $28. Pilot said we were waiting for mechanics to come to tighten some bolts (I do not know if he was speaking seriously). Food on board not as described on menu: hamburger had no lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles as promised. As small as it was and served bare it was just like a 99c white castle hamburger. Seats comfortable and cabin crew kind and gentle. Agent at PSP kept trying to get money from me: first he claimed I'd have to remove 3 lbs b/c suitcase was 73 lbs. He had another bag on the scale. After removing it he said I was 1lb over and I said that 23 kilos is 51 lbs. He didn't care. Then insisted I pay $25 to check a suitcase even though was making an international connexion to one of their partners, but the swarthy 20-year old doesn't know what qualifies as a connexion. I couldn't convince him or his supervisor and they refused to call a ticketing expert. I was firm and insistent but because this supervisor told me I was rude (limited vocabulary), I paid the fine.

Air Canada,4.0,Sara Smith,26th June 2015,"I've flown transatlantic on Air Canada twice this year, both less then ideal experiences. For my flight from Calgary to Munich there was a promotion to check ski bags for free for flights to Europe. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told I would have to pay $100 because by bag was over 50lbs and the promotion only applied to those under this weight. Once I got my boarding pass, I found that I was not seated in the window seat that I had previously booked. This was also the case for my flight from Toronto to Munich, as I had booked beside my friend flying from another city for that flight and we were at opposite ends of the plane. Then we sat at the gate in Calgary for over an hour once boarding was completed with no reasonable explanation for the delay - thankfully I had a 5 hour layover. I am a loyal customer to Air Canada and Star Alliance and I choose to fly with them above other airlines, but experiences like this that make me question my loyalty.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Munich via Toronto,March 2015,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,no

Delta Air Lines,5.0,Iain Bagwell,25th December 2015,"Mechanical issues out of BHM on A320, but we were updated every few mins by cabin crew-which eased the tension as I only had a 42 minute connection in ATL. Just about made the connection. Overall not bad on the eastbound legs. Food outstanding out of ATL. Good service, a little stand off-ish, but generally good. Arrived LHR 40 mins early. No Line at fast track and bags already on carousel so overall a good experience. LHR-BHM wasn't quite so smooth. Food terrible & this is not an understatement. I had baked cod that was described as crispy, but in fact was chewy and slightly rancid, so I didn't eat it. As I usually find eating in a plane more of a diversion than anything else I was happy to pass on the food. My son chose basil tortellini but bizarrely came in a cream green curry sauce. Not sure what the were thinking when they came up with this menu. Not nearly as good as Eastboud USA origination. My wife had the oxtail that she said was really nice, so I guess my son and I just made poor choices. Service (apart from 1 FA) could only be described as frosty. Landed ATL 20 mins early. Security a breeze. Now the fun begins. I picked up a text from DL to inform me connection was delayed by 45 mins, no big deal here, but as it was last flight out on Xmas eve and seeing the lines for rebooking I was starting to get a bad feeling. Then the flight delayed another hour. The heart starts to pound a little more, then 15 mins before boarding and it gets cancelled. Was then given 2 options 9.55pm on Xmas day or 6.10, but couldn't accommodate all 3 of us so we would have to choose who was in which flight. Really! Delta sucks when it comes to these type of occurrences. Yes, the delay was weather related and was mostly out of their control, but to have no reasonable back up plan is poor. They had already cancelled one of the earlier ATL-BHM flights, so surely could have anticipated this a little better. In the end I managed to get a car from Avis and drive myself, so all was not lost. If I had taken Delta's option I'd no doubt be feeling a little like Tom Hanks in the 'traveller'! To be fair to Delta they did offer a hotel for the night. I think I'm more frustrated that it was Xmas, than anything else.",A320 / Boeing 767,Family Leisure,Business Class,BHM to LHR via ATL,December 2015,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,yes
American Airlines,2.0,W Gearan,10th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Orlando to Kahului. Customer service training must happen or happen more frequently. I have flown many times on business trips and with my family. I have never experienced what we experienced this trip. Our flight to Florida was okay. On our way back home, we were checking in at the Orlando Airport. A AA agent told us that we had to check in our Sit & Stand stroller. We told her that it was never a problem coming and all the past times we traveled. She said that at this airport, we had no choice and had to check it in. I went to ask another AA agent. I politely said, ""Good morning Maam"" to get her attention. She looked at me and said, ""Uuuggg"", you are the second person that called me Maam today! What do you want?"" I looked at her and said, ""I'll ask someone else"". Can you imagine the things you need to carry while traveling with two children? This made it very difficult to travel with two young children to say the least. When passing through TSA, we asked what the deal was and they said, it was okay with TSA. They check and allow any type of stroller. We got up to our gate and we saw one family on the flight before us who had the same exact Sit & Stand stroller and had no questions asked and strolled right into the jet way. I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed. I found that hard to believe as another family checked in a double stroller (wider and more bulky than what we had). I looked around and noticed that we were the only family without our stroller. When we got to Texas, the AA agent was so rude. We asked if our family could sit closer together. She asked for my boarding pass. Since my wife had it, I asked if I could show her a picture on my phone. She looked at me and said, ""I don't want to hold you phone. Phones are full of germs."" I didn't want her to hold my phone anyway, but what a thing to tell a guest. Phones could be full of germs, but you don't need to say that to a guest.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,T Thompson,10th April 2015,From ORD-IST and back in economy. Row 16 and 22 respectively. Our first experience with Turkish. We requested vegetarian meals and a gluten free meal for my sister we all had excellent food and even had fresh squeezed orange juice (at least on the IST-ORD leg). The seats were comfortable too with a recline and a second option to slide the seat bottom outward giving more of a natural reclined feeling allowing better sleep without cramping the person behind you! Hot towels before the meal (I still love these simple things) and Turkish delight before service. The entertainment selection was good movies could have had a better selection but the music was fantastic. From the overall comfort and food quality I was able to sleep for 5 hours on a 9.5 hour night trip. I never sleep that much in economy! I believe their aircraft's sacrifice a few of the bathrooms for food/beverage/storage. It seems the bathrooms get used a bit more though there are never lines. The flight crew kept the bathrooms cleaned several times during the journeys. I would definitely fly them again mainly from the food and comfort perspective.

The flight left slightly later than scheduled due to the late arrival of the aircraft. This flight is a 5th freedom flight from SIN to DPS as the flight originated in AMS. I was In seat 1A and was very impressed with the seat. Highly adjustable to whatever position you want. There is power available to charge your electronics. The seat was a little dirty but I put this down to it not being the first flight and the tight turnaround, nothing abhorrent. The only downside is the immovable ottoman footrest. If you are under 5â€™7â€ you may struggle to reach it. The inflight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies and tv shows as well as an interactive map showing you the route. It was much more responsive than other IFE systems that I have used recently and the remote is touch screen which helps a lot. The food was respectable for such a short flight, with two choices for the main, either chicken or beef with all the trimmings. Altogether when the salad and desert it was very tasty and the crew kept filling up drinks and offering bread rolls. I was surprised to get a meal on this flight but I was glad I did. The crew themselves were very happy which was pleasant and they were very attentive. The KLM houses were a unique experience as no other airlines do this. I got house number 28 and it is filled with a Dutch Gin. Overall it was a nice flight compared to the competitors on the route and was very well priced for a business product.

American Airlines,1.0,S Fell,18th December 2014,Flight from Chicago to Paris on Thurs (12/5/14) was nothing but miserable. AA brought two planes to the gate when neither could pass safety inspection. The big question is why the planes made it to the gate in the first place. Passengers were then told that another plane had been found (another gate) but it needed to be inspected cleaned and finally loaded - they did provide soda and pretzels during the 3.5+ hour wait (big deal). We finally boarded a not-too-clean plane (I found trash in the seat pocket) and it was cold for the entire trip. We saw the staff twice - once to serve what they call dinner and once when they served a cold breakfast. The trip was just plain awful and makes me want to give up travel by air altogether. One bright spot that has nothing to do with AA - it was a SMOOTH flight and we made it in record time due to a good tail wind.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no

American Airlines,5.0,Liam Wills,14th January 2015,AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

That was only the beginning, due to late departure from Tel Aviv, we arrived late to Istnbul just to see our connecting flight push out of the gate (15 minutes earlier to take off time), we went to the Turkish Airlines desk, who told us we need to go to the transfer desk.

I asked to speak to a manager on duty to explain that the wait is 9 hours at night, we went to speak to a staff member but after letting us wait for 10 minutes he informed us that he is not a manager, and if we want to speak to one we need to go through immigration to the Turkish Airlines desk they will help us. We did so only to realize that there was nothing there. We needed to go back through immigration and went again to the desk to try to understand what we are expected to do in the 9 hours wait. The clerk informed us that we will be able to go to the Millennium lounge but only from 22:00 and until then we can get a complimentary meal from any restaurant in the terminal - which turned out to be false, only Burger king accepted the voucher for a lousy restricted basic meal.

Air Canada,1.0,D Cain,23rd November 2017,âœ… Trip Verified | Booked Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver for December. My complaint is the manner in which Air Canada has increased the price of their fares by offering reduced seat fares through travel web sites (e.g. Expedia) only to underhandedly force the purchaser to pay for selecting a seat either before or during check-in and paying for every piece of luggage. This practice is deceiving and dishonest. I have come to appreciate airlines who are forthright in their pricing practices through travel web sites and have flown many that are completely above board. It is unfortunate that we are serviced by so few airlines in Canada that this type of price gouging is allowed to continue. I will take every opportunity to fly another airline including non-domestic airlines other than fly Air Canada or its discount equivalent Rouge.,Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Ottawa via Vancouver,November 2017,,,,,2.0,1.0,no
Emirates,4.0,Alastair Finch,5th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Christchurch to Sydney. After our Qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the Emirates desk being checked in for EK413 to Sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience. We have flown Emirates before and had reservations which had led us to avoid them for this trip to New Zealand. Unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. The plane was brilliant, newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. The main problem is with the service and staff. Business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. When I informed the attendant that I did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. I did not have a dedicated attendAnt for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. No hot drinks were served after the meal. If you are paying a business class fare you expect value for money.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,S Karinski,10th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Edmonton to Seattle. The flight was delayed for 5 hours. That was the worst part. We were promptly notified that there was a technical issue with the plane and that there would initially be a 30 minute delay. After 30 minutes we had to deplane. The flight crew was professional and extremely helpful. As soon as we got off the plane they were already distributing snacks, drinks, coloring books for the kids, and also some playing cards. Throughout the ordeal the station attendants were helpful, even when passenger tensions were rising, they remained professional. They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels. The seats were highly comfortable and had excellent recline as well. There was no seatback entertainment, however, there were magazines provided.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,K Strouse,23rd June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Tampa to Raleigh-Durham. Kudos to Delta for going above and beyond. I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option. WiFi was provided though I did not attempt to use it so cannot comment on speed.

When Alaska has only delayed 10% at most during my 6 years going the same route. I really want Air Canada management to take a hard look at why they cannot be on time more often on the same route that Alaska does.

Emirates,6.0,C Down,1st March 2016,"Chauffeur pick up worked excellently, and is a really nice touch. The lounge at Birmingham was fairly small but large enough for the number of passengers and with good food and drink. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was on an old 777, and the 777 business product isn't as good as the product on other airlines for this length flight. The seats aren't fully flat nor do they have direct aisle access. As this was also an old plane the in flight entertainment was fairly poor. While the screen was enormous, the resolution was very low and the controls were frustratingly difficult. The cabin crew were fine without being outstandanding as was the food. The lounge at Dubai was very good as we were in a smaller one rather than the main central one. The food and drink offering was very good and I liked that some of the bar was self service. Dubai to Mumbai was on a newer 777 and the entertainment was much better. As this was a short flight through the night there is not too much to say, although the cabin crew were fairly good, they did insist on waking up passengers who had ordered food then clearly changed their mind and fallen asleep (it was 4am). Spending a long time trying to wake them up, not just a quick tap or hello. Arriving in Mumbai was fairly easy with prompt processing on the ground. The chauffeur pick up worked well although could have been better organised at the airport itself as you just had to look around the busy bundle of Emirates chauffeurs trying to find your name.

I'm a petite person and was miserably cramped in a small seat the food was disgusting and the most of the staff acted like those of us in economy class were an imposition. Two women who chatted loudly for 12 of the 14-hour predominately evening flight were not asked to lower their voices so that others could sleep the in-service entertainment a small screen inserted in the back of the seat ahead of us was dark and virtually impossible to see and although staff did pick up trash after meals they didn't after serving various beverages so we were left sitting in rubbish for the duration of the flight.

After reservation was made and tickets were issued, airlines unexpectedly change our flight time, flight date and flight number, and this happened several times. It caused us having to change hotel and other reservations several times, and having to stay at some cities longer (or shorter). Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago. As for the flights themselves, they were ok. Service was ok, a bit inconsistent on some flights. Some planes were older, others are newer. Cabins and bathrooms were clean, seats were comfortable.

United Airlines,1.0,Brian Fox,22nd July 2015,"On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home.

Qatar Airways,9.0,A Hafiri,28th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Paris CDG to Doha. Qatar Airways is such a nice airline to fly with. From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner. The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest.

American Airlines,8.0,W Neale,6th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York to Sydney via Charlotte / Los Angeles. Unremarkable or even bad service is frankly the norm on pretty much every airline in the US, with certain well-known exceptions. To expect anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment, as reflected by the majority of reviews for this airline. Yes, I too have experienced the dreaded day-long weather delay, but I still fly American because they handled the situation as well as could be expected and they don't control the weather. I flew from New York to Sydney with layovers in Charlotte and Los Angeles. My domestic short-haul flights were unremarkable. I had a tight connection in Charlotte (40 minutes) which I made with no problem thanks to helpful ground staff. Both flights were on older 737s without seatback or BYOD IFE. On the flight from JFK to CLT this was fine, but the 5 hour flight from CLT to LAX would have been unpleasant had I not had my own stuff on hand. Legroom on both flights was more than adequate. I am 6 feet tall, somewhat overweight, and had no issues with personal space. American's hard product is easily my personal favorite of the big three, even on older aircraft. Beverage service was brusque and impersonal, as is the norm, but flight attendants were very good in a one-on-one setting. There were frequent advertisements for AA-branded credit cards on both flights, taking the form of promotional videos and several in-flight announcements from flight attendants. Some announcements alluded to cardholder benefits not actually provided by the card, so be wary of that should you find the offer enticing, but I believe this was more a misunderstanding of the product by the FAs than a willful attempt to deceive. All in all, American's domestic service is perfectly reasonable, provided you have realistic expectations of what an airline is and isn't capable of doing. American's long haul international service greatly exceeded my admittedly minimal expectations. My flight from LAX to Sydney, clocking in at a whopping 15 hours, was a brand new 787-900 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy, a definite improvement over the 3-4-3 layout found on most American long haul metal. The seat provided ample legroom and storage space. Carry-on bins were large and easily accessible. IFE was provided by a large, high definition seatback screen. The selection was enormous, but leaned much more heavily to films over TV. The in-flight map is better than most US carriers. The interface for the IFE is somewhat frustrating at first. The default layout requires frequent swiping and dragging, which the touch screen is not very good at. This can be fixed by switching to a grid based display system, which I did not discover was an option until we were close to landing. There was also a catalogue of music and books available though the system, but the selection was not very good. Dinner and breakfast were served to all passengers on this flight. Meals were surprisingly good, being flavorful and well-portioned in both instances. I enjoyed about 7 hours of rest on this flight, which is much better than the 2 or 3 I generally manage to hobble together flying to Europe. The 787 is a wonderful aircraft, and is easily my first choice when flying overseas. All in all, my round trip flight from New York to Sydney cost $1400 per person, an excellent value. I would fly American again, both domestically and internationally.",Boeing 737-700 / 787-9,Business,Economy Class,New York to Sydney via Charlotte / LAX,February 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Aeromexico,1.0,Peter Marxen,23rd February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Amsterdam to Huatulco via Mexico City. We were travelling as a family with 2 adult and 3 teenagers. The best thing about Aeromexico would be the staff service on the planes. The seats were not that comfortable. Our further plane to Huatulco was cancelled without any information. We asked other passengers to get information. At the counter before flying to Huatulco, we stood together in one group, telling we are a family. 3 of us were picked for leaving with the plane and the staff told my wife and daughter to go to the next counter for solving some practical problems. Their boarding were torn apart. After a while my wife and daugther were told they could not go on the airplane?! My daugther started to cry and my wife got very worried because she is not used to travel and many people, new places are very hard to cope for her. Two of my children were sitting on the plane, and I had to fight for getting my minor children off the plane again. I felt lucky to get my teenagers off the plane again. It was very stressful and Aeromexico ruined the first half of our holidays in Mexico. Afterwards we thought we could compensation for a lunch or the cancelled flight.

The food was very good on the Vancouver-Mexico City legs, the entertainment was plentiful, flight attendants were checking on passenger needs all the time and the planes were immaculate.

American Airlines,1.0,Mary Carbajal,21st June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew United Airlines from Los Angeles to Kahului. From the moment I stepped out of the car every employee was so rude. I selected seats when I made the reservation. They disappeared. I had to go to the customer service counter. At Los Angeles there were 2, yes only 2 employees at the counter. I was surrounded by self-service kiosks that would not address my issue. The line was incredibly long. An employee told me to go outside to the curb and use the curbside service to check in. I approached the employee and asked if he could check us in. He could not give me a direct answer. He had a terrible attitude and was condescending and rude. When he finally looked up the reservation he said he could not check us in because there was a problem. We went back to the line and started over again. Finally at the counter we got checked in. On the plane things didn't get any better. The service was so bad. The passenger next to me was traveling with a young child seated across the aisle. We moved around so the child could be sitting with one of his parents. The passenger asked if he could have 2 tiny snacks. The flight attendant adamantly refused stating only 1 was allowed. The passenger on my right asked the attendant if she could take her cup of water away. The attendant said - ""I can't do that right now"" and never returned. Granted these are minor issues but the attitude of every single employee was so rude. This is a service industry. There are so many choices. This was by far the worst choice I have made. I booked 5 tickets and selected seats. My seat assignment disappeared and we were randomly seated. This was the beginning of a very unpleasant flight.

Movies were up to date and seat width and legroom was decent. Comfortable cabin atmosphere on the long-haul legs and good cabin service. My requests for snacks and ice cream were honored and added satisfaction to the flight. The repeated on-screen play of the menu was disruptive to IFE though. Appreciated the youth and gentleness of in-flight staff especially on the short-haul flights. Even the short-haul flights had delectable snacks. The only trouble was the since-decommissioned Doha International Airport was not sufficient to handle QR's busy network and operations.

Air New Zealand,6.0,Gersten Zvia,9th March 2015,2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would co-op with these extra hours had it not be for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. The disrespect and disregard to it's passengers is shameful. There is no room for peoples' legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples' health as well. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants were beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots are tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. People stared in disbelief. However when we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flying attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United. Our son who was wiser flew Air New Zealand and he mocked us for choosing United.

Air New Zealand,,Christopher Bollas,5th August 2013,LAX to LHR on 27 July back 1 August. Would be a fine airline but with one profound exception. There is no air- flow in the cabin. Flight attendant she said they had no control over the air circulation only over the temperature. On some 777's one does have access to an air nozzle to supply flow to oneself on most however it is indeed controlled by the airline. Flat bed in business is comic but entertaining in its own way. No instruction manual comes with the seat so it is sort of 'figure it out for yourself'. To get the dining table to emerge (it is at foot level to the right) you have to reach over your left shoulder to a button which you push which then releases the table. You then have to tug at knee level the large table up and out and okay all is fine. By the way they are not seats but more like a bed that can be shot up into some sort of seating position. Not comfortable to sit in. However once you get this seat to go flat and once you have put the several inch thick mattress pads on the seat you have a fantastic bed. I am one of those 4 million mile flyers and not given to complaint. I have never flown ANZ before and will not again until they sort out the basics. That said the enthusiasm of the Kiwis on board the joy of families going for the 'long haul' and the no fuss upbeat nature of the crew is wonderful.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,2.0,M Pflaum,25th November 2015,"My trip started off a little rocky. Understandably, my flight was originally delayed two hours due to a passenger being sick. From there, bad weather caused my flight to be detoured and grounded in Kansas for 1+ hours before resuming the flight to Texas. During this entire flight time, we were only served drinks once (at the very beginning of the flight), and the flight was short on food due to the previous delay due to sickness. Therefore us passengers went 7+ hours with only one beverage service, and no available food. When we landed, we were all scrambling to reach our connecting delayed flights, if they hadn't been cancelled at that point yet. Luckily, I reached my gate in time, waited an hour, before realizing people were slowly disappearing even though there had been no announcement stating my flight had been cancelled (this was at 12AM). After inquiring if my flight was in fact cancelled, I was also told that every single flight to my destination was booked the next day with no openings on any flights for over a day. Desperate, I asked how I could get closer to my destination. I was put on standby for a 1:30AM flight out, and told I could take a 2 hour bus ride to my destination in the morning. Once again, upon landing at 2:30 in the morning, we were left unable to unload for one hour because flights were backed up. I get that weather happens, but the customer service to this point was terrible, and we never once receiving anything to drink. Once when I landed, I figured I should find out where my bus would be leaving from before finding a spot on the floor to close my eyes for a few hours. I was told by an airport worker I was in the right location, so I stopped my search and found my place on the floor. Waking up an hour and fifteen minutes early, just to be sure I wasn't given the wrong information, I began questioning where this bus would exactly turn up. After talking to 5 different people and being told 5 different places I should go to catch my bus, an American Airlines employee sent me all the way across the airport to a place where my bus was not taking off from, and no one could answer any of my questions. So, I returned to American Airlines, and finally my patience was spent. I explained my story, showed them my tickets, and the employee replied that in the ten years that they had worked there, they had never seen this bus ticket option before. Then after spending ten minutes making phone calls, they realized this bus service had in fact been around for 2 years. Never once did I receive an apology for being sent all around the airport, when this could've been solved by admitting they were unsure where this bus left from and making a phone call to find out the answer. I then had a 4 hour layover at the airport, before finally boarding a bus to my final destination. Arriving 17 hours later than I should have. I understand that we can't control the weather, and things happen. My issue with this experience was the awful customer service.

When we got to our gate at 7:00 p.m we were told to go to another gate halfway across the airport because our gate had be changed. After going to the new location and seating there for about 45 minutes. We were told that our gate had changed back to the gate we were originally at. Finally we get to board the plane around 8:45. The pilot comes over the intercom and says ""please take your seats we only have 6 minutes before our crew times out. At this time the fuel truck had just pulled up. After about 10 minutes. The pilot comes back on the intercom and tells us that the crew has times out and that they were not going to be able to fly us to Denver. So the pilots exit the plane. 10 minutes later the flight attendant come on and say ""we have a new fight crew on the way and we will be leaving as soon as they get here"". 45 minutes to an hour later after sitting on the plane she comes back on only to tell us that there was no new crew and we needed to get off the plane. Now it's around 11:00-11:30. After about an hour of sitting at the gate waiting to hear of any updates. They tell us there's a new fight crew is coming and we would be leaving as soon as they arrived and do there pre-flight checks. So around 12:15 or so the new crew starts to arrive. First 1 pilot, 20 minutes later another pilot, 20 later the engineer comes. I guess. They tell us we will be taking off shortly. Around 1:15 a.m or so. They tell us the the flight attendants have now timed out and our flight would be canceled. It's funny now but not really. They then tell us that we have to go back to the other gate to rebook our flights out. Luckily for us we knew the number to call for rebooking. So we were able to get on the next flight out at 6:45 Tuesday morning. My wife tells me today that they gave her a $100 voucher. Not only did they know they were going to have to cancel the flight but they were dishonest and didn't have to decency to tell us the truth. I have not received anything for them nor do I care to.

Emirates,6.0,C Baxter,17th March 2015,Dubai to Sydney Economy Class. After reading other postings here for Emirates just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see but a poor selection in English unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe.

I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,no

Emirates,7.0,Z Myklebust,5th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Munich to Durban via Dubai. My trip to my son's wedding started with the chauffeur driver arriving late, apparently because of having been given the incorrect collection time. The flight from Durban to Dubai was comfortable and the FAs worked flat out to deal with a full flight. It was very useful to receive information on the gates for our connecting flights, before we landed. The comfortable facilities of Terminal A at Dubai made for a very pleasant wait. The boarding and flight to Munich on the A380 was seamless, with the bonus of the best chauffeur drive experience and facilities to my son's home, that I have had. The return trip from Germany to Durban was equally enjoyable and pleasant.

American Airlines,2.0,Ginger Stickel,3rd April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | My family and I had the misfortune of taking a connecting flight from La Guardia through Miami to get to Belize (a number of people on our flight were Belize bound, and others were St Thomas bound). We experienced one and a half hour delays on the day of our flight, first due to a problem by maintenance bringing the plane from the hanger to the gate, and then with baggage loading since we'd missed our scheduled boarding time. Though the pilot tried to make up time (45 minutes), American Airlines, knowing it was a flight full of connecting passengers, and that people like my husband were Platinum Executive, chose to ground us for 30 minutes because they'd made the decision to re-sell our seats after the mishap AA caused at LGA during our one and a half hour delay. It cause many of us to miss our connecting flights, which were the last flight of the day. Perhaps worse is that the pilot and flight attendants made announcements that those on our flight not connecting should remain seated because they were holding our flights. My kids and I ran 20 gates to arrive at our connecting gate 12 minutes before scheduled departure and were refused entry to the plane because the gate agent told us he had already sold our seats (we were meeting friends on the connecting flight who told us that they sold our seats 50 minutes before scheduled departure). What is worse is that we incurred many expenses by missing 24 hours of our vacation including hotel, tour group, private shuttle, plus hotel in Miami last minute during spring break. The airline has said they've officially classified it as ""Air Traffic Control"" even though the pilot repeatedly told us there was an issue getting our plane from the hanger (it didn't come from another city) and that there was a problem loading baggage. We never waited on the tarmac, except after we landed when he said AA didn't have a gate open. The airline treated us like prisoners and unethically chose to profit from our delay caused by maintenance and baggage in NY by re-selling our seats. I would not ever recommend an airline that makes decisions to screw over passengers in this manner. Its unethical and means bad management is at the heart of it.",,Family Leisure,First Class,La Guardia to Belize via Miami,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses.

Once I got to my gate they said the overhead was full so I had to check in my carry on. I wasn't too happy. They promised me the overhead was full and there was no way around it. I finally caved and complained so they didn't charge me. So I basically would have paid to check in my first suitcase for nothing.

Aeromexico,,S Anthony,26th June 2010,LAX to PVR. It's unethical to say the least. AeroMexico had a good selection of non-stop flights from LAX to PVR. Seats were more expensive than connecting flights on the U.S. based airlines. We were willing to pay extra for the non-stop flight. A week before our departure AeroMexico moved us to an indirect flight connecting through Mexico City. Our only other option was accepting a voucher from AeroMexico and rebooking on another airline at our own expense. Due to the short notice all flights (even connecting) were two to three times more expensive than they were when we had originally purchased the tickets. The annoyance doesn't end there. In Mexico City we only had one hour to change planes. Normally this would be easy. We didn't know we had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people already in line. Needless to say we missed our connection. We waited all day in the airport for another flight that had seats available.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,no

My flight experience from YUL to MUC left me with a bit of mixed feelings. Even though the flight is not that long approx. 7 hrs the plane was fully packed with people and the seats were really uncomfortable. It was not possible to move around and not even sleep. Furthermore the passenger in front of me considered her right to keep her seat not in the fully upright position during the entire flight leaving me with very limited space. And when I asked the flight attendants to tell her to bring her seat a bit further up so as to have some space myself I was taken by surprise to hear that they could not wake her up and that I should simply do the same or change seat (I seat that I had pre-selected and paid).

Aegean Airlines,2.0,C Bartzelis,6th November 2014,I have travelled from Athens to Tirana every week for the past two years and I see it more as a torture rather than a journey. It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30â€™mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat.

We were promised a baby crib at check-in, then told that they only had one onboard and someone else had it, no infant seat belts so baby just sat on your our lap - dreadful service. On 2nd internal flight from Newark to Miami, 3 seats allocated to us were scatted throughout the plane, we are a family of 2 adults 1 child (5) and a baby. This should not be allowed and after complaining they gave us 3 together. Service onboard was much better than the international flight with great attendants. 3rd internal flight Miami to Newark the worst with very rude staff on the check-in desk who ignored us for about 10-15 minutes. Again we requested an infant cot for our international flight and were told we had it as we were one of the first to check in, flight delayed and only just made our connection to 4th flight by seconds. Asked for our sky cot only to be told sorry someone asked for it on the plane and they had given it to them. I said I was unhappy as we requested it 6hrs ago and were met with very rude cabin staff.

First 2 flights was not charged or asked to pay for drinks per upgrade. 3rd flight got 1st drink, asked for 2nd drink and was asked to pay.

AA implemented Main Cabin Extra over a year ago and notified employees as per their web site of what MCE seats are entitled to. Was told in communication, sorry, multiple times. I had asked for some type of reimbursement or credit for another flight because of their lack of offering what people expect for upgraded seats and paid for. AA has what I feel is blockers just to tell you sorry, hoping you go away. I feel to tell everyone through here to ask and get what you are entitled to for what you pay for with AA with upgraded seats. In my last email, I was told sorry again, in that I didn't get as many drinks as I wanted. Well, that upset me even more. Was told in email that an attempt was made to contact me via phone. I was called, answered and no one responded. No attempt to call me again or leave voice mail or email me telling me so.

Alitalia,4.0,S Raythlie,28th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I chose to fly with Alitalia to Tokyo as they were the cheapest carrier at the time, and being a student it has to be the cheapest! Due to delay issues, we did not fly out with Alitalia, but flew them on the return from Tokyo to London via Rome. The flight from Tokyo was alright, nothing more nothing less. I did not expect much paying a cheap fare and I would not say it was drastically worse than other economy class on average. Legroom was fairly poor, the entertainment system was a bit outdated and the food was okay except they ran out of choice by the time they reached me. However what do you expect when you pay just over Â£400 return. So 8/10 for the price paid. Ground service on the way out was awful. We checked in and reached the gate for our outbound flight to Rome. After a delay of an hour we are told that the flight was cancelled. By this stage I knew getting to Tokyo would be awkward as we would miss our connection. Normally an airline will re-route you the quickest route to your destination and often with a partner airline. This did not happen whatsoever. There was a 2 hour wait to get re-routed and once at the front we were told we would be re-routed the following day - no compensation, no food voucher and a hotel night was all that was offered. The staff were rude and did not seem to know what they were doing. I believed they were stressed and waited for everybody to be re-routed then came back to challenge them for a better re-route. After an hour of telling the staff about what Skyteam was and their partnership with other airlines they finally started to look for an earlier flight. However again the staff were clueless and did not know about other routes, it was I looking up flight numbers and partner airlines myself and showing them on my phone that finally got us re-routed on Korean Air via Seoul. Leaving us with an 8 hour delay rather than 24 hours. So Alitalia are worth the price if you know what you are doing when you travel. If you're an anxious traveller or new to flying I would not recommend them purely on the basis that if something goes wrong it would not be a pleasurable experience. Just make sure that if you are ever delayed ensure that you get food vouchers and know of any possible re-routes and ask for one kindly once everybody else has already been re-routed, otherwise their stress = shouting at you and not wanting to help.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,NRT to LHR via FCO,January 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,no

They donâ€™t even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they donâ€™t have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didnâ€™t offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs.

The IFE was extensive and up-to-date. The food on the LAX-LHR route was good, although the red-eye return haul had a breakfast that I mostly left. When flying into LAX the boarding was a little chaotic - whilst Group 1 boarding were announced, after this no information was given, leaving the rest of us to guess when we went to board. On the flight itself, crew were friendly at first but after about 2-3 hours into the flight they clearly were tired and it reflected on their manner as I felt like I was irritating them every time I asked for a drink when they came down the aisles, which did feel a little intimidating to me. Thankfully, my flight back was much better organised in boarding and crew were very friendly throughout the flight.

United Airlines,1.0,Kathee Miller,25th January 2014,I purchased first class tickets hoping to make the experience a little better it didn't help. The food on the flight is horrible. You get a snack box which consists of a couple of crackers some cheese spread a fig cookie and some kind of cranberry bar. That is not first class service to me. To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place. This took about 24 hours when it should have taken 2. To make matters even worse on the flight home my bags didn't make it again. I was told they got put on the later flight. I won't be flying United anymore.,,,First Class,,,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Clean and refurbished planes, you don't notice that they are almost thirty years old (Boeing 767-300ER). Flights almost on time (one hour late out of Toronto due to snowstorm). Smooth Atlantic crossing, tasty food and beverages/wine for free. All seats with individual screens. Nice, helpful flight attendants and good information from cockpit.

Too bad my return to YYZ on flt 1116 on June 23 was not the same. None of the crew bothered to introduce themselves. Declined the lunch again due to health issues and asked for a sandwich instead. Told I would have to pay the $7.00 odd for the sandwich I was brought from economy! It was almost impossible to get a top up of my wine as the crew were safely ensconced behind the tightly closed front galley curtain and could be heard giggling away like school girls (all male crew). I have usually received excellent service in J but made to pay for a chicken roll sandwich was over the top I hope this is not going to be the norm on AC otherwise Westjet here I come.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,no

Delta Air Lines,4.0,Fidelis Kamuntu,28th November 2015,"I'm not a kind of traveler that ever complains or ever taken a survey to evaluate the quality of service. Today however is different. I've been pushed to the limit and will make a note, of the terrible service that I've received on Delta. I'm on flight AF9301 seat 41H from Minneapolis to Paris CDG. Flight attendant takes the poor Delta service to a new low. First, she is ramming her food cart onto seats and passengers shoulders and proceeds with no remorse or even a simple excuse me. Just passed with a drinks cart, looks like she looks at faces, and chooses who she will ask if they need a drink or not. She clearly ignored me as I awaited to get a drink, and I must say, I have never felt disrespected this much. I had to politely ask another attendant if drinks were for purchase or complementary, just to calm my head. Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman. When I asked why the attendants seemed so disrespectful, a senior attendant mentioned something along the lines of staffing etc, which I personally, thought was an excuse, as the aircraft seemed to be less than half full. If had a choice, I would never fly Delta again. Unfortunately Delta is too big an airline, that my choices are narrowed and I keep finding myself on Delta flights.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Paris,November 2015,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,A Bigelow,1st June 2014,YVR-HKG on 777 High Density configuration. Everyone must avoid this 777! Even if this flight was a few hundred dollars less than competition (which it's not) I'd still avoid it. I am Elite Air Canada and would never fly this plane (trying to see if I can change my return flight). Seats are so cramped that it shames low-cost airlines not only you do you not have enough room but the seats are also very uncomfortable the controls are inaccessible (on the armrests) and recline is very limited. Due to extreme high density service is slow and very poor there's no duty free on a 14hr flight! There's absolutely not enough lavatories for the number of people this plane carries.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,J Mackay,10th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | This was my first time flying Delta International from Milan to New York and I have to say I am impressed with their service and the attention to detail provided by the aircrew. I was hoping to get their signature airplane, the new Airbus 350 however the equipment we flew in Airbus 330 was very nice. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants if I could move to an empty row and she was very nice and said to me that I could grab any seat I wished so I went on and sat on an empty row of 2. I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they canâ€™t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure. I must make an observation about Deltaâ€™s new ""Comfort Seat"" Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s worth the money because I did not see a difference between that seat and the one I had. I hope they expand to premium economy on more flights. Overall I give Delta two thumbs up!",A330-300,Business,Economy Class,Milan to New York,November 2017,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,yes

We realized that Toronto was limited by a closed runway and asked to be rerouted the night before but were assured that we would make our connecting flight. Despite our plane sitting outside of the gate in Charlotte we were delayed over two hours going to Toronto due to a lack of landing slots since Toronto was down to a single runway. Canadian flights have priority over US. Luckily, we were able to get four seats (not together) on the next morning's flight to London from Toronto but we had to spend a long, cold, uncomfortable night in the Toronto airport. Air Canada offered no accommodations for us due to this delay. The return flight was almost as bad. Our two hour layover in Toronto was barely enough time to get through security and customs and get out to the end of the terminal for our connecting flight home.

Jetblue Airways,1.0,J Stanton,9th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Boston. I would recommend staying away from Jetblue. I really don't think they know what they are doing. I flew with them in January 2018 for the first time as Travelocity gave me this airline option. I was stuck at the FLL airport for an over 6 hour delay. The staff kept giving different reasons as to why the plane was late, they offered junk food as a consolation, and ultimately, it was chaos and very anxiety-provoking. Now, I know they travel a lot to the east coast and it was January, which would likely cause some flight delays. So, I figured I could be fair and give them another try later on as they did give me a $100 flight credit, per their bill of rights. I was very anxious about it, so for about a month before my flight, I checked my flight every single night that I'd be flying on to see if there were major delays again. I needed to be mentally prepared and if it looked rough, I was just going to pay for something else. Well, other than most Saturdays and one Friday, the flight from Nashville to Boston (7:37 PM departure time) was delayed. However, it was at most about a three hour delay, at best 30 minutes. I was mentally prepared, though, and ready for my likely at worst 3 hour delay. I mean, I live in Nashville, so no biggied if I am delayed out of my own city but what a surprise when I get a text that my 7:37 PM flight was delayed until 12:54 AM! We didn't leave Nashville until 2:19 AM! I got into Boston at 6:30 AM and I should have been there at 11:00 PM the night prior. So, my Saturday was very rough considering I only had 2 hours of airplane sleep. When I had talked with customer service during the delay fiasco, they were of no help. One rep literally told me ""good luck"" and hung up. Also, I am glad I didn't try to get on the flight that next morning from Nashville to Boston because it was cancelled. I felt so lucky that I didn't trust Jetblue enough to book them for my flight home. I flew Southwest home and of course, no problems, per usual. So, I'd stay away from Jetblue. I gave them a second chance and it was basically the same situation as the first time I flew with them. I learned my lesson.

Emirates,5.0,G Whyte,31st May 2015,Flew to Perth stopping off in Dubai. Not overly impressed with Business Class Lounge in Heathrow a very limited breakfast. Boarded their new A380 and it was fabulous. I thought I was in First Class initially. Very comfortable and spacious seat and huge screen and many up to date films to watch. Very pleasant and efficient cabin crew who dispensed hot flannels (face cloths) regularly. The food was excellent and the bar at the back well words pass me. 18 year old Chivas Regal and top class nibbles (nuts and savoury biscuits). The entire flight was a singular joy and if you are using Emirates do try to upgrade if an A380 is the plane being used. Even the US pilot (he told us) seemed to have a purr of happiness to be flying this wonderful beast. So why the low assessments I hear you asking? Well it started going downhill after disembarking. Had to undergo another bag and body security check (not Emirates fault). Then the nightmare trying to find the gate for the second flight. I was given so much false information. Finally got to check in which was slow and ponderous and another bag and body security check. This time a Boeing 777. Oh! what a difference. It was old tired worn out and uncomfortable. The seat could lie flat but was very narrow preventing changing positions when sleeping. The television screen was significantly smaller too. The cabin crew were very friendly and pleasant and the food was good (just as well I like fish though). The difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777 was astounding.

I have never lost a bag or had a bag put on the wrong flight until I flew this airline. Not only do they over charge for checked bags they mishandle them and treat you like itâ€™s not their fault. Iâ€™ve always been weary of this airline because of their tendency to have their name in the news for negative reasons. This flight has been a prime example of why I will avoid United Airlines for the rest of my life. From Punta Cana to ORD there was hardly any service and they took thirty minutes to get us off the plane. We had a two hour layover in ORD which should have given us plenty of time to get our bags, go through customs, recheck our bag, go through security, and get something to eat before our next flight",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aisles on the plane were fairly crowded, but it took a short amount of time to get to our seats in the back of the plane. When we sat down, the seat was pretty comfortable. However, the seat cushion moved a little bit, because of the life vest underneath, but it was barely noticeable. The takeoff was pretty smooth, and after a few minutes we were at cruising altitude. The first drink/snack service came out about 1 hour into the flight. After the snack, I turned on the inflight entertainment system.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Nouf Fuoad,5th November 2015,"In the past 3 years I have flown Turkish Airlines 3 times. Each experience was worse than the one before. My main issue was the attitude and rudeness of staff. The staff also had a hard time understanding and speaking English. The ladies in their customer service call center are unhelpful and one was very rude. I had to call several times due to many issues, and each phone call was much longer than it should be because of the language barrier and their unwillingness to simply do their job. The business lounge at Istanbul airport is beautiful - made ugly by the rude staff. Extremely unhelpful. A man beside us asked for the wi-fi password (after he just sat down, unpacked, hooked up his electronics) and the lounge staff rudely told him to go ask at the desk. The wi-fi password was on a table tent on the very table. Close to my flight time, I went to ask the concierge about my boarding time and flight gate (since it wasn't on the ticket), she pointed at the ticked in my hand and condescendingly asked ""you cannot read?"". I explained its not on it. She said she didn't know and I should go outside to the Turkish airlines desk and ask. I did - they were too busy socializing with each other and brushed me off saying they don't know. I angrily told them I almost missed my earlier flight because of not knowing my gate.

So our 6:15 departure is now 12:15 then 1:00 then 1:40. We did not pay extra to upgrade our seats so it seems that they will split up seats bought together so you cannot sit next to your spouse apparently that is extra? When our plane arrived we asked if we could change our seat assignment and were told no. Upon boarding we found the plane was half full and those of us who did not pay their extra fees sat in the back rows all split up from our spouses. I realize this is a business and I chose to fly no frills. However, when the company is at fault and they could accommodate a seat change on a delayed flight and place people toward the front to catch their connections why would they not do so? We missed 2 connecting flights because of their poor planning. We have not flown American in years and maybe that was the problem. We will not fly them again.

Southwest Airlines,,Luke Bailey,1st July 2014,"Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay.

Air Canada,1.0,L Walsh,20th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I understand that there can be delays. Air Canada is incompetent in effectively handling delays in particular for business travelers. There are a lot of negative reviews of Air Canada for everything from overall friendliness to food. I care about those things â€“ but as a business traveler I care most about getting to my destination on time, and that delays are handled effectively and knowledgeably when there are disruptions so that I can still get to my destination as needed. I was flying from Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto. My flight was delayed to Toronto, causing me to miss my flight to Shanghai. There were two other flights that could have gotten me to Shanghai in time for my meeting. Due to the incompetence of the Air Canada staff I missed both. In particular, there is no Business Class line at the re-ticketing counter. I waited for an hour and a half â€“ missing both other flight options. I was behind domestic travelers with multiple rerouting options and coach fares. Even when I called over a â€œsupervisorâ€ and explained the situation I was told there was nothing she could do, she couldnâ€™t get me to the front of the line, and I would just have to wait my turn. I was going for a board meeting, with my executive team flying in from all over the world for this meeting. All other travel and arrangements â€“ for all of the other people â€“ needed to be rearranged due to my travel issues. I am a frequent Air Canada traveler. I go to Asia at a minimum twice a year in Business Class. I fly every other week on an expensive (typically $500) ticket to my other office domestically. When I called ""Customer Service"" they were rude, told me there was no management escalation (no way I could talk to a supervisor), and showed absolutely no flexibility. My experience with customer service just added insult to injury. I am taking the time to write this review on as many review sites as I can. I donâ€™t typically write reviews. In this case, however, I really want to warn other business travelers â€“ in particular overseas business travelers â€“ that they are not at all equipped to handle the inevitable travel disruptions and prioritize business class tickets. And thatâ€™s in addition to the relatively uncomfortable business class seats, poor customer service, and bad food.",,Business,Business Class,Pittsburgh to Shanghai via Toronto,March 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Before heading to the airport I received notice that our flight was a couple hours delayed so they offered to switch our flight. We got new flight info to leave an hour or so after our original flight, and got to the airport to hear our new flight was delayed. We were concerned about missing our connection so we called into customer service, they looked up our info and told us it would be no problem we had plenty of time. Landed in San Francisco for our connection realized how close we were going to be, so we called in again to let them know we were on the plane waiting to get off - so they called the desk to inform them we were coming. They told us they would not hold our connecting flight that we were going to just miss it. At the same time the pilot came on to the intercom to let the other passengers know the connecting flight to Hawaii was being held so they would make it. So you hold some flights but not others. We got off the plane and went to customer service to get a different flight and experienced two of the rudest customer service agents I have encountered - showed zero empathy and were told they wouldn't do anything for us, it was not their fault flights get delayed and that is something that has to be handled through the phone. What is the point of even having customer service at the airport if all they do is tell you to call someone else. So we called in and were told all they could do was submit a form and someone would email me - it has been five days still no email. The agent on the phone informed me that she would give us a seat with more leg room, but the only people that could do it was the customer service at the airport that had already told me they had no ability to help - so went back to the counter and the lady and her manager I spoke to earlier walked away from counter, so they didn't have to speak with me. I explained what happened again and the customer service already told me they had the ability to do it and I was still on the phone if they wanted to talk to them about it. After a deep sigh they moved us up a couple rows so we had more leg room - seriously we had to go through all that for more leg room.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,D Cassius,1st April 2015,Rio to AMS in EcoComfort. KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM.

This felt like we were driving back to CPH. Baggage was already there before us. Dubai to Melbourne left on time, which is rare with heavy traffic out of DXB during morning rush time.

Lufthansa,10.0,M Tushishvili,11th March 2014,The flight from Paris to Tbilisi via Munich. Both flights were just excellent. Very efficient check-in and boarding in Paris. Both aircraft's were very clean with informative updates from the pilot. Seats are actually very comfortable in comparison with low cost airlines. Paris-Tbilisi route offers excellent hot food (I had very tasty chicken) as well as the full bar service. One important fact which is important to highlight. I had short connection (45 minutes) in Munich and the plane departed half hour late from Paris. I thought that I would miss the plane to Tbilisi and the big surprise was that the ground staff was waiting for me and transferred from the plane to plane.

American Airlines,2.0,A Forrest,17th March 2014,"Manchester-JFK. Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching. This was my first time with American airlines and I can honestly say its the most prehistoric long haul flight I've ever had the misfortune to get on.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no

Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste.

Half of the connecting flights were Air Canada and half with Jet Airways, an Indian carrier. As always, cabin service is better on Asian airlines. But Air Canada has newer aircraft and outstanding flight deck crews who fear no weather. So I was looking forward to a homeward leg from Dubai to Toronto on AC057, which is serviced by new Boeing 787. What a disappointment! I am 6 ft tall and weight about 200 lbs. The lady on my left side was a small, wider person. We could not fit our shoulders across the seat back space provided, so it was a very uncomfortable 14 hours on this non-stop leg.

We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus.

During landing I experienced the same disorganization and lack of enforcement of rules. When were on final approach to Moscow a woman entered the bathroom and would not leave.

I have never had a problem with Southwest Airlines prior to this trip. On the way down from Boston, the plan was switched twice due to mechanical issues. Needless to say we were stuck in Logan for an additional four hours. They thought that a $100 per voucher per ticket would be okay. Absolutely wrong. We missed our connecting flight and had issues with our car rental because we were late. On our return flight, we had felt with a rude desk staff at gate 121/122. I had asked if we could use the family boarding due to the fact that one of my brothers had a fear of flying and the other, it was his second time flying. They are 17 and 13. She said nope, he's not 6 and I am not allowing it, the standards are enforced here. I told her the southwest personnel in Boston and in Baltimore understood our situation and allowed us to board with families. She said she was not allowing it what so ever. I asked for a manager she said no one was around. I then proceeded to ask for the customer care line to where she gave me a card with minimal information on it. I had to ask a second time for the number.

All the staff were friendly except for a grumpy check-in clerk at Louisville. My check-in bag was 54.5 lbs so was asked to remove an item. I pulled out one slipper and that dropped the weight down to 54 lbs and that was acceptable according to the clerk. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno.

United Airlines,1.0,D Hoang,31st December 2015,"United Airlines is the absolute worst airline and their staff at SFO mirrors how they operate as a company. I booked my flight to cancun a few weeks ago and was flying out yesterday morning. Upon arrival, the plane was overbooked with 120 passengers and only 100 seats. I was of course the odd person out. I was rebooked this morning for a flight out, same time and same flight number. Woke up at 4:30am to take the train to SFO and arrived to find out the flight was cancelled. At this point, I am finished with United Airlines and done with this horrific mess of a situation. I talked to an agent to cancel my roundtrip flight and tried to search for my checked bag (which I checked for my original flight yesterday). Turns out that despite promising me that my bag would not leave to Cancun without its passenger, it ended up going yesterday morning on the overbooked flight. Now I sit here, with my holiday travel plans destroyed and a lost bag. I have to go back to SFO for a 3rd time tomorrow or Friday to pick it up.

Air Canada,2.0,J Howie,31st October 2014,Air Canada have either revamped or replaced their 777s and they are now 3x4x3. I was stuck with a large woman next to me a seat leg directly in front of where my feet needed to go and the leg had an entertainment control box on either side of it in effect requiring me to have no legs as there was nowhere to put my feet. If I had been a 6 foot+ man I would have been miserable. The new leather seats are harder than the old ones and are very uncomfortable. The screen can no longer be angled. The service was the one thing which has not changed it was as dreadful as it has always been. We will after 25 years of flying with AC be looking for a new carrier.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,6.0,J Choo,29th November 2015,"New York to Singapore via Amsterdam with KLM.The flight from Singapore to Amsterdam on 6th November 2015 was delayed for about 2 hours due to the incoming flight from Bali having been delayed by volcanic activity in Bali. The cockpit crew did a good job and managed to make up for some time and arrived in Amsterdam slightly earlier which gave me an hour to transfer to a JFK bound Delta flight instead of 30mins. The cabin crew was pleasant and efficient. There was some light snacks available in the galley although the food portions for the 2 meal service seem a little light. I did see quite a few hungry passengers approaching the cabin crew for food about 8-10 hours into the flight. The meals were satisfying and had a decent variety of items. I took the exit row seat (50K) against the wall (no windows). The seats seem cramped. Whenever the gentlemen next to me unfold his arms, his arms would come into my seat area and rest over my arms. This is not a case of his arms resting on the shared arm rest but a case of the arms coming past the armrest into my seat area. I put it down to the seats being placed too close next to each other which made for a very uncomfortable 13-14 hours flight. I'm 5'6"" and not overweight so I don't think I was too large for my seat. The gentlemen was tall, large but not obese in anyway.

Needed very quick tickets to attend a funeral in the USâ€¦and Qatar was one of the few that had seats and an almost reasonable price. That said pretty impressed with the airline. Seats had good legroom - one minor issue was the lack of adequate padding - my whole family grumbled about it considering the many hours we were on their flights. We were all a little saddle-sore at the end of the long flights - and we were using the blankets as extra padding. Aircraft's were of course newish 777's with the exception of an A340 out of LHRâ€¦IFE was greatâ€¦ wide variety - razor-sharp seat-back screens - we particularly liked their selection of international movies. I'm diabetic and the meals they supplied were fine the rest of the family very happy with their meals as well. No complaints good tucker. Cabin crews varied from outstanding to good. On our last leg back to Perth staff did their job well - if not particularly happily. I did notice they didn't run up and down the aisles with drinks every hour - but given half (or more) of the cabin was usually asleep - I can see why. They were very quick to hand over juice or water whenever requested. Doha terminal is a definite let-down - the bus trips to and from the terminal are dreadful in this day and age.

Our flight from Queenstown to Sydney was on the A320. It departed 15 minutes early and arrived in Sydney 25 minutes early. The seats were more comfortable on this aircraft, in my opinion.

Even if you haven't paid for entertainment you can simply swipe your credit card under the TV screen and for $10NZD have unlimited entertainment for the flight.

Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience.

United Airlines,2.0,B Nuss,5th January 2015,The first leg of our flight was substantially delayed so when we landed in Houston there was no time to eat. Had we known that the next leg was also going to be delayed we would have just delayed boarding and grabbed something. From Houston to Aruba the flight attendants were unfriendly and cranky. They began to offer food for purchase only to find that there was only enough food for the first 1/3 of the plane. On this long flight they only came through the cabin once for beverages. A week later found us at the United counter because one member of our group of three had mysteriously been dropped from the reservation. It took over an hour to get United to see the error. Then of course the flight from Aruba to Houston was delayed but at least we didn't have to wait on the plane this time. Flight attendants were at least cordial and offered beverage service twice. They offered food as well but we had learned our lesson and ate in Aruba! Late getting into Houston so had to run (again) to catch our next plane for our final destination.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Y Johnson,16th August 2018,"Not Verified | My recent flight from JFK New York to Sacramento via Atlanta was 24 hours from hell. Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it. Can't recommend this airline after receiving my belongings in such a state. Basically I received poor customer service, 12 hours added to my travel and over $300 worth of damage/lost items.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York City to Sacramento via Atlanta,August 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,5.0,James Johnson,6th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston.

Air Canada,3.0,T Eldem,31st July 2014,AC 811 from IST to YYZ on B767-300. The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,10.0,Mike Bowen,23rd June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Quick weekend break to Madrid and a wonderful experience of KLM. The price was outstanding via a travel website. Ground staff, in Newcastle, Amsterdam and Madrid were friendly, proactive and efficient. Onboard, cabin staff were possibly the most friendly I've encountered. They couldn't do enough and never seemed harassed. The seats were more than adequate for 2-3 hours. On the shorter Newcastle sectors we were served a small cake and a drink, and the longer hop to Madrid a hot pizza. Bags were rapidly delivered. They were trialling the new AirFi system on the Madrid route - it wasn't internet access, but streaming entertainment, games and news loaded on which you could access with your wifi device - a great idea. Amsterdam was easy to navigate (much more than CDG or LHR). The transit into/out of the Schengen area without any queuing. Schiphol itself is a lovely airport (but I can't understand why literally every shop/bar/eatery closes at 2100)!",Boeing 737-700 / 800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,NCL to MAD via AMS,June 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Air Canada,4.0,K Chen,9th February 2016,"At Toronto airport, even though I had Elite status, the staff didn't make me feel especially welcome or valued customer. I had the opportunity to try out Air Canada's new Premium Economy product on this domestic flight between YYZ and YVR, which required paying a bit extra to be in a special cabin just in front of regular Economy. The seat was not remarkable, except that it has a wider seat pitch and a bit more recline and a footrest. The plane was a Boeing 777, which had 458 seats, and it took a very long time to board the aircraft because there were so many passengers. The crew were doing their job, not particularly friendly or offering service that deserves any mention. On flight was offered drinks twice. The captain (or co-pilot) was attentive though, as we experienced quite a bit of turbulence and he came on several times to assure the passengers.

The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock.

The gate agent [Gate B7 at SLC] got me a reservation on the first flight out the following day as the flight from Houston to New Orleans was the last of the day. The agents kept us up to date and were optimistic that time would be made up and the outbound flight held a few minutes to accommodate enroute passengers. Apparently, meals for first class were not delivered on the previous flight and the gate agent ran down to buy 8 meals to make sure we got fed. The United staff did an excellent job in hurrying boarding and making sure those with tight connections had a good shot at making the next flight. It all worked out! I made the flight to New Orleans.

United Airlines,1.0,Sandra Klein,16th June 2015,"We have flown on United almost exclusively for the past few years, a half dozen times per year. This last trip was the last straw. On the way there, at DCA, there were two agents for about 150 people waiting to go on various flights. It took us a good 45 minutes to get through ticketing and baggage. We missed a connection because the crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before, so we were forced to take one at 8am, which meant waking at 4.30 am. We arrived at the airport, boarded, and were taken off the plane as it did not pass inspection. The flight was then cancelled and the next one was at 8pm, arriving home at midnight. We went to the customer service desk with all 300 other passengers but decided to go to another customer service desk. The agent was nasty and sarcastic to those in front of us, and to us.

United Airlines,3.0,R Broadhead,3rd August 2014,LHR-ORD-LHR. Initial impressions of United were not great as I attempted to check in online only to find that their website system 'could not check you in at this time' after going through the whole process! United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient.

American Airlines,3.0,A Decaro,19th October 2015,"Bradley to Kansas City via Philadelphia. More than a little disappointed with American Airlines. First problem was the sitting arrangement upon ordering tickets online, we were forced to pay a higher fee for premium economy because we did not choose seating the day of original purchase - traveling with a 3 yr old and none of the open seats were next to each other, therefore we were hopeful that we could speak with someone prior to selecting seats to ensure my husband or I were seated next to our child, which we did get but had to pay the extra fee for the premium economy to ensure this. Where the tray table was broken and literally flopped down entirely into my lap and the seat was loose and sliding around under my rear. During our flight from BDL to Philly, our daughter (3 yrs old) had to use the restroom, my husband went to take her and was told by the flight attendant that they had to immediately return to their seats as we were descending and could no longer be up and about - those who have young children should understand, you cannot just tell a 3 yr old child to ""hold it"". What was further infuriating about this scenerio was that we were actually 30 minutes from descending and other passengers were continuing to be up and about to and from the restroom for another 15 minutes after this happened, yet my child was not allowed to go! I have no issues with the safety and rules of an airline but if you are going to tell one person to return to their seat then shouldn't this apply to all passengers?!? Our connecting flight from Philly to MCI wasn't any better, 45 minutes sitting on the tarmac due to delays made our 3 hour and 4 minute flight even longer. The flight attentants were rude and very short when addressed. Are they aware that they entered a public service occupation? After this entire experience, I would definately not recommend this airline for anyone.

The flight was fine but we paid a lot of money and still had to pay more for baggage and to go on an earlier flight. We also paid to get premium economy so as to have a bit of leg room. The airline check-in was a nightmare. We were coming in from overseas on a different airline and had to re-check bags and get seats. There were kiosks, which I assumed were for checking in bags only. We wanted to try to get an earlier flight so I started to approach the â€œadditional servicesâ€ counter. However, the attendants started yelling that the counter was only for missed flights. The whole time we were there, the people at the counter were yelling at everyone to use the kiosk. There was no-one there welcoming us and answering questions, they assumed that we should know their process and yelled when we didnâ€™t. After being in the UK and experiencing the polite service there, it was disappointing that one of our major airlines is so rude to customers.

So, they made me to stay at airport for 12 hours, without any accommodation. They technically treated me like a baggage. The day after this experience, I decided to contact AA to fill a complain and ask them for refund or something.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8.0,B Li,4th June 2014,First-time with Aeroflot. Stuttgart/STR to St. Petersburg/LED via Moscow-Sheremetyevo/SVO. Both on-time. From STR to SVO the plane was an A320 and from SVO to LED the plane was A321. The seats were very comfortable and the leg room was impressive! I am 178cm/5'10 and after sat down there was about 15cm/6in in front of my knees. In fact you can put one leg on the other without any problems. I often fly Lufthansa from Germany to Russia and in Lufthansa's A320/321 economy cabin you definitely do not see this much leg space. The food was fine. STR-SVO includes a full lunch and two rounds of drink service and SVO-LED includes a teriyaki chicken sandwich and drinks. The staffs were professional and spoke adequate amount of English.

Lufthansa,7.0,Arthur Jackson,2nd March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Birmingham to Bangkok via Frankfurt. Contract lounge that Lufthansa uses is the worst at Birmingham by a mile. It was too full when we visited with few spare seats and all the hot food options had run out. Flight to Frankfurt reasonable but it really is just economy class with the middle seat missing. Thereâ€™s nothing business class about this part of the journey. Transfer at Frankfurt pleasantly easy but boarding for the BKK flight quite chaotic. The flight itself was full but fantastic. We were served by the same Bangkok based crew member throughout, she was really friendly and professional, 10/10. Food was great, all choices available. I found the seats really comfortable and managed over 6 hours of good sleep.

Thank God there was a seat empty so that the other passenger could sit during the flight. My flight was delayed for almost an hour. And then, another poor service from KLM airport crew was that I had to put my hand luggage in the luggage compartment of the aircraft. I was told that I could pick it in Amsterdam Schipol Airport. But it was so complicated and took three to four hours for me to get that. So I gave up, and they said that it would be safely send with the other luggage (the 23kg suitcase) to my final destination. In Jakarta, after two hours waiting, my hand luggage didn't show up. So I filed a report, and after three days it was sent to the airport but in a very poor condition. The handle and lock are severely broken. Today is the 21st day after my arrival and I have received only one e-mail that asked me to give the luggage details, which I replied as soon as I could. But until now, not even a single mail or call have I received. KLM should be able to handle baggage properly and not disappoint passenger like this.

Qatar Airways,5.0,Eu Jin Song,26th May 2014,As a frequent flier who travels on business on average of once a month I was rather disappointed to note the poor quality of the cabin crew on both legs of my recent Business Class flight onboard Qatar Airways. The crew were indifferent cold and impersonal. There was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew (with the exception of the inflight supervisor) unwilling to engage in conversation. I mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the Captain had the seatbelt sign on. Dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. The plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour!! Too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. Food was good but not fantastic. The inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. The seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. Happy to note that Qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued. Overall my disappointment with the cabin service overwhelms what positives I obtained from a good lounge in Doha and efficient check in service.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Flight out slightly older 777 seat not that comfortable and screen too small. Flight attendants the best I have met slightly more mature ladies with children so they really know how to help you out with a baby. They took it turns to carry my daughter around the cabin and went out their way to be helpful with food. Schipol airport is the best airport I have ever been to for small children. Dedicated lounge staff changing facilities cots for babies playgrounds all free. Food at Schipol great value and quality. Manchester is awful no help with luggage. no baby facilities welcome to blighty (not). Second flight to Manchester efficient and well run. Flight home was on a very windy day flight had a go around at Schipol. Schipol again fantastic for the little one. We had 90kg of luggage (even a baby bath) and KLM took care of everything for a small fee. Flight home to BKK again outstanding cabin staff (no dumb pretty trolly dollies) 777 though needs a refit.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Vivian Woo,31st December 2015,"Singapore to London via Doha was fine except my in-flight entertainment screen seemed to have a mind of its own. The shows that I were watching kept skipping back and forth and stopped as it pleased on its own accord when I was not even touching the screen or the remote control which was annoying. The meals were okay, some of the side dishes had tastes I was not accustomed to. On my trip home from London to Singapore via Doha, the plane from London arrived at Doha late by about half an hour. Because the transit time was only 45 minutes, we missed the connecting flight back to Singapore and the way they handled this could have been improved. Before we started running to the connecting gate, someone could have informed us that there was no point doing so and bring us to the customer service for alternative flights. When a large group of us approached the customer service, some staff seemed flustered and annoyed instead of calming down the passengers politely. When we asked for an alternative flight, they gave us one which leaves Doha 12 hours later.

Attendant stated before take off, when you could not hear the muffled slurred comment something about downloading the United app to get TV or movies. She never said clearly and specifically the we needed to do so prior to take off. Once in the air, no way to see movies or TV on an almost 5 hours flight. Why should I have to download a United app, what if I had not had electronic items with me? Paid the same for a far different experience. On the other plane they handed out a portable tablet to watch entertainment. Come on United, get current. Food offerings were both full of dough, either ravioli or a calzone.

Emirates,2.0,G Moore,22nd September 2014,I have flow with Emirates 6 times now and there are some very good good and poor aspects to the overall experience. In particular I refer to our Istanbul to Dubai flight on 7 Aug 2014. There was the normal long delay in check-in due in perceive (after working 30 years in aviation) large quantity of check in baggage that Emirates passengers have - some would see as a plus - combined with minimal experience staff. But the carry on baggage was the big issue both in regard to safety and comfort! Some people were bringing 35kg on board. Bags that just fitted into the lockers and a passenger opposite us had three of them. The onboard staff just helped them put more into the lockers without regard to the effect on others of the 100 passengers I could observe we were the only ones under the 7kg stated limit. When a senior crew from business class started stuffing our soft bags into a smaller space so they could get others large bags away and close the doors I was pointedly told what I could do with my concerns. He did not dispute that others had 35kg of carry on bags! In addition we had 2 obese passengers next to us. The crew provided them with extension seat belts but this doesn't stop them squashing those adjacent. Again the crew were unhelpful. I spent most of the flight walking around the aircraft. Finally the food on this flight was well below the standard I have known on other Emirates flights.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,no

American Airlines,4.0,J Johnson,17th January 2014,Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future. Also in flight entertainment was broken on our of our flights.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,no

The female employee who was checking boarding passes at Buffalo was extremely rude. She got flustered when I pointed out that she had not given my niece's passport back to her and she stated, ""I thought you were all together! Next time you need to get here earlier. I almost unseated all of you!"" To which I replied that we had looked up what time to be there on United's website and it stated to be there an hour and a half before your flight, which we were. There was no entertainment available unless you brought your own hand held device. If you had your own hand held device, but didn't have earbuds or headphones, they didn't have any for you. It took my son six hours to watch a two hour movie because the WiFi kept shutting down. They charged us for the meals on a 9 hr flight - charged us for the Italian sandwich, which is what we ordered, but they gave us the turkey sandwich which was cheaper. If the food has improved (as I've seen from some reviews), I would have hated to eat it before. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. We tried to upgrade and were told we couldn't. We were traveling with six people all together. They ruined 3 of the suitcases, one of them brand new. The steward staff on the return flight from Maui were very nice, polite, and professional, but it did not make up for all that we had already experienced.

The good things: Superb food better than C on QF oodles of room in the seats great cabin crew on all sectors priority boarding. However seats are uncomfortable. I appreciate the unique design but you just can't get into a good position. They are leather but in my opinion the padding is far too thin and the only way to sleep is to put the seat at full tilt pile up the bean bag with a cushion and lay out straight. Seeing the space the seats take up I'm not surprised ANZ are not going to continue them into new aircraft - they must lose money on them even at a premium fare. The design is also clunky in that nothing works smoothly - you need to force up the armrests and the seat belt is a pain. It has an airbag but it rests uncomfortably on your side. A great idea in theory - but not so good in practice.,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

Rude, aggressive and miserable staff. Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick â€“ Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldnâ€™t tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldnâ€™t go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting.

Firstly, you cannot do online check-in as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves. We departed slightly late but landed almost 20 minutes early which was the cherry on top.",A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Montreal,October 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes

My wife and I have been up for over 24 hours and still have another 25 before returning home. The only kind person was the morning ticketing agent who at least gave us a food voucher.

United Airlines,3.0,R Foulkes,5th October 2014,First class sure isn't what it used to be. On a round trip from Dulles to Vegas both times they ran out of cereal before they took my breakfast order so all they had to offer were some nasty eggs broccoli casserole and dried out croissants. Apparently they only stock enough cereal for 1/2 of first class? Really? For a $1378 ticket I want my freaking cereal not food poisoning. The clincher was that they charge first class passengers for wi-fi access. They should be ashamed. Only a half notch above economy if that much.,,,First Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,J McVittie,6th October 2015,"I will avoid United Airlines in the future. Two long delays on two segments of a two segment trip. Also, United has poor legroom in economy (I've actually had more comfortable seats in Southwest). Everything is an ""upgrade"" even when there are open seats on the plane. United also discourages checked baggage with $25 fee for first bag and a whopping $40 for second. As a result overhead bins are almost always full requiring you to check carry on at the gate. Because of all the carry on bags, boarding and deplaning is very slow. Airlines pay for time at the gate. The faster they can get people on and off the plane the less it costs them. Every airline should offer 2 free checked bags and allow only one personal item carry on.

I liked that the flight attendants didn't walk up down the aisle with carts - it allows them to get through so much faster and doesn't trap people in the aisle when they're trying to go to the restroom.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,A Kleissner,6th July 2014,We flew from Gatwick to Istanbul (return) and Istanbul - Izmir (return). Planes varied - the least good was a workaday Airbus between Istanbul and Izmir (nothing wrong with it though) the best a brand new B737-800 to Gatwick. We flew economy but noted that business class on the latter had excellent seats. All flights flew to time. Food was very good (complete with metal cutlery). Even between Istanbul and Izmir we got an hors d'oeuvre plus a good sandwich and some cake - the crew hardly had time to serve it. All staff polite and helpful.

To say that the airport resembled a construction site would be a understatement. TK has a few check-in counters operational for limited international operations. Self check-in kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge, just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for B/C and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew.

It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,Rosemary Westgarth,21st July 2015,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with.

Jetblue Airways,2.0,Sara Castellan,15th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. I am very disappointed in my recent flying experience with Jet Blue. My boyfriend and I were traveling to Cancun for a getaway, on the way there we had a connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale with a layover time of 43 minutes. We were delayed as the plane needed to be deiced prior to takeoff, which set us back 25 minutes. Our flight was a smooth flight, landing in fort Lauderdale 22 minutes prior to us needing to get on our connecting. However, due to us arriving a bit later than scheduled time we had no gate to run into therefore waited on the runway for 20 minutes, causing us to miss our connecting. We were informed by the pilot that he got confirmation from the pilot that they would hold the doors. The crew allowed us to get off the plane first and race (and mean race) to our gate. Jetblue closed the doors 1 minute prior to us getting to our gate. We ran to the desk however the gentlemen informed us we were too late the doors have already been closed. I informed him the pilot was aware we were minutes late however he said thatâ€™s too bad once the doors are closed they are closed. The customer service received at the help desk was ridiculous. The attendant advised us there was nothing they could do other than put us on the next flight which was scheduled for the next day. I told them that was in 24 hours from now and they said we could sleep in the airport. We requested to speak to a manager as we were receiving little help or support. 1 hour later no manager arrived. I phoned JetBlue and advised them of our situation and in turn they offered us a free stay at a nearby hotel. Better than sleeping on a stiff airport chair. I am writing this review so customers/future customers flying with JetBlue can see the hassle my boyfriend and I went through. I am thankful we received a night however if a gate would have been opened we never would have had to spend 3 hours at the airport trying to make alternative arrangements and would have enjoyed the day/night paid for at the all inclusive resort. Not a good way to spend your anniversary! I would also like to add - if you are connecting to another flight using the same airline and you are Within minutes of reaching your gate, the pilots should communicate with each other.

I flew from Thunder Bay to Toronto in the most uncomfortable seats imaginable in the back row while the plane was full with Air Canada staff flying in their aisle seats. In Toronto apparently paying for your seat is not enough. I did not have a pre-booked seat so that meant I was a second class citizen due no courtesy or respect from the Air Canada ticket attendant who didn't even want to speak to me until everyone else was on the plane.

The seats are so cramped in Economy Class that it is hard to stretch yourself. They give you warm napkins only on the onward flight and not on return flights. I was carrying my suits so I asked the flight attendant if he could hang my suit in the wardrobe for me and his body language was so obvious that he did not want to oblige my request! Only when I argued with him did he agree to hang my suits. Flight attendants are generally unfriendly they hardly smile and it seems that they are doing the passengers a favor! They generally make a big thing even when your baggage is overweight by 2 or 3 kgs they only allow 23 kgs per passenger in Economy. Compare this to Emirates where you get a generous Baggage allowance of 30 kgs per person on Economy.

Air Canada,6.0,T Eldem,16th September 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Brussels to Montreal on Air Canada. Our trip originated in Prague with the first leg operated by Brussels Airlines so upon landing in Brussels we proceeded to the lounge. AC uses Brussels Airlines lounge which was very crowded and had very limited food and drink options. We proceeded to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and were met with a long queue for passport verification. When I went up to the counter to inquire if there were a separate line for business class passengers the agent simply responded by saying there was only one line and pointed to the back of it. We had somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 passengers ahead of us and there were only two ground agents performing the checks. After 20 minutes in the line I went up again and asked why they did not have a dedicated line for premium passengers like they do at every other European airport. In a rather sarcastic tone the agent simply said â€œthis is how we do it in Brusselsâ€. We finally got through the line at which time I spotted the AC Concierge and immediately questioned him about the process only to be told that they do have a dedicated line for premium passengers. At this point I was getting quite agitated and asked him why it was not in effect that day. To that he simply said he did not know. We then went into the priority boarding line which was a joke as there had to be 100 people in the line. Finally the agents announced start of boarding but instead called for those in zones 3 and 4 ahead of the priority passengers. At this point the boarding became a free for all and resembled those you would see in third world airports. On board the service was great but the hard product was showing its age. Food was quite tasty but they had no red wine as they simply had not loaded enough on the inbound trip from Montreal. IFE has a reasonable selection and before landing we were served another meal which was also very tasty. Aside from the utterly chaotic gate experience it was a decent experience.,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Brussels to Montreal,September 2018,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,yes
Lufthansa,2.0,D Watkins,15th July 2014,Flight from Perth to Frankfurt via Singapore. Pleasantly surprised that the Lufthansa A380 flight was more pleasant (happy crew) and comfortable than the code-share Singapore airline flight Perth to Singapore. However the return flight from Toulouse to Perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into Frankfurt. The almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at Frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re- book (almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot) was a disgrace. It is the fear of this recurring which means I will be highly unlikely to fly with Lufthansa again.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Kristen Gold,24th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Me and 2 friends were flying to Yellowstone for a vacation. First of all, there shouldn't be a 35 minute layover in the Houston airport as an option. My bag had to be courtesy checked in Charleston, so when I landed in Houston, I had to wait 10 minutes for my bag. We ended up having 10 minutes until the gate closed for our next flight. We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn't let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn't they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says ""You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?"" Are you kidding me? She wouldn't comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren't liable. She couldn't get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip. Our travel experience was awful, and if United would at least compensate for some of that ridiculous amount of extra money we spent, I would be way happier right now.

Virgin America,3.0,J Harris,10th December 2014,I purchased an Economy Select Aisle seat I boarded the plan situated myself in the seat and within a few minutes was asked by a Virgin employee to see my boarding pass. They indicated another passenger had the same seat assignment who had the same last name as me. It turns out that this other person bought a different seat and at the gate an employee made an error and changed his seat to mine thinking he was me. Virgin didn't handle the situation well and out of respect for getting the plane boarded and on it's way I gave up my seat that I paid extra for and took and inferior seat. Virgin didn't offer to boat me for what I didn't end up getting and I don't have time to call them and complain. I'm certain they wouldn't reimburse me anyway. As far as flight operations our flight was Lax to Boston it took off 2 hours late because the invoking flight was late they kept the flight listed as on time even though they knew it was late hours before. Loading the plane took much longer than JetBlue or Southwest and I found the head seat entertainment system difficult to use. I will never fly them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,2.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,J Oben,12th December 2013,Thursday evening they cancelled my son's flight to DFW (due to weather) I held on the phone for 1.5 hours and even though he was flying as an unaccompanied minor and they could see I was on another flight to a foreign country at the time they wanted me to pick him up and take him back to the airport later. My friends husband came to the airport to take my son so he could then take him to his new 2pm flight. I waited in line at the airport I was flying out from for a gate agent to fill out the paperwork pay the extra fee etc. but no one was even at work at the gate. I have to fill out paperwork for my son pay and still get to my own flight and through security. My son was put on a flight for that afternoon then makes it to Dallas. Today I come back to the country and when attempting to board my flight from MIA to DFW I am told I can't take my bag on that has already been on 4 American Flights since Friday. They called final boarding. She proceeded to tell me now I wouldn't be getting on that flight. The supervisor eventually put me on a standby flight for 6.50 am since I missed the 8.35 pm flight I was supposed to be on the night before. They told me I was welcome to sleep in the terminal.

Whilst I was glad of the upgrade and the ability to lie flat on what was a comfortable bed I was very disappointed with some of the soft product on board. The catering was fairly dire with a hamburger being the best option available for the evening meal. When did Air New Zealand start outsourcing its catering function to a strip-mall burger joint. Cheeses to follow were inedible and while the wine was nice, it certainly was not free flowing. Felt a little bit of a cheap experience overall. The overall cost of the meal, including what passed as a starter, cannot have been more than $10. When the airfare is around 3-4k one way on this leg, I would expect more Crew on the flight were good (as is the norm on Air NZ) just being let down by having to serve a substandard product.

I understand the issue with air traffic control, however FAA stated computers were back in service at 4 pm on 8/15. Southwest only had three to four flights to IAD and my flight was at 8:55 pm. So with only four flights, Southwest could not get the later flights to IAD out? I'm stuck in an airport on standby but the only thing Southwest say is sorry, it wasn't our fault. Southwest needs to do a better job with its flights and with IAD being a major airport, more flights to and from are needed.

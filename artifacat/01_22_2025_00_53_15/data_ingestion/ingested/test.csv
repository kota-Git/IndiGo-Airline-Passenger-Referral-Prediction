Qatar Airways,7.0,S Chim,25th September 2013,SIN-DOH-BRU and TXL-DOH-SIN. Food onboard was acceptable. Seats were fairly comfortable. Inflight service ranged from average to outstanding depending on the flight attendant. Inflight entertainment was very good. The problem was the transit at Doha it was nothing short of a disaster. The buses that take you to and from the terminal were excruciatingly slow and extremely packed. Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere. After having our boarding pass scanned for the transfer flight we took an escalator down to the waiting area in the bus bay. We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told. When the bus got to the plane surprise surprise the doors stayed closed and we stayed inside the packed bus for another 15 minutes. Only on the plane did the captain explain that the aircraft came in late resulting in the delay. I wouldn't want to do another transit in Doha again at least not until their new airport is completed.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

American Airlines,2.0,P Merton,25th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | It all started when Ticketing agent in San Jose could not complete a family checkin for over an hour. Caused us to miss our 8am plane to DFW even though we were at airport 2 hours before departure. Waited for the next plane scheduled to leave at 1:37pm. But they hadnâ€™t handled our ticket change correctly and we werenâ€™t even booked on the flight. Another agent got us on as the last 3 passengers on board. American had previously announced the crew for the next flight was missing and another crew was busing in from San Francisco. Departed 45 mins late with a tight 1 hour connection in DFW. American assured us that all of the connections would be made. Upon arrival, hurried to change terminals and arrived at gate with 5 mins to spare. No one there even though American agents said they would call ahead and tell them we were coming. Put on next flight scheduled for 10:25 departure to Northwest Arkansas. American announces they donâ€™t have a plane for this flight. They announce that a plane is due at 10:36. Now due to depart at 11:00. Weâ€™ll see! Incompetent ticketing agent! Missing crew!

We had an annoying 75 minute stop in Singapore with a change of crew before the flight to Dubai. The whole demeanour of things changed. The new crew members on the whole seemed rude and abrupt. A young woman travelling on her own was not allowed a bassinet for her young child, whereas she had experienced no problems Brisbane to Singapore. I took up the advocate's role but to no avail.

American Airlines,1.0,Sarah Butler,5th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | We were scheduled to leave Kahului at 8:53 PM to Dallas to connect to a flight to Harrisburg with American Airlines. We sat on the tarmac for 3 hours with only 2 updates the entire time before they cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues. We were never once offered a beverage and the planes air conditioning had to be turned off so it was sweltering in the cabin with every seat occupied. Once we exited the aircraft, it was sheer chaos in attempting to figure out our next move and we were told we were not allowed to leave the airport. After waiting in the airport for another 2 hours with small children, we were finally given a voucher to a cheap hotel. Our family's flights were all completely different when they were finally rescheduled. I had to pay $100 to be able to stay in our room until 6 PM and our new flight did not even leave until midnight. Our new flight was late getting in into Phoenix and then delayed another 2 hours before we could leave for Chicago. When I questioned how we would make our connecting flight in Chicago, the AA staff was rude and snapped ""Well, I guess you won't now, will you?"" We missed our connecting flight and had to wait another 4 hours in Chicago. When I tried to speak with someone in customer service, I was told repeatedly that I had to go to the website and file a complaint. When I did speak to someone that basically told me ""too bad, you're flight already happened"". Our large family travels quite a bit and will never use American Airlines again. We refuse to fly with incompetent, rude and ignorant staff. We were never even offered any vouchers. This airline is a joke and greedy.

There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. After take-off, the cabin crew started the snack/drink service. Everyone got a cheese/beacon sandwich, but I am a vegetarian so I asked them if they had a vegetarian sandwich. They had vegetarian sandwiches and I got 2 drinks with the sandwich. From Athens, I took my next plane towards Amsterdam. This flight was operated by Aegean itself and the plane was an A321. There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. 30 minutes after take-off, the cabin crew started to serve meal and drinks to everyone onboard. Sadly, they didn't had a vegetarian option. But beside the meal itself everything was tasty. After I finished the meal I have slept till our descent towards Amsterdam. We arrived safely at Amsterdam.

Southwest Airlines,2.0,Prathyusha Sunkara,4th November 2015,"This is one among my most disappointing review Iâ€™ve shared. All over the airport was reviewing publicity posters which says â€œTransfarencyâ€ by Southwest Airlines which Iâ€™m arenâ€™t sure how would that define without providing a minimal customer gratification, which not everyone thinks that money might be the only criteria to check. Iâ€™ve been associated with Southwest since long time, but havenâ€™t felt this way where I had to lost valuable time with repeated change/delay in time. Further I was nowhere in a choice but had to wait for hours and hours. At time there were situation with my company where I had backed Southwest for its remarkable service in-spite of contradicting opinions all over. I made all my personal and business trips through this airline but eventually had end up in a situation of bizarre. Expected arrival of journey was 9 p.m and travel home on a emergency, and could't make it because of an undefined delay, In fact I had to drive 9 hrs by road to reach on time, and on return again had faced delay, however I understand weather issues.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Victor Neagu,14th August 2015,"Flew Turkish Airlines in mid-June. I am a loyal TK customer but this experience was a total let down and I have decided to switch to other carriers. The food is normally good, the lounge in Istanbul is excellent, but their service is deteriorating by the day. Old, dirty seats, no priority boarding, no access to lounges in smaller airports, finally they didn't load my special meal. When I complained through their online customer service system they were not apologetic, but on the contrary tried to justify and explain every fault. Moreover, delays of anywhere between 15-45 minutes are a normal occurrence. They don't even bother apologizing to customers. It's almost perceived as something totally acceptable.

Emirates,7.0,F Kleinen Hammans,27th May 2015,AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering. The crew however in my opinion delivered a very inconsistent service along the different flights. In general the welcome during boarding was excellent personal and warm. But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered. It really was an accumulation of mistakes that can happen but the handling of it made me unhappy. All in all I will fly them again for the comfortable product they offer but I have tempered my expectations for the overall face to face contact during the flights which in my opinion weigh heavily.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,L Dayton,17th June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | We booked a vacation via Travelocity in early March for this June. About three weeks later, we get an email saying that our flight has been changed to leave three hours and a half hours earlier, creating a 4 hour layover in Dallas before heading to our real destination of Cozumel. They also changed our return flight to arrive at a completely different airport on the opposite side of the city (about an hour away). This flight also included more layover time. I tried to check in online the night before our flight and checked my bags. I wanted to make sure that we could get in and on the plane quickly and easily. This is the best way to travel through any other airlines I've been on. Not so with American Airlines. It was upon checking in and checking my bags and feeling this great relief that a few minutes later I get the dreaded email - they changed our flight again, just hours before our flight. This time they added another 2 hours layover in Dallas making it a 6 hour layover and it's leaving two hours earlier. We were already booked on a dawn flight. Please keep in mind that flying directly to Cozumel from Houston is only 2 hours total. Since we are flying this airline, we are flying first to a more northern location to wait more than half a day and then back south to our final destination. We arrive at the airport without any sleep because they didn't tell us until 9 pm that they were changing our flight to 5:10 AM. The airport is an hour from our house and this is an international flight, so we had to leave our house by 2 am to get there on time for customs. We actually decided to leave even earlier since we couldn't sleep anyway and got to the airport by 2:30 AM. This is two hours and forty minutes before our flight and there is no one at the ticketing booth. In fact, they had a long line and all the passengers were worried about missing their flights. No one came to the booth until just past 3 am and still took on average 25 minutes for each group of travelers. We didn't get to security until about 50 minutes before our flight and they almost didn't let us on. In fact, one of the security ladies chewed me out because I was feeling antsy and worried about making my flight. She barked that I should have gotten to to the airport well before my flight. I was. It was American Airlines fault for not being at their ticketing booth on time, nor having enough agents to check in their passengers. They are the ones who moved our flight to the middle of the night without our permission, and without any options to change this. It's not our fault they don't have staff to deal with these changes they inflict on their clients. I am actually on the plane and I am going to try to move past how upsetting this whole experience is and that I will waste a full day of my vacation without any sleep and stuck in an airport north of my destination and departing city. The only thing that gives me peace of mind in all of this is that there are other options/airlines in the future because I will never fly with them again after my return flight, which I pray they don't screw up too. We leave tomorrow afternoon for home on this airline. All of this and they charged us baggage fees when I originally checked in online and then charged again when we checked in at the airport because American Airlines had to modify our return flight. They have yet to reimburse for the duplicate charges.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HOU to CZM via DFW,June 2016,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,1.0,U Ahmad,22nd November 2015,"I travelled on Emirates with my wife and 2 month old baby from London to Lahore via Dubai return. Our bassinet seats were changed on all flights apart from Heathrow to Dubai despite having reserved and requested bassinet seats. The staff attitude was terrible as our seats were changed at Dubai and they just would not give me a reason despite asking on a number of occasions to why they have changed our seats, upon checking my reserved seats once boarded only to discover another couple with a child sitting in our reserved seats. On return flight from Dubai to London we were told a number of times we had got my bassinet seats as reserved even up until the point we was boarding. When we boarded the plane we had recieved seats 1 behind the Bassinet seats - so I complained and nothing was done about it. However, a nice passenger in one of the bassinet seats gave his up so my wife could sit there with the baby, he and many others around could not understand why we had been changed and people not needing bassinet seats given them.

Alitalia,1.0,L Taylor,30th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | My boyfriend and I flew Alitalia Miami to Rome and our luggage did not make it to Rome with us. We filed a claim at FCO and were assured our luggage would be delivered to us where we were staying in Venice. We spent our entire time in Venice either trying to contact them or being available for them to contact us to let us know when to expect our luggage. Every person we talked to gave us different information (""the bags should be delivered tonight,"" 2 hours later ""one bag is in Rome but we don't know about the other,"" 2 hours later ""both bags are still in Miami,"" etc.), but all assured us that our bags would be delivered to us. It wasn't until the night before we were supposed to leave Venice that we were informed that we would have to go pick up our luggage ourselves from the Venice airport. Because the lost and found office at the Venice airport doesn't open until 10AM, this meant missing our 9:30AM train to Florence which we'd already bought tickets for, and having to spend 30 euros on roundtrip tickets to the Venice airport plus buying 100 euro replacement train tickets to Florence. Since we've been back home, Alitalia has been just as useless. I was told the office that handles delayed baggage claims has no phone number, and it takes roughly 3 days to get a canned email response from them. Alitalia is refusing to reimburse us for the bus tickets to the Venice airport and the replacement train tickets to Florence we had to buy, because according to them we could have elected to not pick up our bags and just have them shipped to us back home in the states, clearly not a real option.

The exceptionally poor service by the cabin crew made the trip memorable for all the wrong reasons. The whole experience started on a rather odd note, when boarding the flight I was asked if I had a visa for Australia. I thought it was a rather unusual question given that I was traveling on an Australian passport. And when I attempted to explain that I don't need a visa to go home, she continued to argue that I need to present one. And it all went downhill from there. When I finally boarded the plane and I was offered a drink, I politely asked if I could have a glass of water without ice. I was thirsty as I just raced through LAX to make my connecting flight home. And I could not believe my ears when the crew member responded with the question 'What's wrong with you?' Now I know why United has such a poor reputation.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,John Moloney,6th March 2016,"Check in at Gatwick was quick and was advised that flight to Istanbul was on time. By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay. Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat. What was especially good was the standard of catering and the fact the the meal was served so quickly.

I cannot understand why, having disappointed us the first meal, they could not have served us first on the second meal, the kitchen was directly behind us and they had to pass us to start serving from the front again.

The seat was a little dirty but I put this down to it not being the first flight and the tight turnaround, nothing abhorrent. The only downside is the immovable ottoman footrest. If you are under 5â€™7â€ you may struggle to reach it. The inflight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies and tv shows as well as an interactive map showing you the route. It was much more responsive than other IFE systems that I have used recently and the remote is touch screen which helps a lot. The food was respectable for such a short flight, with two choices for the main, either chicken or beef with all the trimmings. Altogether when the salad and desert it was very tasty and the crew kept filling up drinks and offering bread rolls. I was surprised to get a meal on this flight but I was glad I did. The crew themselves were very happy which was pleasant and they were very attentive. The KLM houses were a unique experience as no other airlines do this. I got house number 28 and it is filled with a Dutch Gin. Overall it was a nice flight compared to the competitors on the route and was very well priced for a business product.

I had my business class flight cancelled and resold whilst I was on my connecting flight. I was only informed of this seconds before boarding despite being checked in. I was told I would have to fly the following day as I sat with a leg injury in a wheelchair! I asked if any first class seats were available as I cannot bend my knee. I was told both business and first class were full. This was not the case, after arguing my case with a member of airport staff, I was given a business class seat and it's occupant was bumped up to first class! I cannot believe I was lied to and that given that Emirates had sold my ticket to someone else they did not just offer me the first class seat. Instead leaving me upset and distressed in the airport.

Qatar Airways,9.0,G Gilliam,18th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha. An evening service using Boeing 777 on first leg and Boeing 787 from Doha. Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777. Overall, I have to say that Qatar offer an incredibly good service, with amazing food, great staff, a modern fleet, and very comfortable lounges, particularly in Doha. I would seek them out actively in preference to the other middle eastern airlines, and that is really saying something.",Boeing 777 / 787,Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha,April 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,yes

Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige.

Once upon a time America lead the world with customer service. American Airlines staff seemed to be so demotivated that they really have little interest in their customers.

American Airlines,8.0,D Graubard,10th May 2015,AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4.0,Farouk Mogheth,9th January 2011,Bangkok-Moscow-Prague and return. I tried Aeroflot again and my decision was made on the basis of the facts that they use new A330 on their longhaul which is a big step forward compared to their Il96 Russian aircraft and Aerflot flights and Skyteam partners moved to the newly opened Terminal E and D in Sheremetyovo which is supposed to shelter the passengers from the horrors of what is now called Terminal F. The flight from BKK was okay check in was problem free the boarding process was chaotic as usual and staff completely uninterested to help. To my horror we parked at the older terminal and it was the same story all over again. Horrible terminal with sad staff barking at passengers overcrowded old terminal with people sitting on the ground. I consider it as false advertising and clearly the airline lied as my reservations stated all flights were to fly to/from the new terminal. The A330 new and still clean onboard entertainment limited but okay a small number of films and a very limited music choice. The food was good and portions sufficient only one drink then totally zero cabin presence. After the meal the crew hid for at least 8 hours at the back of the plane and ignored many calls for service. They shamelessly kept hauling business class food for what it seems as their own private party at the back galley. Toilets filthy as no one checks on them. The same thing at the return flight. Beware that Aeroflot Bangkok flights are predominantly family oriented so there will be a large % of infants on board which can get very tricky with a plethora of babies yelling all through the red eye flight in unison. Aeroflot's greatest weakness is in its crew - sad robotic and no eye contact whatsoever.

The plane was redirected to another airport. When I landed in Dallas I called customer support to help me get on a flight. The gentleman I talked to was very nice. He told me about flights I could get on and told me he placed me on ""standby."" I then ran from terminal to terminal to try and get on this flight. When I got to the desk the american airlines desk told me I was not on the list for ""standby."" I called customer service back to ask why I was not put on ""standby"" he told me his computer told him I was on ""standby."" I then missed that flight that had open seats available because the agent did not tell me I was not on ""standby."" I was added as a request to be put on the flight. Which the team outside the plane could not see. The agent at the desk then looked into why I wasnt on ""standby."" He then found he had to remove what customer service placed on my name to allow me to be put on ""standby."" This then put me one name away from getting on the next flight. After not being able to make it on that flight I thought customer service should know about what happened. I talked to a service agent that dismissed everything I told her. I ask to then speak to a supervisor. She did not treat me with respect or listen to what had happened. She only wanted me to know that policy said they did everything right.

As a customer who flights often I assumed the airline would want to know how to better improve there customer service. She did not find this as a priority. The supervisor then was rude and nothing, but negative against the customer. I hope this review can help other individuals who are stressed that their flight is missed.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,Jezrel Sabaduquia,18th December 2014,JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,,,First Class,,,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

Flight staff were very attentive and the service on the 9 hour overnight flight was great. Amazing food great entertainment on a large screen and the seat is great for working and sleeping too. A decent pillow and fleece blanket are provided. THe walk up bar with snacks during the flight was great as were the massive toilets in which you can change into more comfy wear for sleeping pj's are not provided. Bose headphones made for cinema sound and the amenity kit was of a good quality too. Food servings being on an American carrier are generous.

American Airlines,1.0,Lori Edelman,22nd May 2016,"Saint Martin to Philadelphia with American Airlines. I am 27 years old and my mother is 62. In all our years of travel neither of us had ever experienced anything like our flight out of Saint Martin yesterday. We booked a direct flight that left at 2:40PM and was to land in Philadelphia at 7:13PM. When we boarded the plane we were told we would arrive in Philadelphia early and were very pleased by this news. However, after a short time the pilot told us that there was something wrong with the plane. ""Something"" with no further detail as to what was wrong or how long it would take to repair. After 2 hours of waiting in the plane, we were told that the plane was repaired and would be able to fly. The pilot informed us however that due to ""legal issues"" we would not be able to fly to Philadelphia as planned, which was an estimated 4 hours and 35 minutes, instead we would be flying to Miami a 3 hour and 15 minute flight. We were not told anything other than that. We were then given the option to leave the plane but were told we would not be provided a room. About 40 minutes later we took off for Miami. We landed in Miami and waited on the tarmac for over an hour. Were told that we would be greeted by individuals who would tell us where to go and would take us step by step through customs and our return to the 10:30 flight from Miami to PHL. There was no one there to greet us when we arrived and no one to direct us through customs and security. We went through customs and were required to go through TSA security, despite not leaving the airport or having time to purchase anything. Once we arrived at our flight we were delayed in boarding and did not take off until after 11:30. We arrived in Philadelphia at around 2:00 and there was no one from AA to greet us or speak to. We waited, as a group, for our luggage for over 45 minutes before it began to come out. I am extremely disappointed with how disorganized and unapologetic this airline was. If I can avoid using AA in the future I intend to.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SXM to PHL,2016-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no
Aegean Airlines,2.0,N Kalouni,7th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Athens. After scanning my boarding pass the ground staff asked me to weigh my carry-on bag, found that it weighed 10.5 kg : 2.5 kg above the permitted 8 kg per passenger and asked me to pay GBP 70 because they needed to check my bag in as overweight. When I protested and said that I would transfer some items to my children's carry-ons in order to reduce the weight to 8kg, the ground staff threatened to weigh all our carry-ons / hand luggage and shopping to verify that they met the 8 + 3kg limit per person. It is disappointing to experience such behaviour with my national airline which I have been using loyally for over 15 years. If an airline wishes to verify carry-on weights, then they should apply its checks across the board and not pick passengers arbitrarily. I bought almost 4 months in advance a round-trip ticket from Athens to London including a checked in suitcase for EUR 528 including taxes, and ended up paying Aegean EUR 608. A final point I would like to make is that using SAS as ground staff to represent Aegean Airlines at LHR that seriously damage its reputation - irreparably in my case.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Athens,August 2018,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,2.0,no

American Airlines,7.0,Pav Paul,12th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable. Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience.

Air Canada,4.0,T Eldem,10th January 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Munich to Toronto with Air Canada. We were met by the AC Concierge and promptly processed through the check-in formalities. The flight was delayed by a full hour due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft. On board the high density configuration in Economy (3x4x3) on the B777 is simply awful. I had the bulkhead aisle seat and my knee and elbow were bumped several times and my foot stepped on twice. I cannot imagine anyone getting any sleep in that seat during an overnight flight. The configuration makes the aisles so narrow that one has to walk sideways so as not to bump into other passengers. This is a sad reminder that AC puts profits way ahead of passenger comfort. The FA's were all very nice and worked hard throughout the flight. The in flight service director on the other hand was smug and very condescending. Food was OK for Economy but portions were very small. IFE was descent but music selection remains obscure.

Alitalia,10.0,Catalin-Alexandru Epure,12th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Santiago de Chile to Berlin via Rome. Because the economy fares around Christmas and New Year were pretty expensive, I got an business class ticket for Alitalia, going from TXL to EZE and back from SCL, which was almost half of the price a normal trip like this would cos in business. I was a little afraid Alitalia will go bankrupt before my flights but I did risk it and the service I got was worth the money. The business class inside Europe is not a big deal, the legroom a little more and a meal served which was good. On the long haul side, it was almost perfect and I think this is how flying was used to be back in the 90s or 2000s. A lot of legroom, the seat turns into a bed, a huge screen with pretty good entertainment program, a lot of attention from the crew.

Virgin America,3.0,Chi Duong,21st January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Orlando. Not really worth the money. The first time I flew with them from Orlando there was a 2.5 hour delay without advanced notice. They stated the reason that there was a lot traffic in LAX. I wish they could have let us know earlier, not when we were at the gate. The second time I flew back from LAX. My car seat was missing and then they delivered it to my home later in the week. However, the car seat was broken when we received it. I called them to locate the missing part so that we could fix it ourselves. People that spoke to were nice but they did not do anything to help me solve the issue but told me to call different departments. Finally I was told to call central baggage which is voicemail only department. Called and left voicemail twice but never got a call back. Our car seat is for our new first baby which is designed for use up to 2 years and we could only use it for 2 months. Another thing is that I wasnâ€™t asking them to pay or compensate, I was just asking to help find and deliver the remaining part to us so we could put the car seat together and fix it ourselves but they never contacted us to give us an answer. The ticket was $350 round trip but our car seat-strolller system cost about the same. Itâ€™s even more costly to fly with virgin America.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,A Watson,26th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Delta Air Lines from Seattle to Atlanta. The telephone service is absolutely terrible. I tried to call reservations multiple times over the past week. I had delays of 40 min to 2+ hours. Most time I could not get through. The space under the seats in the First/Business Class cabin on the B737-900 ER has been severely reduced. I do not know about the economy section. There are 3 black boxes under the seat and a 120 V plug. This makes it impossible to store anything under the seat ahead of an aisle seat. The space has been reduced in the right to left dimension and in the top to bottom dimension. In addition, the Boeing seat struts are poorly designed so that there is little space for the aisle seat under the seat ahead & there is dead useless space. In effect the under-seat space is divided into 3 compartments for the aisle seat. The 1st photo shows from right to left: the bar by the aisle, 1st black box, metal seat strut, 2nd black box. The 2nd photo shows the AC outlets at the top and the 3rd black box next to the other seat strut.",Boeing 737-900ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,SEA to ATL,July 2016,2.0,4.0,,,4.0,1.0,no

Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto.

I will start with the good American has finally come into the 21st century and provides individual screens for in flight entertainment but still not nearly as good as Virgin America which also offers many free viewing options TV etc. Chargers USB are improved as well. Now the bad - the leg room and more so the seat/tray table configuration (even in premium) is appalling and even worse if the person in front of you reclines their seat which is highly likely. In my case they did and my drink ended up in my lap. If the seat in front is reclined you are pretty much trapped. The head rest ""wings"" that allow you to rest your head from side to side are so small anyone with a normal size head could not possibly use. They are ridiculous. The seat pocket basically holds nothing forget stocking up on magazines and books for your long flight as you will be carrying them in your lap or chucking them on the floor. Though it's nice to fly in a nicer and newer plane it is just shocking that no consideration was given to traveler comfort on these new planes especially if you are a over 5'2"".

We had the feeling that they were annoyed about our presence in the plane. I have never experienced such unfriendly staff in my life. In addition 4 hours late without even explaining the delay. The Inflight-entertainment system itself was not bad. I would say slightly below average but still okay. The problem were the headphones. The headphones were so bad that you could not understand a word. So we could not watch a single movie during our 10 hour flight. At least no movie with sound. Food was standard. Neither good nor bad.

They also lost our luggage but they apologized and compensated us appropriately sending a check in a very timely manner.

United Airlines,1.0,C Parker,6th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Kansas City. United Airlines was terrible from the moment we stepped foot in the airport. One employee would tell us that our bags would be fine to carry On, while another would tell us that we'd have to check them, just minutes before boarding when it was already too late. We ended up being stuck in San Francisco, CA and needed to just take the second leg of our trip instead of starting with Bakersfield to San Fran, San Fran to Kansas City because we ended up being stuck in San Fram due to a family emergency. We called customer service and explained the situation to which they replied that our entire flight would have to be cancelled due to a ""No show"" since we wouldn't be on the bakersfield to San Fran flight. We explained the situation again and stated that we'd still be paying for the flight but just wouldn't be on it. They eventually said that they got it taken care of and that we could take the San Fran to Kansas City flight and skip Bakersfield so we were under the impression that everything was taken care of. The next day (the day before the flight), we went to check in to our flights and were unable to do so on the United Airlines app on our phones. We called customer service again and were told that our flight was cancelled completely and that we were going to owe $380 each plus what we had already paid for our flights in order to get them reinstated due to ""fare changes"" and we would have to take the Bakersfield to San Fran connection again. We explained again that this was not possible and what we were told the day before about not having to take the bakersfield part of the flight and that we were told everything was taken care of. The customer service representative stated there was nothing they could do and that we'd have to pay the fee and take the connecting flight if we wanted to make it back to KC. When asked to speak with a manager we were placed on hold for almost 30 minutes and then they came back to tell us that it was a mistake on their end and we were able to take San Fran to KC with no additional charges. While on the San Fran flight the flight attendant was extremely rude. There was a line of people trying to board and she attempted to push past me to close one of the overhead compartments. I asked her if she could wait until we sat down and she said, ""I need to close these now! They're full! Back up for a minute"" In a very brisk and rude manner. She was slamming the doors on the compartments and pushing past people. A couple minutes later when she seemed to be over her tirade, another gentleman on the plane asked her if she was having a rough day. She stated, ""I left something expensive on one of the other planes and they wouldn't give it back."" He said, ""I'm sorry to hear that I hope your day gets better."" To which she then continued to go slam more of the overhead compartments and order the passengers around. My entire United Airlines experience has been awful and we will not be using them again. Terrible customer service is an understatement.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Kansas City,March 2018,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,9.0,M Leong,14th January 2015,JFK-NRT-SIN. Lounge at JFK was nice the flight was long and seats were narrow. The food could be improved but then again the catering was from JFK so my expectations weren't high. Crew were fine and overall the flight was good. Wish I used the showers in the NRT lounge as I was in for a longer wait than expected. Departure was pushed back an hour and we waited another hour and a half on the ground due to traffic. The staff handled the delay well and the wait was more comfortable than expected. Landed in SIN at 3am as a result. Still good experience overall.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

American Airlines,5.0,P Barchas,28th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to San Francisco. The plane was quite a new one, looked okay to me. The seat size in economy was quite alright for this type of plane. I suppose it is quite a failure if the only free service onboard was non-alcoholic beverages and a mini-bag of pretzels. No meal is provided for a 6-hour flight and the purchase options are very poor and not clear (it differs based on time and route). The in-flight entertainment on the contrary was a surprise - it worked well and the movie selection was quite wide. What I really don't understand is the seating allocation policy of the airline - we used it twice, always used the recommended kiosk self-check in option and in both cases we got a boarding pass with no assigned seats along with a note ""please see agent at the gate"", which we did and we got the boarding pass from him. I don't see the point of this weird policy and I don't like it.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to San Francisco,2018-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,no

Not only are their planes horribly outdated, but the staff and flight attendants are rude. I flying to be at a wedding this weekend and I'm horribly sick. I asked a flight attendant for help lifting my carry on bag and she rudely said if I couldn't lift it myself I'd have to go back and check it because lifting baggage isn't her job.

Lufthansa,9.0,Arthur Mosher,4th March 2015,"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,10.0,S Baker,5th January 2015,We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

I noticed they have improved their IFE with new functionalities. The food portions became a bit smaller on the European routes but bigger on intercontinental ones. Food quality was good. Generous choice of beverages but rounds could be more frequent. Both flights packed. Cabin crew nice on the first leg, way warmer on the longer segment. On the way to Singapore, due to traffic congestion at Istanbul airport, plane took off with a delay of one hour but landed in Singapore on-time. Toilets were kept clean and are now getting stocked with new nice amenities (flowers, high-quality hand lotions and hand cream) which on other airlines you would find on business class only. Seat pitch on the A330 is quite poor compared to the Boeing 777. As an Elite member, I could use on-board Wifi at no charge and the connection was stable and very good considering the altitude. Priority-tagged luggage was delivered in less than 15 minutes in Singapore.

Made use of the Business Class Lounge whilst on a 10 hour transit in Dubai which was excellent with great facilities - had to pay GBP 80 for the privilege but it was worth it.

We arrived at the gate to find out our flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK was delayed 2 hours due to air traffic in the Washington area. 2 hours later and there is still too much traffic to fly through Washington so we had to change routes to go around. Great idea if only they had the brains to think of this sooner. Now we are finally on the runway and they just realized that the flight time would be longer due to the new route. Turns out we don't have enough fuel. So back to the gate we go. This has been the worst travel experience of my life. To add to it all they ""ran out"" of headphones.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Arron Zidane,9th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | London to Khartoum via Doha on Qatar Airways. My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland. It seems that the service on routes like to/from Khartoum leaves a lot to be desired as does the fact that they still use remote stands and the food in general was a let down.",A350 / A321 / A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Khartoum via Doha,2017-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,yes

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Erin McCamley,14th January 2016,"When I have flown with Delta in the past, the comfort of the actual flight was great. The customer service, however, is a nightmare. I booked a roundtrip flight, and then had to cancel because of scheduling. I cancelled my entire flight within 30 minutes of booking it. I called Delta to confirm I had cancelled and would receive a full refund. The service agent told me everything was confirmed and I would receive a full refund because it was within 24 hours. 8 days went by and I hadn't received a refund yet. I called Delta on 3 different days and was hung up on, transferred, put on hold, and hung up again on multiple times. The third day, I finally got a hold of a real person and told her my predicament. She said ""That did not occur. That confirmation number you gave me doesn't exist. You'll have to apply for a refund through the website and then it will be up to the auditor's discretion whether or not you receive a refund."" I said, ""But now it's been 8 days, so the auditor will refuse to refund me. I cancelled it within 24 hours - in fact, within one hour - and received confirmation that I did. Are you seriously telling me that whoever I spoke to 8 days ago was just making stuff up and now I'm just out $1200 for no reason?"" She was condescending and cruel, cutting me off. Her official response was that what I was saying never happened and there was nothing anyone could do. All I could do was apply for a refund and the rest was up to the auditor. If I had been able to reach a live person one of the other days I had called, or if the person I had spoken to that night had actually confirmed my cancellation, I would have $684.70 to pay other bills. $684.70 is way too much money for me to just lose.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,M Galerko,7th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: ""Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It's okay"". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay.

The representative at Munich customer service rebooked me in a bulkhead seat and then had me driven to the departing terminal to a special service center for the disabled or injured.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,Stepan Hrobar,29th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flying KLM from Taipei to Amsterdam. The original flight scheduled for September 27 was cancelled because of typhoon hitting Taiwan, but KLM informed us even the day before (they cancelled the AMS-TPE flight as well) and they sent us new boarding documents immediately. As our schedule has been postponed for 24 hours, I contacted the KLM support via Facebook, which was very effective and friendly option of customer care, they even offered us another flight on the original day of departure with China Airlines, but we chose to stick to the original rebooked flight mostly because of the typhoon (the CI finally departed with a huge delay). The Facebook support also helped us arrange the seats we wanted to, very good way to communicate with customer! The flight itself was just OK. Their B777-300ER in the original configuration (no new economy class) feels very cramped and a little outdated, the seats are not very comfortable, IFE has a great selection of movies, but is very slow and only controllable via remote (which sometimes did not work properly). We paid a little extra to get the coupled seats in the rear of the cabin, and it was definitely worth it, but still for a 13 hour flight it wasn't ideal. Food was good, quite lot of fresh fruit and vegetables. But what made the flight awesome was the crew, they were just great. Smiling from the beginning to the end. After a small chat with us when they found out this was our honeymoon, they came with a glass of champagne for us and and a card, what a beutiful experience! So overall very positive, KLM's customer care is great, just watch out for aircraft type, because this B777 definitely isn't the most comfortable option.",Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,TPE to AMS,September 2016,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Emirates,8.0,John Hamill,27th October 2015,"Flew Emirates in Business class from Budapest to Shanghai via Dubai. Check in was fast and able to use fast track security. Emirates use the Skycourt lounge in Budapest which is nothing to write home about. Cold food offering, cheap wine and some spirits. Seating was comfortable, but no natural light in the lounge at all. A330 is the Achilles heel of Emirates. I am not sure how they can get away with sending such an uncompetitive aircraft to Budapest. The seats are narrow, recline is limited and are terrible for anything more than a few hours. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and chatty. Overall, not a bed flight apart from the seats. Used the Emirates lounge in concourse B which is excellent. The food and drinks offerings are outstanding and there are a number of great seating options. The lounge is truly enormous and it would be easy to spend a long time in here. I was actually disappointed when I had to leave. The only complaint was the shower room was extremely hot which made getting dressed very uncomfortable. Second flight on an A380 was excellent. The seat is very comfortable and offers great privacy. Being a night flight, service was limited so as to let people sleep. I put the seat in lie flat mode and slept for the best part of 6 hours. Breakfast was served before arrival in Shanghai and it was once again, very good. On arrival in Shanghai, first and business class have a separate baggage carousel and bags arrived promptly.

United Airlines,7.0,E Linaker,2nd May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Overnight flight from Newark to Heathrow. We upgraded to premium economy for this flight and it was my first experience with UA. Boarding was smooth, assigned a row to join which was marked on the boarding pass. Welcomed on board and found the seats, two of us travelling and we discovered that no one was assigned to the third seat in our row which made it a bit more comfortable. Legroom was good although seat width felt a bit narrow and looked to be the same as economy. That was about it in the way of 'perks' compared to economy as far as I could see. As for the flight, one hour delay in taking off and strong winds delayed our arrival. Good choice of entertainment. Meals were reasonable and I managed to get a brief nap. I had a look at the economy legroom and it looked poor, so I was glad we upgraded but I would class it as only extra legroom rather than a premium product.",Boeing 767-400,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,EWR to LHR,March 2016,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Aeromexico,,S Moseley,13th February 2013,Will never fly with them again. We missed our Aero Mexico flight to LA through their incompetence and consequently our onward connection to Australia that evening. Ground staff were next to useless and we got the run-around for 4 hours being passed from one supervisor to another with no-one wanting to take responsibility with lots of shrugging of shoulders. We had to organise our new flights ourselves at some cost to us. Once on board the premier class is just like premium economy although its supposed to be the equivalent of business class. Food and service is basic. I believe they have plans to fly from MEX to LHR shortly. They will have to lift their game to be any competition to existing carriers on that route.

The cabin service is outstanding - friendly and supremely efficient but never intrusive. Wonderful food beautifully served and every kind of drink you can think of! The airport in Doha is like a five-star hotel and the assisted passenger service puts Heathrow and Edinburgh to shame. We had a transfer time of just over an hour between our flights and our suitcases were waiting at the carousel when we arrived. A great improvement on last year's experience from Heathrow to Edinburgh when we had four hours between flights and British Airways only managed to deliver one of our suitcases 36 hours later!

Turkish Airlines,5.0,T. Eldem,9th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Prague on Turkish Airlines. Following a smooth check-in processed by a helpful and pleasant agent we made our way to the lounge. The lounge was crowded but there was ample space compared to the cramped, noisy and hot main terminal. Istanbul airport is a nightmare unless you have access to the Turkish Airlines lounge. After a few beverages and snacks we made our way to the gate. Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FAâ€™s was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline. They are rude, unprofessional and have extremely poor language skills.

Not only did Turkish Airlines not tell us this until we arrived in Istanbul, they basically yelled this at us and then the agent walked away from the desk - worst customer service experience ever. Had we known this, I would have had no problem making hotel plans for that night prior to arriving of course but after experiencing this bad service we were then left to find a hotel for the night in a city we had never been to.

We were lucky enough to get a discounted fare so that Business Class was a bit cheaper than the economy class fares available. On the MEX-DFW leg plane was an old and a bit worn out MD80. Good flight with a really kind and helpful flight assistant who spoke a perfect Spanish. I don't fly AA often but I must admit that I've always found nice and smiling staff both in business and economy class. Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff.

We could board the 2.15 pm flight to Dubai. We were told to go to the National Express (bus) counter and get a bus to Heathrow. The bus arrived about 40 minutes later and we arrived at Heathrow at 1pm at the central bus station. It seemed to be about 1 mile walk to the Emirates check in. No trolleys were allowed on the walk : there were several trolley barriers during the walk. When we arrived at the Emirates check in we were not in their system. Emirates at Gatwick had forgotten to re ticket us. We had to go to the Emirates counter to get ticketed and then back to check in. We were then the last people to be seated and we could not sit together. When I boarded I was seated next to an enormous man who sat with his legs apart and his arms spread out invading my seat space. My economy Emirates ticket was AUD $2800 which is very expensive. I'd traveled to France in May 2015 and my ticket was AUD $1700. We only got seating to Dubai and our boarding pass from Dubai to Brisbane was marked as standby even though we were picking up our original flight from Dubai to Brisbane.

American Airlines,3.0,M Erickson,26th October 2015,"I booked a flight from Paris to Columbus, with a stop in New York (JFK). Shortly after booking my ticket, I noticed that American Airlines allowed just more than an hour to make the connection. Since I would be coming into JFK on an international flight, and would need to go through customs and re-check baggage before continuing on to my connecting flight. I become concerned about the time crunch and called American Airlines to verify that I would have enough time to make the connection. They assured me that I would, so I moved forward with the planned itinerary. When I arrived into New York from Paris, I was pleased that American Airlines had sent an employee to wait for me at the gate to give me an expedited pass through customs so that I could catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately, after clearing customs, I waited for an additional 30 minutes to get my checked baggage, so that I could re-check it. I literally ran the entire way through the airport to catch my flight. I arrived at my gate exactly 9 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off, but the flight was already gone. Not only was the door shut, but the airplane was already gone from the gate. This left me wondering why American Airlines authorized a flight to leave early when not all of its passengers had arrived at the gate. I was especially disappointed since I was traveling with my wife and infant son, and we were all very tired after a long day of traveling (we began our journey the day before flying with a different airline into Paris). An American Airlines agent at the gate kindly re-booked me for a flight the next day, but informed me that I would need to wait in the check-in line in order to ask about a hotel voucher. After waiting in line and speaking with a check-in agent about a hotel voucher, I was informed that since my flight from Paris was on time, they would not give me a voucher. I explained that I had run through the airport, and that the reason I had missed my flight was because my bags did not come through for more than 30 minutes after I had cleared customs. The check-in agent seemed to feel genuinely sorry, but reiterated that he would not give me a hotel voucher. Instead, I paid $300 to get a decent hotel on short notice. It is frustrating and unfortunate that American Airlines would feel it more important to avoid additional cost than to reimburse a customer for an expense that American Airlines had caused. American Airlines made two mistakes: They authorized a flight to push off early, even though they knew they had passengers rushing from a connecting flight. They did not give a hotel voucher even though they were late in getting checked bags to the carousel, resulting in a missed flight and need for a place to stay for the night. Nobody likes to be taken advantage of when they are vulnerable. This is how American Airlines treated me and my family. For this reason, I will avoid using American Airlines in the future when possible.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Columbus via JFK,August 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no
Emirates,1.0,S Hang,10th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,5.0,G Bos,20th August 2014,Having heard about KLM's new business class product being fitted on KLM's 777 fleet from April I was hopeful to experience it on my trip to Lima (after all why on earth did it take them so long to introduce proper flatbeds in the first place). No such luck the cabin crew told me the roll-out on the 777's won't now start till October. The old business class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration simply isn't what you expect on a premium airline. Also due to staff shortages there wasn't a fast-track channel opened up on boarding. The crew were excellent and to some extent made up for the lack in comfort and sophistication of the product but until the fleet is properly kitted out I'll avoid KLM for long haul flights.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,no

As usually on the route from California to Honolulu the aircraft was not the newest and the seats were not the latest either. And as usual the staff is rather older and more experienced (seniority principle on this routing) then on any other route on the planet. But the always friendy, smiling and efficient crew did more then compensate for old seats or plane. One staff did the cooking and the other one did the service. All in a very personal and efficient way, one felt like being already in Honolulu. The food and the drinks on offer were good and well sized.

United Airlines,5.0,K Ogao,24th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Houston. I've previously taken this route four years ago and I was expecting the same. Well, that wasn't the case. For a trans-pacific flight, the flight crew was not approachable or polite in any matter besides maybe two who did an excellent job. There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream. In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a ""rubber"" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie. The crew was not very presentable and mediocre, some of the crew looked like they just lazily put on their uniform without a care of how they looked. There were only two crew who had a smile on their face the whole flight. Some had the expression of regret for choosing their career as a flight attendant, some were just tired and wanted to go back to the crew rest, and some had great poise. The seat was rather decent for a 12-hour flight. Great legroom and recline degree and the cushioning are comfortable for sleep - there were even pillows and blankets. There was also an IFE screen on each seat but none of them worked the entire flight. The crew tried their best to reboot and get it to work but it wouldn't budge. No movies or TV programs would work but games and the flight map did. It was a good thing there was in-flight wifi which you can connect to use the United app where you can enjoy free entertainment with latest movies and TV shows free of charge. Before I went on this flight I flew into Tokyo Narita from Manila and arrived at Tokyo on-time at 2:50 PM but this flight was due to depart at 4:30 PM. So once I arrived my boarding pass didn't have info on the gate number but there was a United representative giving info specifically about that. Approachable and polite. The overall flight experience was decent - close to mediocre due to inconsistent cabin crew and meager cabin product compared to ANA who fly the same route on a higher level of service.",Boeing 777-200ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Houston,June 2017,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,no

Aegean Airlines,6.0,Nicolas Simonis,27th August 2013,I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise.

Air Canada,2.0,Michael Lipin,22nd May 2015,I was involuntarily bumped from a UA flight 3803 (an Air Canada code share) from Toronto Pearson to Washington Dulles on April 12th. I was in transit at Pearson en route from Tel Aviv to Dulles with an original layover of 2 hours 55 minutes. My initial flight AC 85 from Tel Aviv was late departing and arrived in Toronto at 5.50pm an hour and 15 minutes late. That still left me more than an hour-and-a-half to make it to flight UA 3803 scheduled to depart at 7.30pm. After disembarking from flight AC 85 and reaching Pearson's passport control an Air Canada attendant advised me to go through U.S. customs and proceed to my gate. I arrived at the gate on time at 7pm when boarding was under way. When my boarding pass was scanned a UA gate attendant said I could not board because the Dulles flight was oversold and I had been bumped from the flight some time earlier. No reason was given for the bump. The UA gate staff told me to speak to Air Canada about booking another flight back to Washington and I later had to cross the border into Canada and stay overnight at a hotel paid for by Air Canada. I boarded Air Canada flight AC 7354 to Washington DCA the next morning April 13th. After arriving at DCA I discovered to my dismay that the suitcase I had checked in at Tel Aviv was not on my flight.

Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight.

I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Amsterdam,March 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,no

Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight. Houston - Sao Paulo: 100% full flight (the norm for Brazil - USA flights). Long delay at the gate with no explanation. Leather type seats which I am not a fan of as they seem to cause you to slip down when sleeping. Headrest folds but does not stay in place. 767 very noisy (probably more because of the fact that I just got off a 787). But a clean cabin and good service. Again a reasonable main meal, good service and flight attendants constantly passing through the cabin with water. Let down by breakfast, only a little sandwich (not great at 0900h after 10 hour in the air). Very good inflight entertainment on both flight with good video monitors and a good selection of movies and TV shows (with a great option of being able to watch the shows on your tablet). Overall good flights but I will be looking for 787 services next time on United.","Boeing 787-8, Boeing 767-300ER",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to GRU via IAH,September 2016,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes
Southwest Airlines,1.0,Natalie Potter,4th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | I took a returning flight from SJO to FLL yesterday with my 68yr old father who has Parkinson's. When I got off the plane there was no assistance. It was a complete disaster trying to get through baggage, declorations, and customs. I booked my flight to SJO with Spirit Air, who clearly at booking gives option for Wheelchair Assistance. Everything on the Spirit flight went smoothly. Not the case at all with Southwest. It couldn't have gone any worse. When I contacted Southwest customer service, I was completely dismissed and was told it was the airports problem. I was also told I should have not used the app and booked online so I could drop down a box some place and choose Wheelchair assistance. Doesn't sound so handicap friendly. Regardless I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight so I could get this handled and was left on my own with my father who can walk far with consistent tremors and dementia.

Air Canada,1.0,S Moore,22nd April 2014,My wife and I booked a trip to the Caribbean in May 2013 to travel in early April 2014. We used a popular online service for our flight reservations. On our return trip back home to Michigan we had to go round about through Toronto switching airlines to Air Canada for our half hour last leg home. We arrived at Toronto to find that We had less than an hour to connect flights and our baggage wouldn't be checked through to our final destination so after waiting 25 minutes for our luggage and a long trek through a huge unfamiliar airport we missed our flight. But instead of putting us on the next available flight the attendant at check-in directed us to call ticket information. After about 20 minutes of being on hold we ended up at an information desk and they sent us back to the check-in counter where we encountered a gentleman who proceeded to blame us for the mix up arguing and threatening to charge us $250US to rebook. This went on for some time then after we had given up and were going to pay (again) for the flight he abruptly stopped rebooked the flight told us he was doing us a favor and we were on our way. What an ordeal after about a day and a half of traveling it was a nightmare.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,N Weale,24th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Honolulu to Dallas. The flight listed I didn't even make because this airline chose to overbook and make early online check in impossible for my class, the site quite literally read ""we currently don't have enough seats to assign one to you now, please check in upon arrival at airport for seat assignment"". I was using transportation provided by the airport so had no control over my arrival time, I did arrival an hour early and got denied a place so my flight got bumped. Didn't read anywhere that seats were first come first serve, would've booked Delta had I known. I've currently been stuck in the airport 8 hours and will be arriving 6 after my expected arrival time, absolutely outrageous. The American Airlines employee response to my ""inconvenience"" was ""well, this change won't be charged, and at least you'll make it home""....Are you kidding?! I didn't book the flight I got stuck on purely for the inconvenience to me, and round trip means you get to go home. She had the audacity to claim it could be worse and they could make me pay for their lack organization and counting skills, it's not that difficult American Airlines, simply count the seats on your airplane and stop selling tickets when you hit that number, account for the pilot and any staff needed on board, believe it or not it's that simple. They did provide a $12 food voucher at the airport that was only brought to my attention by another passenger who got bumped, not even an airline employee, nice gesture but doesn't make up for the 14 hours of my life I won't get back.

United Airlines,1.0,P Dushkin,2nd September 2016,"There are not enough exclamatory adjectives in the English language to describe how I feel about United Airlines. The airline - specifically its customer-facing operations - is simply terrible. My flight was from Moscow to New York on August 31st. On August 30th I get an automated email saying that my flight is scheduled as planned. I noticed that they had the wrong time of flight in the email. So, I went online and verified the correct flight time (a flight at the time they sent me didn't exist). When I arrived at the airport and began the check-in process there was no record of me in the system. The kiosks gave me ""not found"" and the personnel at the counters confirmed the same. My flight was in two hours and I was starting to panic. I called United Airlines and got an agent. I explained my situation, told the agent that it was urgent and I was about to miss my flight, and asked if I could speak to a supervisor. The agent put me on a very long hold and then disconnected me. After a number of similar calls to the call center I finally got an agent - an hour later - that told me that somebody at UA had deleted my record from the system on the morning of my flight and I no longer had a seat on that plane. Really UA? Wow. Given the number of long holds, disconnects, and agents not able to correctly diagnose and resolve the problem from the start, I missed my flight. I had to take a later flight that day which made a mess of my plans. I will not use United Airlines again. It bends my mind that an airline could simply remove a paying customer from a confirmed flight without notification and leave him to sort out the mess at check-in. A mess that was met, not with any apologies or concern for my predicament, but with endless hold times, disconnects, and supervisors that are ""too busy at the moment"". With so many choices, why chose an airline clearly doesn't give a damn about its customers? I certainly won't.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SVO to JFK,August 2016,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,1.0,no

Second time I have used this service third trip with Qatar. 787 economy seats uncomfortable the 3-3-3 configuration a strange choice. A330 service I flew on in June 2014 DOH-HKG seats were much more comfortable and 2-4-2 better. Metal box on floor on 787 restricts leg room.

I was pretty happy with everything overall. The seats were comfy, I ended up with a window seat with two empty seats next to me, which was great. The entertainment system was brilliant. Lots to choose from. The wifi didn't work too well, but that wasn't an issue. The staff were very polite and helpful, blankets, wet towels, warm towels, pillows and headphones all supplied. The food wasn't amazing but wasn't an issue either. The only thing I wasn't impressed with were the ground staff at Dubai.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,2.0,N Barker,6th June 2012,London to Moscow then Moscow to Shanghai. Experienced a poor service throughout except for the food. At check-in I asked if I could request an aisle seat or one with extra legroom (I'm 6ft 7ins) I was told I had to pay 50 pounds if I wanted it. Of course this made the journey very uncomfortable straight away as on both flights I was sat in between passengers. Both aircraft's were very old especially for the long haul Moscow to Shanghai. Entertainment consisted of a projector and white screen at the front of the cabin - the worst entertainment I've ever endured on a 9 hour flight. Staff seemed slow and unresponsive at times however did serve regular drinks and the food was nice. In future I would rather pay a bit extra with other airlines.

After sitting on the plane on the runway for an hour we were all told to exit the plane and wait in a very long line to figure out how to fix our travel plans. There were about 5 of us traveling to Honolulu who got completely screwed because we missed our connecting flight. The only option for us was to wait 12 hours for a flight to Vegas > Honolulu then a 3 hour delay before finally flying to Lihue for me. This means I missed my first night in my hotel. I was 14 hours late to my final destination. I missed my shuttle and had to pay for a taxi which was ridiculously expensive. When I wrote to JetBlue they refused to reimburse me for anything and gave me a $50 credit. You can't fly anywhere for $50. This company is worth hundreds of millions of dollars yet they can't afford to pay for their mistakes.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York,2017-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,M Sean,18th February 2015,Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squashed (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for an overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory!

United Airlines,3.0,Rane Ravindra,25th May 2014,BOS-IAH. I was traveling with my family for holiday from BOS-LAX via IAH. My son is severely allergic to nuts and we always carry Epipen with us. We informed United customer service agent in advance about the allergy they made a note in system and advised us to inform the crew on board. When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement. After take off they did announce in so low volume that no one really could hear anything. More than 3 million people in the United States report being allergic to peanuts tree nuts or both. I would like to warn those people in advance about the United Nut Policy.,,,Premium Economy,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,10.0,J Thorn,14th January 2014,AA27 ICN to DFW. 20/12/2013. First off Incheon Airport is a gem and it is easy access via express train from Seoul Station. On arrival at the check in we found a line that was moving along nicely. We arrived at the counter as a family of 3. I had a separate ticket as I was travelling back on a different date from my family. There was a hiccup with my ticket as they could not find the leg from DFW to AUS and we were travelling together. It took the check in lady quite a while to find it but we stood patiently as she was trying very hard. She finally had to give in and get a supervisor to help. All the while the other agents kept the line moving along and no one was stuck. The check in staff were all very apologetic and the supervisor finally found my ticket. She noticed that I am a Platinum level traveler and said that she would try to upgrade us all to Business Class. She was successful at it and we were given the upgrade. This made a huge difference as we were on our way home for Christmas and were not looking forward to that long flight in economy. The flight was 100% booked solid and not an empty seat was available. The staff were attentive and gracious. They went out of their way to ensure that our 12 year old son was comfortable and had plenty to eat and drink. Have to say that this was a very good experience from AA. Only drawback is that the entertainment system needs an upgrade. Screens are small and not a huge selection for an 11 hour flight.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful.

We arrived from Tehran in Istanbul at 12 am, where it was one big mess. We were supposed to fly to Amsterdam an hour later, which never happened. For three days we had to stay in 4-5 hour lines for a ticket to Amsterdam. They were not giving any helpful solution. The first date after 7 hours standing in lines, they gave us a boarding pass for a flight that was canceled the next day. The next day the gave us a ticket for a flight that was already full the day after. Finally after an hour of arguing with their manager, the 3rd day we got a flight back to Amsterdam at the end of the day.

United Airlines,5.0,K John,15th April 2014,"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam.

United Airlines,2.0,K Gaideshar,27th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Mumbai. United airlines had the worst customer service on the ground. I flew on Christmas. But even accounting for the holiday rush, their services were just unbelievably bad! To begin with, they had a common check-in for ALL flights. To add to the chaos, everybody was supposed to check-in at the kiosk and there was absolutely nobody to help in case somebody got stuck. At one point 5 out of 6 kiosks were unable to complete the check-in, stranding people behind. There was a separate queue for travel assistance, which had about 20-30 people waiting and only 1 counter was available for assistance. It took us about 1 hour 45 min to complete the check in and reach the security. On another note, I was traveling with my boyfriend and we wanted our seats together. We had selected the seats immediately after booking our tickets. The seats got reshuffled three times due to ""a change in the plane"" and ""the system"" reshuffled the seats such that our seats got separated. United surely needs to fix their ""system"" that is unable to do a simple one-to-one mapping and is somehow adding a random factor on its own.

Virgin America,3.0,M Kon,20th December 2011,LAX to JFK via connecting flight in SFO. Seats were okay flight was noisy all but the few passengers in first class are forced to use two bathrooms in the back which made for long waiting times and lots of people going up and down aisles. A lot of effort into having a trendy ambience but not attentive to efficiency and actual customer service. Upon boarding the leg from LAX to SFO we were notified that the cabin was full and they would need to start gate checking carry-on bags. However instead of bringing the gate checked bags back to the gate on arrival they sent them to the baggage carousel at SFO. Normally this would just be a detour and inconvenience but in this case I only had 20 minutes until my connecting flight boarded. A security guard told me my bag should've been checked to my final destination - if I had not checked with the airline desk I would've flown to JFK only to find my bag had been left in SFO. Overall this experience demonstrated poor organization and procedure with gate checking bags and poor customer service when problems arose. And on another note other airlines are already doing mobile device boarding passes to expedite checking in - not sure why Virgin doesn't do this when it otherwise tries to have a trendy and modern image of its airline.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,no

The flight to Dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in Dallas. I finally got to Lubbock at 10.50. The next morning I went on Southwest.com and went to see if my points had posted I found out they didn't so I called Southwest and they told me that I didn't receive my points because I missed my original flight.

American Airlines,1.0,Farouk Mogheth,23rd December 2013,Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin. Again no food onboard for a long flight. Will never consider this airline.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no
United Airlines,3.0,Bridget Cerny,27th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | My daughter and I flew to Heathrow from Lexington and our first flight via Chicago went well. Plane departed and arrived on time. Unfortunately, the next leg of the trip wasn't as good. We sat in the plane in the heat for over an our before the plane departed. Once we were in the air, I took off my shoes and unfortunately slipped on the plastic runner under my seat and broke my toe on the seat in front of me. I mentioned it to the flight attendant who said I could have a wheelchair waiting for me at the gate in Heathrow - I declined as I felt I needed to at least try to walk, this was the beginning of my vacation with my daughter. The next thing that happened was that my special food order (gluten free) wasn't available. They said they never got the order although I had specially made the order on-line before my flight. I had to make do with another meal and the same with breakfast. The exact same thing happened on my return flight to the U.S. even though I'd made sure the order was done on-line once again. On the return flight, the flight attendant went to first class to get me some fruit and cheese. The plane was so old and tattered (both ways), the bathroom had ashtrays inside. The entertainment was non-existent with a tiny screen on the seat in from about the size of two decks of cards. All of the movies started at the same time so we were unable to choose anything that hadn't already started. Even if I'd been able to choose something, it would have been impossible to hear as the plane was so loud that my ears were buzzing long after the flight. Everything was old and tattered. What has made me even more irritated is that I received an email asking me to rate my journey (both ways). I mentioned these things and haven't heard a word from United.

Now I had my boarding pass, my suit cases were on the plane, and my little dog was in tow. I said ""What, you've got to be kidding?"". This very rude employee brusque told me he wanted to my paperwork, which I gave to him. He told me I couldn't board the flight because I needed a letter from my doctor with her letterhead and I didn't have it. I told him I was never asked for that, just the AA form. He said the only way I could board the flight was to pay $250. I said I would if this would help expedite and we could sort it out later. Then he told me then I would need a dog carrier to board the plane, which I didn't have as this wasn't required for emotional support animals. I told him this was not right, I had followed the online requirements and showed him my AA form and my emails with the SAC (Special Assistance Coordinator). I asked him to call his supervisor, which he did. All of this took about 30 minutes. Now the plane was fully boarded and he was not going to let me on this flight. Seconds before the flight left, finally his supervisor agreed I could get on the plane. The doors were now locked to the hallway and he couldn't open them, he was having a meltdown, until another employee who had the gate opener helped him out. I was literally overwhelmed and terrorized (create and maintain a state of extreme fear and distress in (someone)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jetblue Airways,1.0,Ildar Mirayev,29th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Orlando. The experience is horrible. At the check in they had no vacant seats together so they didnâ€™t assign me a seat, saying they will do that at the gate. At the gate they gave us seats 7B, 19D and 24D!! That meant My 5 years old child was seating alone 5 rows behind me. The Jet Blue personnel is absolutely unprofessional, they didnâ€™t even apologize, and just blamed us by saying that we supposed to come earlier. The whole situation is ridiculous! Jet Blueâ€™s decision was: to put us on another flight or fly as it is! We asked a few people to change their seats but they refused the suggestion. When I buckled up My child he couldnâ€™t understand what is going on and of course started to cry. He didnâ€™t want to be separated or to sit with someone he didnâ€™t know, even though the couple next to him was very sweet. I was too stressed to deal with this and tried to talk to him about it. One of the passengers started to go around and ask people and finally she managed to put us together. I am so thankful to that woman. She said â€˜I am a mother of five and weâ€™ll make everything it takes for this guy to be with his momâ€™.

What everyone else is saying about this airline is true. The plane used from Boston to Miami looked nice and new from the outside, but it's a whole different story on the inside. Inside the aircraft, the interior is horribly outdated and not clean at all. The plane smelled horrible the whole way. Worst of all, there is no in flight entertainment. Large TV monitors every few rows and the one closest to me wasn't even working! The seats are so uncomfortable and the leg room is virtually non-existent. Many of the seats show wear and tear. The flight attendants were rude and have miserable personalities and act like they are doing you a favor in serving you.

American Airlines,7.0,D Hall,20th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to London Heathrow. Check in and bag drop were easy as a Premium Economy customer can use Priority where the lines are very short. This is conveniently located next to the Priority TSA security lane that I was able to use so I was airside in MIA about 15 mins after dropping my bag. Once airside, because I'm a Oneworld Sapphire cardholder, I was eligible to use a lounge. Whilst AA has more than one lounge in MIA I headed for the best one which is the Flagship Lounge. Lots of space and different seating areas and points for food and beverage to avoid bottlenecks. The hot food was superb and indulged in a little bit of this together with some champagne and really good Californian red wine. About a 5 min walk to board and most others had already boarded so there was no line at the gate, even though I had priority boarding if needed. The Premium Economy cabin is small, only 3 or 4 rows, with a bathroom right in front of the first row. I had no problem placing my hand baggage in the locker. The seats are very new and comfortable. I flew out Main Cabin Extra (MCE) just a few days earlier so could easily compare the seating. The IFE screen is noticeably bigger than coach as is the width of the seat. The legroom is very comfortable, with a foot rest, but to be honest only a couple of inches more than MCE, but several more than Main Cabin. The Premium Economy recline is really good, so you can create a fairly relaxed seating position overall. Proper ear surrounding headsets give a better sound offering for the movies, which are the same as offered in coach. We were offered drinks and pretzels within 30 mins of departure and the offering was the same as coach. Not much time passed before the main meal came out with more drinks. The food presentation was good, solid crockery and metal cutlery. But after this point, is where it fell flat. The main course appears to be bespoke for Premium Economy, presumably as an enhanced offering. A number of my fellow passengers had pre-ordered special dietary meal. There is also an option to pre-order your main meal even if not for dietary reasons. I had not done this. As a result I was offered no choice and given this bland, tasteless, protein free vegetable risotto. It is the most disappointing long haul inflight main course meal I have had in all my travels. Even more so because I was in Premium Economy. Thank goodness I'd earlier eaten in their Flagship Lounge. About an hour before arrival a light breakfast was served consisting of a fresh fruit plate, banana yoghurt and a small cinnamon pastry with tea or coffee and juices. This was fine, although a hot beverage refill would have been welcome. Despite the disappointing dinner, with the good seat comfort I got about 5 hours sleep. Bag delivered promptly at Heathrow with no issues. My verdict on AA Premium Economy: slick on the ground, very comfortable in the air, but didn't see the premium in the food and beverage offering. I'd fly it again depending on the extra cost over Main Cabin.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Premium Economy,Miami to London Heathrow,November 2018,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,A Ehmen Carlotta,25th June 2014,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,no

Air Canada,2.0,Ahmad Nadim,19th January 2015,In July last year my wife and I travelled from Manchester UK to Toronto. Queuing for check in: I am a wheelchair user. I don't demand it but most airlines let wheelchair users join a fast queue for Check in. I don't demand it but have to say that it is a polite gesture this polite gesture was missing with Air Canada. Check in: was chaotic with long queues and check in staff seemed all over the place. It took us almost 1.5 hrs to reach the check in counter only to see that half the check in counters were not even open. Boarding: As we arrived at the boarding gate and were showed boarding passes we realised that me and my wife had been allocated seats a few rows apart. To the credit of airline staff they quickly sorted this out and put us in premium economy. Although they told us that we will have to pay for the entertainment and food but once we were on board they did not charge us. Arrival in Toronto: Because I need assistance to get on and off the plane I have to wait until everyone has gone. Usually it takes 5 to 10 minutes but this time it took over 45 minutes for assistance to arrive because no one knew that a passenger needed assistance to disembark the plane. Please note that I had requested the check in staff in Manchester twice to make sure that people know in Toronto that I will need assistance. Luggage collection: Upset and frustrated we arrived in the lounge to collect our suitcase. Everyone from our flight had collected luggage and gone. No carousel information was available. First we tried to look for our suitcase and then I found Air Canada customer service counter and queued to ask which carousel our suitcase would have arrived at. All of this took another hour and half almost but still no staff was available to help. Eventually we found our suitcase near one carousel.

American Airlines,2.0,Richard Robert,28th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | There was a 13 hours stop over in Miami from around 9pm to 10am the next day but although they sold this as a flight to Mexico, American Airlines didn't provide night accomodation. For me it's more like I bought 1 flight to Miami and a flight to Mexico from Miami. My way back to Montreal, was the worst trip I ever experienced so far. First there was a problem at Mexico airport with American Airlines IT system so it took 3 or 4 hours to board on the plane to Charlotte. Then in the evening the flight from Charlotte to Montreal was cancelled due to a snow storm. From there American Airlines staff wouldn't make any announcement, they'd just let you die in the airport. Finally I got a flight to New-York La Guardia in a cold and ghostly airport where I spent the night waiting for the morning to catch some American Airlines staff.

Extremely small and uncomfortable plane. After telling me my carry-on bag was fine, they decided it was too big, as well as many other people, and made us leave our bags outside the plane without telling us where to get them. After the ride was over I had to search for someone to ask, where they made us all line up in the cold and wait for them. They may have actually told us, but whoever gave the instructions spoke such a poor excuse for English it was pathetic, and I really don't mind accents normally, as long as I can understand. They can't do the job if nobody can understand them and they just keep yelling and gesturing and even grabbing at my belongings because they can't compose a sentence to tell me what to do with them. I was also supposed to be in a row by myself, but out of nowhere the flight crew pulls out a seat behind the wall and blocks me in the aisle and completely blocks off the bathroom so nobody could use it and making one long row with no space in it.

Air New Zealand,1.0,E Lind,3rd September 2015,"We had the worst experience with Air New Zealand flying from San Francisco to Auckland on NZ7. When entering the aircraft, all overhead lockers closed and no Flight Attendant to assist. Went to the rear galley to find two staff, who advised no place to stow our cabin bags. Just ignored me then after several minutes one said I will stow it. Went to my seat. My wife had hers in her lap. 10 minutes later another attendant comes though with my bag asking who left the bag? I advised the other attendant said she would stow it. He then went off to find the original attendant and she stowed in in another locker away from mine. After dinner was served, just at our row ran out of wine and left with the cart to get some more. Then came back and went past us? Ten minutes later the attendant notices my wife and I as well as the window seat without a drink with our dinner, and asks did we forget you? Took our drink orders and then came back. By this time I was done with dinner. Cabin crew through the whole flight were just going through the motions. Not many smiles, or friendliness. When leaving the aircraft at AKL I handed my Air NZ Air Points Card to the attendant who gave us such poor service and said give this to the Flight Manager and advise that you have lost a customer as your service stinks. Upon arrival at AKL at 0555, at baggage claim they announce apologies will be a delay getting the bags off the plane. Twenty five minutes later they came. By then several other flights arrived and the Customs Hall looked like a mini version of LAX. By the time we got through and took the shuttle bus to the AIR NZ Domestic Terminal we missed our connecting slight to Dunedin that morning. The Air New Zealand counters were full of other delayed passengers. The first Air New Zealand agent tried to assist and said we have to wait until 6:05pm that night for a flight. Over ten hours wait! No compensation, hotel, etc. She then could not get us booked on the computer and ran away for assistance somewhere. 20 minutes later came back and advised another agent would come and help us and left. After waiting around thirty minutes I lined up and got to meet the Supervisor to advise her it looked like we had been abandoned? She apologised and booked us on the flight that night and gave us $18.00 of food vouchers for the two of us, for our 10.5 hour wait on the leather covered benches in the Air New Zealand Domestic Terminal.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to AKL,August 2015,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

However, due to snow Turkish Airlines decided not to send the plane from Istanbul to Dushanbe. Despite the fact that FlyDubai and Somon Air both managed to get their flights in and out. If that were not bad enough the next time they said they would be flying was 2 days later on Monday. But it is now Monday and they have had the better part of two days to deal with the snow and the weather is crystal clear in Dushanbe. But is the flight coming on time? No. It is delayed 5.5 hours, assuming it arrives at all. That has destroyed the rest of my itinerary. I am going to have to spend the night in Istanbul as a result in the best case scenario. This is not the first time Turkish has screwed up my travel.

I can say without hesitation this is by far the worst airline in the world I have ever flown with. I have had multiple occasions of delayed flights, sleeping in airports, damaged and lost luggage (steel reinforced cases may I add that still get smashed), rude customer service agents, missold upgrades and rude flight attendants. I have been offered a $400 voucher in compensation of all of these however when I tried to use it, they said it's not valid for anything other than booking new flights. So my existing flights that are booked months in advance, I cannot use this on. Naturally, I don't want to fly again with United so the compensation is useless. Honestly, I can rant all day about these guys but they don't care anyway so realistically there is no point.

I sit here at gate D25, waiting to board a flight I shouldnâ€™t be on, more frustrated than Iâ€™ve ever been with an airline. Iâ€™ve had one bad experience after another with American Airlines. I arrive to gate T9 around 5am and immediately go to the check in desk because Iâ€™m flying Basic Economy for the first time so I want the gate agents to know that Iâ€™m here and would like a seat number for the flight. One rudely responds, â€œWeâ€™ll call your name when weâ€™re ready for that.â€ I sit down patiently waiting for my name. Finally my name is called, and she asks me if my small duffel bag is the only bag I have? I respond that yes it is. Another agent chimes in that it looks like it it is too big and that I will have to pay for it. I respond that it should fit under my seat, so I put it in the demonstration bin and of course it fits. They tell me they just wanted to see my bags and that I can sit back down and wait for the next instruction. When it comes time for boarding group 9 to board, I wait for my name to be called. (now apparently there are two individuals with my last name, and the other individual is flying standby. But I donâ€™t find this out until later.) they ask the group to walk with them down the runway and wait for a seat number. I ask the agent when I can board since I paid for a ticket, she asks the other agent about me who checks her list and says that â€œYouâ€™re not on my list!â€ They give up all seats on the flight and I have now missed my flight. We get back to the desk at which point Iâ€™ve never had two grown women be so disrespectful to me. They both blamed me for not getting on the flight. Saying the flight had two Individuals with my last name but not once did they call a first name. I now know that neither Individual with my last name made the flight.

American Airlines,2.0,K Dorley,1st October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Dulles to Tulsa via Dallas Ft Worth. I scheduled my flight allowing for a 2 hour layover since Dallas airport is known for delays. My flight from Dulles was delayed 45 minutes due to a circuit board issue. Once we finally arrived at Dallas, we had to wait around 30 minutes on the runway because there was a plane at our terminal. Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldnâ€™t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying â€œwe donâ€™t have all the time in the world to help people that arenâ€™t on this flightâ€. Again, that flight didnâ€™t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance. The 3 workers there were all on their cell phones, which they didnâ€™t put down when I arrived for help. I explain the situation and also told them I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received at the other desk. 2 of the workers giggles and rolled their eyes while on their cell phones. The gentleman helping respond, â€œthere are more customer that missed their flight than just you, those workers have to managed many customer with specific need, this desk has all the time in the world though. I have you on a new flight, have a nice dayâ€. Iâ€™m happy the gentleman was more â€œwelcomingâ€ than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company. In addition, the delays were extremely annoying when you had planned ahead as to avoid the problem of a missed connection.

Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations. The Istanbul Ataturk airport also has plenty of shopping and eating options, smoking area.

American Airlines,6.0,Davide Greco,29th December 2015,"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.","Boeing 737-800, Boeing 767-300",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to MXP via MIA,December 2015,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no
Lufthansa,1.0,C Whitten,11th August 2014,Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,6.0,Russell Gibson,20th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Athens. When we received the email from Emirates to check in we were offered an upgrade to Business for $600 per person. We took it, thinking that we would be wowed by Emirates world class service, food and reputation. Read on. After checking in online we called to find out more about Emirates' car service, knowing we were outside the 50 mile radius we were willing to pay the difference. ""No' we were told, ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so you are not eligible"". Really? Even if we would pay for it? After we checked in at the airport we asked where the lounge was located. ""No"" we were told ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so that doesn't get lounge access"". Funny, didn't see mention of that when Emirates took my $1200. (we got into the lounge any way). Boarded an old 777-200. It was late (almost midnight). We had a nice cocktail and dinner and went to sleep. Forgot to put the sticker on my shirt and so 2 hours before landing, and in the middle of a nice deep sleep, was awoken by the FA who asked what I wanted for breakfast (even though he could see I was sound asleep). My husband was out like a light and the FA said ""I guess he doesn't want breakfast"". Astute observation. Before I went to sleep and after I woke up I tried to find something to watch on the IFE. Nothing. It was late so there was no question that we would be sleeping, but the seat was not full flat and the hard arm rests were hard to maneuver around.

Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320.

Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

I found a great ticket price and thought the drive to Cincinatti was worth the hundred dollars I saved however, the experience is one I will never forget. The best I can say is you get what you pay for. Although the inflight service was excellent in the old planes and the flight attendants were warm and grand, the check-in counter people are subpar and definitely not worth the hassle of traveling with the company. I have chosen to just pay the extra dollars, plan ahead of time, and never fly with American Airlines again. The online response team gets back to you quickly with a response. However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue. For sure you need to get to the airport 1.5 hours early because simply checking in takes 15-20 minutes per person. I didn't see anyone come to the front and get thru their process swiftly.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,10.0,L Roestad,11th April 2014,OSL-AMS-HAV. KLM is a really good reliable and above all friendly airline. A330-200 for AMS-HAV means much better seat-width than sister-airline Air France's 777-300 used on CDG-HAV a far more comfortable 2-4-2 seating than the 777`s 3-4-3 and of course only half the amount of passengers making arriving formalities in HAV much faster. Still the success-key is the cabin crew and the in-flight service standard. First pre lunch drinks with pringles then a hot towel followed by a good hot lunch (choice of main) and after collecting meal trays: coffee/tea with cognac/liqueur. Ice cream was offered with coffee (and/or drinks) mid-way + several offerings of water/coke/juice through flight and a hot towel again before a new hot snack/meal in good time before landing. All this offered by crew members who seem to enjoy their work. Who can ask for more in economy? (Have flown KLM several times on long hauls and this seems to be their standard service program in economy). Hopefully some day in the future KLM/AirFrance will lean totally on KLM`s service standards.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes
American Airlines,8.0,Connor Sadler,22nd February 2016,"I flew with American Airlines to Tampa, Florida from Manchester. The flight arrived delayed from Philadelphia due to departing traffic so we had a delay. We boarded with a friendly greeting from the staff. The flight departed, and excellent food and beverage service was provided. The Inflight Entertainment system was a very good one in my opinion. We landed on time in Philadelphia with a very brief connection. We got onto the next flight with very friendly Ground Staff, on time departure. There was sufficient service for the short two hour flight, drinks and snacks. No In-Flight entertainment but a very bad WiFi connectivity, if you tried to use the free edition. We landed on time in Tampa but had baggage issues due to weather, where the bags couldn't get off due to lightning. The staff kept us updated though and were very helpful. After 3 hours from arrival, we left the airport. Amazing service from American Airlines.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,M Zhang,23rd January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to New York JFK. Delta One is decent as a transcontinental business product. On the Boeing 767-300 it is a 1-2-1 staggered layout. However, the shell of each seat is way too short, creating a less private experience. The catering service was great. Three entree options were provided and were accompanied by an appetizer, a salad, a soup, and some deserts afterwards. Delta uses Westin's Heavenly bedding onboard all of their Delta One flights which was very comfortable. However, the poor design of the seat caused the situation where there was no room for my feet to move when the seat is in its lie-flat position. The flight crew was very friendly. Onboard Wi-Fi was useable but extremely slow.

Emirates,5.0,Annabel Hurrell,26th August 2015,"It's such a shame for the incompetence of their ground staff in johannesburg. I've never seen such shambles in my life. We were flying with our two 8 month old twins and 10 year old son. When we got to Johannesburg airport we already done online check in so just went to check out bags in. We waited right in front of the queue for a half hour because staff didn't know what they were doing then finally we got helped, it took the women another half hour to just check our bags in then she got all worried then told us she made a massive mistake, she put the previous passengers name tags on our bags so she had to change all the name tags. However, 2 bags were already sent down so she said she will go and change those tags. We quickly went to say goodbye to family and rushed through because we were running late due to the bag situation. While standing in the queue for ages at passport control one of the staff came and shouted at us because we holding the flight up I explained to her it was due to their incompetence we were late not ours - she rudely rushed us to the gate and saying one of our bags is at suspicious bags because there's a toy gun or aerosol can in it - neither of those items in it. When we got to the gate 15 mins before departure we were rudely spoken to by the other staff saying that we were kicked off. One of the staff members walked us to get our bags and out of departures lounge to rebook our flight. Then they realise that they put our tags on someone else's bags so two of our bags was missing, and other passengers wouldn't have their bags either. After 3 hrs of trying to locate our bags they finally decided that they think that our bags were on the flight to London. When rebooking our flight for the next day, they wanted to charge us an extra Â£500 per adult even though it was their fault we missed our flight. After speaking to the supervisor she said the only thing she can do to help us is only charging us a no show fee that was still Â£160. The next day got to the airport they said they've got us on the stand by 13:50 flight to Dubai so we will have 9 hrs transit in Dubai. When we got to Dubai we had to get our boarding passes for the next flight only to realise then that the staff at Johannesburg decided not to book our 2 infants on the next flight - luckily the staff at Dubai was helpful and helped us to book them on to the flight. The last straw was when our pushchair went missing due to Johannesburg staff incompetence again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to London via DXB,August 2015,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,yes

United Airlines,8.0,N Miller,6th September 2014,SFO/IAH/SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) /IAH/SFO in First on domestic Business on the international flights - 737-900 and 737-800 - pleasantly surprised by the service which was almost perfect (only 1 FA on 1 flight was rude when I was forward enough to ask about whether there would be dessert). New lounge at SFO is still pretty bad considering it's a UA hub and supposed to represent the USA to the Pacific Rim but it was adequate (although be warned the bar closes at 10.30pm sharp not so good for those of us on midnight flights). Food on 1 flight also not so great (overdone tasteless steak) but otherwise good - I think they serve starbucks coffee because it tasted so burnt I could only drink 1/3 cup even though we were going on 30+ hours with no sleep by the time we were landing in Costa Rica. All in all we were happy with the flights unexpectedly so given some prior experiences with the carrier.,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Aeromexico,2.0,Colin Moran,4th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Mexico City to Washington. I was traveling from Cabo San Lucas to Washington, DC. My connection flight was in Mexico City. I spent $25 USD on my first flight from Cabo to Mexico City to upgrade my seat, as well as have zone 2 boarding. That flight was great. On my connecting flight from Mexico City to Washington, DC I spent $75 USD to upgrade my seat and have zone 2 boarding. Before boarding I was called up to the front desk by a AeroMexico representative, who I informed immediately I did not speak Spanish. He told me that I was going to have a random bag check and to step to the side. I agreed, as this was no problem. There was a second gentlemen in front of me who was also having a random bag check. When he was finished, I was told by another AeroMexico representative to proceed to the security woman to check my bags. When I gave my passport and bags to the security woman (who I also informed I did not speak Spanish) she waved me through without checking my bags and said I was free to go. I walked down the ramp as instructed and started to wait in line to board my flight. 5 minutes later, the AeroMexico representative that was working the ticket counter came screaming down the ramp, yelling my name and making a huge scene in front of everyone in line. He would not let me talk and was yelling at me that I should have had my bags checked. I was trying to tell him that the security woman had waved me through and that I had stopped like he told me to to have my bags checked. He would not stop yelling and also put his hand on my shoulder pushing me forward. I was being treated like a criminal when I had nothing to hide and also followed his directions. Once he escorted me to the security woman at the top of the ramp she informed him that she had waved me through. He never apologized to me. My bags were checked and I was free to go. I was very embarrassed and scared that I had done something wrong when I had not. I do not appreciate being treated like this, especially when I paid extra money to have my seat upgraded.

American Airlines,1.0,H Chisnall,1st August 2015,Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home.

The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort.

My high rating reflects the stellar service and quality of the product in Business class its on a different planet to Economy Class. I snared an exit row seat at a $75 premium on the outward journey. There was plenty of leg room but the width of the seats seems like it is decreasing every time I'm on one of their 777-300's. Luckily I was on good terms with my neighbour. The night time trip down to the toilets is a nightmare having to manoeuvre your way through this obstacle course of legs blankets headphone cables in the aisles. I dread the day when the 747-400s are retired and the 777-300s are the only way to get to the US. Returning home in business class you were in a different world luxury space and privacy is the epitome of what this award winning airline does very well. The only thing that drops this review from a 10 to a 9 was the fiasco at LAX just before the plane departed when the ground crew decided everyone needed to have their cabin baggage weighed. It was a fiasco and yes I agree cabin baggage size and quantity needs to be monitored closely but the manner in which this exercise was performed at the departure gate in particular by one of the two ground staff it really was unprofessional.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

They claim there is no assigned seating but you can purchase ""Early Bird Check- in"" which they claim automatically checks you in 36 hours in advance instead of the usual 24 hours. So I purchased the Early Bird check in plan thinking that my whole family would be able to sit together. (Group A-so I thought). Surprise when I received my boarding passes we were in Group B which means you have less that a 50% chance of your family seating together. I called Southwest and was told that the Early Bird Check in does not guarantee anything it just gives you the best available boarding at that time Well they didn't tell me this when they took my money. So in order to ensure that my family would be together I had to spend more money and purchase First-In boarding passes (Group A) for an additional $40 per person (One way). The plane was small cramped no room to even think about being comfortable. I am an average size man (5'11 195 lbs). I can't imagine how someone bigger must have felt. Then imagine my surprise when the flight attendant announced to the final group of people boarding (Group C) to take the first available seat because they were saving the seats in the back for families so they could sit with their children. Twice I spent money to guarantee my family would sit together because they claim there is no assigned seating and now they are saving seats for families so they can sit together Are they serious!!

American Airlines,4.0,Peter Conlin,7th January 2016,"Check-in experience with American Airlines at Dublin was horrible-it took 45 minutes and during this time all passengers were subject to inept security 'interviews' with clueless AA staff. Invasive and pointless. After that we did the endless security and pre-clearence routine for a US bound flight out of Dublin. Took over 2 hours to simply arrive at the gate. Flight was on time to Philadelphia, late to Halifax. Food bad, but liquor offering good. Leg room was reasonable for today's Economy class. We were near the back of the aircraft, but this A330 has a sensible 2-4-2 configuration and we had the 2 by the window which is nice for a couple. Seat back entertainment didn't work for me, USB chargers on both seats didn't work. Cabin crew weren't exactly professional, and down right silly on the PHL-YHZ leg (not aware that Halifax has a different time zone, no idea of scheduled arrival time, generally inarticulate). The aircraft from PHL-YHZ (operated by American Eagle) had an old plane smell, and the bleak interior of the ERJ 145 seemed to be yellowing with age. Good communication from the pilots on this leg, which was necessary as there were repeated delays ending in a 30 minute broken down jetway farce at the Halifax airport.

There was no inflight entertainment, nor wifi or usb ports, but for a short 3 hours flight that was not critical. The cabin was quiet, no disturbing noise from engines.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,T Smith,12th November 2014,Flew from Toronto - Amsterdam and return. The first flight was one of the last for the MD11. The return was 747. The seats on the 747 were excellent. The upper deck was like a private room. Staff were first rate. The captain came and introduced himself as did the chief purser. Staff were attentive and often anticipated requests. The meal out of Toronto was fair at best but it always is. Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating. Wheelchairs had to push through with the result that people were stepping on each other. I mentioned this to the KLM attendant at the gate. She told me to write the management. Bottom line avoid Schipol for departures.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

An attendant coming home literally told my husband on our honeymoon we shouldn't of purchased these tickets if we wanted to sit together (making the assumption we are broke because we paid for economy tickets). I also observed the flight attendant turn down a mother and child to sit together. On the flight from San Antonio to Denver we asked to sit together for our honeymoon trip and all staff including the captain stated we could ask around but they would not help us. We ended up sitting separately on both connecting flights. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed in United Airlines punishing economy class fliers by splitting them up.

The quantity was more than ok. After the main course you receive a selection of typical greek desserts. A great red wine was served (Orgion 2014). After the dessert I had an Espresso (Illy).

Qatar Airways,9.0,C Down,8th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Bangkok to Gatwick via Doha. Ground service in Bangkok was mixed, check in and security were fine and very quick. Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I donâ€™t like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. Itâ€™s not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue.

The aircraft was new with the 3-4-3 layout in economy. The seats on KLM did feel a bit narrow however may be due to the design of the seat. But the legroom was amazing, the slimm seats give you more room. i could slouch in my seat with the person in front reclined and still have room to spare. The in flight infotainment was ok, a few movies were good, some good series but no where near as good as other carriers. I was expecting a larger screen, it was ok but could have been better. Each seat had a USB and plug socket, very helpful. The staff were great, very friendly and came round often enough with drinks, food and snacks. Couldn't fault the staff. I was sat in the first economy cabin, a few rows after the economy confort seats, so I was a bit annoyed that I couldn't have my choice on the inflight meal, so I had to get the pasta but it was tastey and the aribiatta sauce was nice.

Aeromexico,1.0,Linda Jimenez,24th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Guadalajara to Sacramento. This is our 2nd time flying Aeromexico. Last year was a complete disaster with the flight that was supposed to leave SMF 2315 and land in GDL 0515, instead leaving SMF st 0530! The entire nite we were given zero info/updates and only once offered a drink. The shops were closed, and my husband, is a diabetic controlled by diet so needs to est every 2 hours when awake. No employee would help us. Our return trip last year was 3 hours late. I am usually a glass half full type of person, so when this years annual trip to visit family was being planned I decided to give Aeromexico another chance. The dates/times/prices were the most convenient so we decided to give it another try. We never entered a complaint last year. This year our trip to GDL was uneventful. But the return trip we encountered the ticket agent from hell. We were never notified that the weight per luggage piece had been changed, and the carry on that should have been free, was 2 kilos overweight. Under then new guidelines, our 2 large luggage pieces were a combined 10 kilos underweight. We usually pay $25 each for the large luggage. At the GDL terminal u go thru the first line, then are given a piece of paper, have to go to a 2nd area, wait in line to pay for ur luggage, then return to the first line provide ur receipt and get ur ticket, not very convenient or fast) nothing was said by the ticket agent about overweight luggage, but when I went to pay I found I was going to be charged $114 for the carry on, which was 2 kilos over by the new guidelines. I pointed out that our total was still 8 kilos under, and that we were never notified of revised guidelines to no avail. I refused to pay, saying I would rather move 2 kilos to another suitcase. I was told to return to original ticket person and that he would return our luggage so we could make the changes. When i returned and told him what I wished to do, he put all 3 pieces of luggage on the conveyor where it automatically rolled to the back, gave us a paper with UPC codes, and told us we could get our luggage back ""down the hall"". I asked him numerous times where down the hall and he refused to say more. We looked ""down the hall"" to no avail, and no other Aeromexico employee were helpful. We finally asked a Volaris employee who walked us to an area that we would never have found. It took almost an hour to get the luggage returned. We adjusted the weight, and then had to wait in the LONG ticket line starting the entire process all over. It's a good thing we always arrive early for our flights! When we got to ticket counter again, the carry on was .03 over. The ticket agent was prepared to start the whole have to pay for this deal again. I pointed out that the total was still 8 kilos under and her response was ""and what does that have to do with anything? "" I quickly removed 1 pair of socks which put it at 9.90 kilos, under the magic 10 kilos. We have continually encountered employees for Aeromexico that are rude, unhelpful, and basically convey a could-care-less attitude. The only time Aeromexico seems to shine is when you are actually on the plane. The stewards are great. Excluding a very rough landing at SMF (bounced several times before finally staying down) the in air experience is great! Unfortunately that does not compensate enough for the issues you deal with while on the ground. Obviously last year was not a flux, we will not fly Aeromexico again!!!",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Guadalajara to Sacramento,2018-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

However, I was very very offended at the end of the journey by a porter. The lady who took me to get my luggage realized that she couldn't carry my bag outside and wheel me as well, so she asked a porter to help, a Spanish speaking man. He literally picked up the one suitcase and wheeled it outside. The lady left me in the wheelchair to wait for my ride. The porter then turned to me and said, ""well?"" ""Well what?"" I asked. ""I work for tip!"" He said. ""I'm sorry I have no cash,"" I said. ""Ha! You have no cash?? I work for tip!"" He said again. ""Leave me alone,"" I said. He then threw my suitcase on the ground and walked away. At this point it was midnight, my foot was in real pain and I was really offended by this.

I would rather pay for a decent breakfast/lunch/dinner then eat the garbage they offer in the Club for ""free"".

Apart from the minor issue with the seats everything else about the flight was more than acceptable. The food was good not great. We were offered a decent breakfast, however the coffee is dreadful and the tea no better. The flight attendants were attentive and very cordial the entire time. Flying back thru to EWR from PVR via IAH was just fine except for the disaster that is IAH security.

They wouldnâ€™t let me on my next one until I argued with them for a while and after they let me and others on they take us all the way to a 30 min take off spot only to take us back bc they decide to cancel it. Had to stay the night in the airport and was supposed to take off on another flight at 12, but only to have them have us get off bc technical issues.

I'm guessing because I interrupted the personal conversation she was having with the other rep, I know it was personal because they each made no attempt at concealing this detail. She then asked for my boarding pass and continued her conversation with the other employee. She printed my new boarding passes and placed them on the desk in front of me. All without stopping her conversation or looking me in the eye. After the flight, I get home and my laptop will not power on.

Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Shaun Casey,2nd September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. Itâ€™s the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that Iâ€™ve ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. Iâ€™m amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it canâ€™t even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience. Looking forward to seeing how they resolve my ongoing problems!

This was my first trip, using miles, to fly in Business Class. The crew was attentive, well-groomed and projected a nice, professional image. The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings. No menu, a surprise, and the crew rolled a cart down the aisle showing unwrapped entrees. I selected the fish and sad to say it felt like I was eating a 5TL fish sandwich on the Eminonou dock. The entrÃ©e was very poor quality, tasteless, and cheap. It cost me a lot of miles and a lot of euros to take this flight",,,,,,,,,,,,

There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far.

Something told us to speak to another Supervisor and their happened to be a man who politely listened to us and understood that we did not intentionally miss our flight because of the misunderstandings and as a courtesy he had our flight changed.

I should have trusted my instinct. A clapped out old A330, clapped out cabin design, the seat to be fair was comfortable and I did get a good sleep. Dinner service did not happen as they did not have enough beef to cater for the needs of their business passengers. Sat in seat 4J I was surprised to learn that you need to sit on the ""captains side"" of the plane if you want to get your choice of meal with Delta. The crew member I spoke to was wholly disinterested in any form of complaint and said ""Listen what do you want?"" Naturally I considered approaching the purser on the plane to speak to him about perhaps guiding his staff on how to deal with premium passengers. When I learned a few moments later that this guy was the purser I realised that my night was over and this was a bus service to Atlanta and that I should expect no level of service whatsoever. Looking for good things. The seat, thats it. Bring your own food, don't expect any manners, get on the bus, sit down, shut up and you'll get to your destination in one piece.

American Airlines,1.0,Bruce Kanin,19th April 2015,"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day.

United Airlines,1.0,N Perkins,27th July 2014,Ever since Continental merged with United it has been downhill. My flights are repeatedly delayed for various reasons but mainly due to technical issues because they have so many old planes still in service. On my most recent flight my flight was delayed for five hours. The plane did not show up for three hours due to 'weather grounding' which was totally false because the weather was fine in Houston even if there were thunderstorms it would not have grounded for three hours. Then we were boarded and the pilot mentioned they had technical issues. I still do not understand why they would board an entire plane before knowing if/how long it would take to repair everyone sat in the plane for two hours until they were finally able to fix and take off. We were told to contact United for 'compensation' due to the trouble and I was offered $50 (only because I have status otherwise it would have been $25) due to our inconvenience. Apparently a new policy just instituted to give you even less because in the past for something similar I received $100 and $150.

In the return flight at the airport they said the airplane is full so the forced us to put our handbags which contains all of our important things in luggage, and they did it again and send a (sorry sms) that the bag (which contains the car and home keys) will be delayed..

I was given emergency exit seat - being 6 foot 6 inches tall it was highly appreciated. The drink selection and quality of food is good - the best I have had on an airline. The plane was clean and bathrooms were well maintained. The service even in economy was of good quality and crew are professional and friendly. I will fly with Turkish again. The crew take pride in their job and go out of their way to accommodate. I enjoyed the blanket slippers and inflight entertainment.

As for the IFE - the variety of documentries was small. Transit in SVO from Terminal F to D took me 25 mins (and I walked fast). Too many shops on the way which made the walk harder.

American Airlines,1.0,Gary Davis,15th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Denver to Quito via Dallas/Ft. Worth. So we planned an awesome trip to the Galapagos and made the mistake of purchasing plane tickets to Quito Ecuador on American Airlines. I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning. I'm never flying on AA again and if you can avoid it you shouldn't either.",Airbus A319/320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Quito via Dallas/Ft. Worth,October 2017,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Cassandra Leen,14th April 2015,I was very disappointed with the service and overall experience I received from this airline I had a flight out of Fort Lauderdale Airport at 7.45 am I had arrived early around 6 am with my 4 month old infant. We boarded the flight on time everything seemed to be going as planned until the flight was delayed due to some electrical in the control panel. We ended up sitting on this flight for a good 2 hours waiting as they kept saying sorry and we will update you more in 5 minutes and then 30 minutes and overall a 2 hour wait time until they said we are sorry but we must all exit the plane and wait in line until we could get booked for another flight. Once booked for a new flight they gave us food vouchers the new flight they booked me on was at 2.55pm it was only 11am so I was expected to wait with an infant for another 3 hours - a long day waiting me with my son. I then received a notification on my phone that the flight they rebooked me on had been delayed 90 minutes which would have meant being stuck in Houston airport where my connecting flight was but that I would have missed by the time the new flight had arrived. I was then put on another flight leaving Fort Lauderdale at 5.15pm and arriving to my destination at 11.18pm.

For my flight on 9/26 I purchased ""Business Select"" (and paid more for it) for flight 426 so I could get priority boarding. When it came time to board the gate agent allowed everyone to board in whatever order they wanted regardless of their boarding number. I had A-1 but because the gate agent said people could board in whatever order people pushed past me to board first. I asked the gate agent what was going on and why we're not boarding in order. He said to just get on the plane. Once on the plane I asked the lead flight attendant what was going on and she said the flight was light so just take a seat. I contacted Southwest's customer service web page and filled out a complaint. I got a response from a ""no-reply"" email saying sorry but that they would do anything including not refunding the cost for the business select boarding they didn't deliver. My opinion of Southwest Airlines is they're unethical to charge you for something and not deliver, and then not even care.

Lufthansa,1.0,Mia Linder,18th November 2015,"Singapore to Karlstad via Frankfurt. I booked a Lufthansa business class ticket for my 81 year old mother who recently had a hip replacement operation. I specifically asked for handicap assistance which was confirmed weeks before departure. However, when my mother arrived in Frankfurt for transfer to Singapore, there was nobody to pick her up at the gate so she had to walk all the way to the next gate. For those who have been to Frankfurt airport you know that this can be a considerable distance. Upon her arrival in Singapore I called Lufthansa to file a complaint and was met with the instruction to do this via the website. I did that and got an automatic reply. Since then (now 14 days ago) I have heard nothing from Lufthansa. On her departure from Singapore I was guaranteed that my mother would have access to the business class lounge in Frankfurt on her transfer back to Karlstad as a compensation for their mistake on her outbound journey. (The thing is that there is no business class on the flight from Frankfurt to Karlstad so even though I booked a business class ticket I couldn't get any on that leg). On arrival in Frankfurt she was denied entry to the business class lounge and was put in a wheelchair in a corridor far away from the cafe to wait there for 2.5 hours.

The soonest they could get me on a flight was the next day with 2 (two) stops. I would miss my wedding so did not take it. My complaint is, when they cancelled the flight, only one employee was at the gate trying to reschedule everyone's flights. The American gate next to it, had 5 employees, talking, laughing, not doing anything. I went over to them and asked if they could help me. I had been in my line for 30 minutes and the employee had only gotten through 2 people! So you can imagine the anger of everyone in line! The 5 employees at the adjacent gate said they couldn't help and really didn't seem to care enough to walk over to our gate to help that 1 lone employee. I found that to be so incompetent for this or any airlines. Worst part for me was, my daughter was gong to the same wedding, also flew out from the same airport, same time, with JetBlue.

Missed out on preferred meal but only because I was right down the end. Food was the best I've had in a long time. Entertainment was great and the ability to order drinks from your screen is very handy. It also means no bells going off through the flight for service. Flight attendants were pretty average. Not great but not rude. I drank a lot of Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious and from New Zealand. All in all or was an average flight.

Air Canada,8.0,E Dean,10th March 2014,High Density 777-300 YYZ-YVR treated myself to an upgrade to Premium Economy and I must say I was extremely happy after seeing the cattle-car arrangement just behind me. PE is great! Seats are huge like domestic Executive Class on A320's A319's and A321's on AC but only if the upgrade is offered relatively cheap. My one complaint is that there should be a curtain divider between PE and economy and the cabin doesn't feel separated or intimate and noise and crowds spill over into PE. AC's new EnRoute system is a high upgrade over the old high-rez monitors much easier interface and improved maps. Seats are large leather arm-chairs same as Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic small footrest and small cocktail table in armrest. The economy 3-4-3 is just totally unacceptable to a North American consumer who are typically much larger than in other parts of the world. At baggage claim the complaints were loud people all around me talking of the horrid cramped conditions seats that don't breath and suffering passengers. AC get rid of this product it's horrid!!

Air Canada,3.0,R Mortara,25th September 2013,YVR-LHR. I decided to return to the UK direct rather than via Europe. Plus points: flight left on time and arrived early even with a short hold before landing. Also Air Canada has a 3x3x3 configuration on its 777-300s rather than the 3x4x3 used by many other airlines. Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless. 'Continental breakfast' comprised a small muffin and a small container of fruit - insufficient for a flight of 9 hours duration. The AVOD was ok with a wide choice available. I may well go to Canada again but will avoid Air Canada.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no

Alitalia,1.0,M Craciun,4th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Bucharest to Chicago via Rome. I do not recommend Alitalia and will never fly with this airline again. First, our luggage didnâ€™t make our connecting flight on our departing trip and we had to wait over 24 hours to get our baggage. We had to go buy clothes meanwhile, which was very inconvenient. Then, the return trip was a disaster. We flew from Bucarest to Rome, where we had a 2 hour layover. We were at the gate early and got in line with everyone else, when my husbands ticket was scanned it was refused by there system. They told us to go stand in another line and wait for the one guy helping with all the issues. After 10 minutes he said we were fine and to go back in the boarding line. They scanned his ticket again and it refused it. They said to go back to the other guy again. We proceeded to have to stand there for 20 minutes while everyone else was boarded and our plane was scheduled to leave and they couldnâ€™t figure out why the error was occurring. Have in mind we have a 1 year old child with us and she was getting very antsy. Finally they told us just to board because we were last. Our seats were not what we requested. We were told we had bulk head seats to accommodate our little girl but our seats were all the way in the back with NO leg room. We asked to be moved if possible and the stewarts refused to even try to help us. They said we need to sit and nothing is guaranteed. Next, when the plane went to take off it was coming off the ground and then slammed to a halt scaring the heck out of everyone. There was an instrumental problem with the plane and we had to end up sitting for 1.5 hours while it was fixed. Making it a crazy long 12 hour flight. The food is worse than other airlines and they expect you to get up and get your own beverages and crackers throughout the flight while they sit and sleep in their curtained area once they are done serving the dinner. I canâ€™t believe they are paid to sleep instead of help paying customers. Go around with drinks. Pick up trash throughout the flight. Anything. We were so disappointed with our experience with Alitalia. For a couple more hundred bucks, it is well worth flying with another airline. Especially if flying with children. Other airlines go out of their way to make everyone comfortable and content, especially on such a long flight. Alitalia employees could care less and many of their employees are super rude.

Qatar Airways,8.0,Rob Cooper,12th November 2015,"London to Singapore via Doha. Very impressed with the economy service and product offering on Qatar Airways on their brand new A380 and A350 aircraft. Aircraft spotlessly clean on both legs. Seating the same on both aircraft, very comfortable with good legroom and reasonable seat width. Felt more cramped on the A350. Crew professional and friendly on both legs. Good meal services on both flights, although I note on daylight flights in this case London to Doha the meal service and offering is much more extensive than on the early morning flights 0230am from Doha to Singapore. Inflight entertainment good and extensive choice not just of Western movies/tv but content from around the world. The Oryx IFE system they use is not that user friendly and can be clumsy. 15 minutes free wifi offered on both flights, but no point in using as the system times out constantly. Bathrooms kept clean throughout both flights. Only real negatives about experience, very long and drawn out safety announcements done in both Arabic and English but not simultaneously, way too much advertising of Qatar Airways, Qatar banks etc. Inflight entertainment interrupted too many times with charity videos and arrival videos for Doha.

Now if I know that why didn't the so-called professionals at AA know it? If they had asked me I could have told them the time allowed was insufficient anytime of year. There was no AA staff on the ground, only contract airport staff that had limited interest in passenger / customer satisfaction so the process took hours and with little or no regard for customer concerns or comfort. AA does not know when to quit abusing its customers - meaningless and cynical frequent flyers programs and now they ask you to buy miles when you check in - miles you used to be earning!

Their check-in had already closed we had to head back to customer service who after 20 minutes booked us on a flight at 2pm and gave us a couple of food vouchers. We then went to check in and were told we had to pay for our baggage-the flight cost nearly $700 each so why do I have to then pay $80 for baggage! Also told that if we wanted any food we had to pay for it even though it was included on our journey from Perth.

Emirates,4.0,S Cooper,28th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Emirates appear to be upgrading a lot of Economy passengers to Business. At check in the Business Class was only partially occupied on the Madrid-Dubai segment, indeed a few days before check in occupation was very sparse. On the day of travel it was almost full. So where did all the passengers suddenly appear from? I can only guess that they were upgrades, unless Emirates are bulk selling Business seats at lower prices through bucket shops. In either case, it seems extremely unfair on people like myself who have paid full price out of our own pocket, since the service for so many passengers is obviously not as good and why should I have to pay three times as much as my neighbour for the same seat? To add insult to injury, Madrid and Barcelona are Emirates' most expensive business class departures cities in Europe. Example Madrid Australia return is 5000 euros + from Madrid but less than 4000 euros from Paris or London.

Lufthansa,7.0,Gianluca Ratti,1st May 2015,Flew SFO-FRA on the A380. 11hr 20min in Y. Boarding at SFO was a mess because of some bad handling of their staff regarding priority boarding of disabled people that were flying with us. On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so. All in all a good experience: I find that atm what sets apart an airline with an another is their staff which I found really helpful kind and respectful. I would fly with them again.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes
United Airlines,1.0,J Armstrong,21st November 2015,"I called United to book a one way flight from LA to Dallas, but the person I spoke with could not speak English very well. After repeating, again and again the date of travel, this person finally managed to check the schedules and found a morning flight. I listened carefully, without interruption, to the flight times and flight numbers. United's agent said, ""OK, sir, I have you booked on flight XXX from LA to NY to Dallas. Can I have your credit card information please? I thought it strange that a United flight would travel across the USA to NY, turn aound and then fly to Dallas. I asked the agent if there was a more direct flight available and he replied, ""No."" I then said to the agent, ""Why is it necessary to fly first to NY and then to Dallas."" The agent replied, ""Sir, this is our schedule. A short lay over in NY and then to Dallas International."" Dallas International? I lived in Dallas for many years, and always knew the airport as DFW/Dallas Ft. Worth. Are you talking about Dulles International (not Dallas) in Washington, DC? The United agent replied, ""Yes sir, of course."" I said, ""No thanks,"" and hung up the phone. I was seconds away from giving this United agent my credit card information for an incorrect flight because of his inability to understand English. Last week I again telephoned United and was again connected to an agent with less than perfect English speaking ability. I hung up the phone. When I spend hundreds of dollars, if not thousands, on a particular product I become more cautious. And when I have trouble communicating with a vendor about such products because of a language issue, then I become wary and concerned that my questions and/or instructions will be either misunderstood or ignored. Find another vendor. United needs to understand that it's employees become their public image. And employees that cannot communicate properly will give the public a bad impression of United. United apparently does not understand that poor communication means poor customer service. And poor customer service always means a loss of business. Another issue is trust.

Aeromexico,1.0,Claude Baudoin,29th May 2011,A comedy of errors! Two days after the switchover to the SABRE reservation system check-in was still delayed a lot because they never trained their staff on the new system! My SAT-MEX flight left and arrived two hours late. There was no announcement of the cause for the delay. It took the agents about 10 minutes to check a passenger. As passengers finally trickled to the gate there was no agent and no sign confirming that this was an Aeromexico departure gate - and there was no plane. On the return May 29 things were still a bit slow that's when the agent told me that she had arrived at work on May 22 to find totally new screens on which she had received no training. The system also told them (on May 29) that I hadn't paid when in fact it was a prepaid Expedia ticket. Apparently they had changed the flight number right as they were switching systems and my reservation was not transferred correctly. After my flight boarded they announced that the co-pilot hadn't arrived! Hence a half-hour delay.

With that Jetblue announced the flight was cancelled (at 11:30 pm) and all passengers on our flight were to proceed to Gate XYZ, so we did.

We got to the hotel and waited in line again to get a room. We were told we would be taken to the airport at 1:30 to board our flight.

Air Canada,6.0,A Eric,10th March 2014,I am a Million Miler who flies business on long haul with AC. The angle pod seats were a great addition some time ago and provided business passengers with a feeling of value for money-true lay flats reasonable privacy etc. I cannot understand why AC would want to screw this all up with the new high density layouts in both business and economy-the business seats are resulting in mass complaints and mass desertions to other airlines. They downgraded their product to Hong Kong (in economy there are two or three fewer washrooms for 100 more passengers line ups a mile long the toilets are backing up as they are not designed for this volume of passengers. I have never in all my years heard more angry passengers than the Honk Kong to Vancouver AC passengers in any class. For a crass money grab on these routes AC is risking a big revenue loss to Japan airlines Cathay and other Asian airlines and on Europe runs to British Air and others even Lufthansa. This high density move is a complete disaster on the 777's and AC should reconsider. For those of us in the air a lot this change of equipment downgrade is a real choice maker.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,no

Emirates,5.0,G Whyte,31st May 2015,Flew to Perth stopping off in Dubai. Not overly impressed with Business Class Lounge in Heathrow a very limited breakfast. Boarded their new A380 and it was fabulous. I thought I was in First Class initially. Very comfortable and spacious seat and huge screen and many up to date films to watch. Very pleasant and efficient cabin crew who dispensed hot flannels (face cloths) regularly. The food was excellent and the bar at the back well words pass me. 18 year old Chivas Regal and top class nibbles (nuts and savoury biscuits). The entire flight was a singular joy and if you are using Emirates do try to upgrade if an A380 is the plane being used. Even the US pilot (he told us) seemed to have a purr of happiness to be flying this wonderful beast. So why the low assessments I hear you asking? Well it started going downhill after disembarking. Had to undergo another bag and body security check (not Emirates fault). Then the nightmare trying to find the gate for the second flight. I was given so much false information. Finally got to check in which was slow and ponderous and another bag and body security check. This time a Boeing 777. Oh! what a difference. It was old tired worn out and uncomfortable. The seat could lie flat but was very narrow preventing changing positions when sleeping. The television screen was significantly smaller too. The cabin crew were very friendly and pleasant and the food was good (just as well I like fish though). The difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777 was astounding. Come on Emirates do something about this.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,yes
Aegean Airlines,10.0,S James,31st July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Mytilene to London Heathrow via Athens return. As always, a pleasure to fly with Aegean. Cabin crew were very friendly, efficient and professional, plane was clean. Food was ok, it's not 5 star fine dining but much appreciated even on a 3.5 - 4 hr flight. Lovely wine. Landed early in ATH as is nearly always the case. ATH - MJT was a full flight and about 35 mins in the air with a drinks service followed by a breakfast snack service followed by coffee tea service (those cabin crew were constantly on the move and smiling). One thing that I'm not keen on is the pre allocated seating which is a pain especially if you want a specific seat (extra leg room, I'm 6' 6""). From LHR to ATH I logged on for check in as soon as it opened and there were only approx 13 other seats to select and from ATH to LHR approx 18 seats. Fortunately got an extra legroom seat on outbound but inbound had to ask an agent at the airport if a seat had become available. After a bit of tapping away she gave me extra legroom seats on both inbound flights (very appreciated). Please can we go back to selecting our own seats? Boarding is the usual chaos with no one taking any notice of the announcements (if they're boarding passengers seated at the back you can bet those with seats at the front will go through too) but it's no big deal and in no way reflects on the airline. Will definitely continue using Aegean when flying to Greece though",A320 / A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mytilene to London Heathrow via Athens,July 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,yes

Got to the gate the plane was there but would not let me on. Told me I would be able to get out the next day at 8:50 am. Asked for a supervisor and when he got there was extremely rude. I told him I would not stay the night and find me another flight. He did on American Airlines. Got into Orlando 2 hrs late. Flight home was just as bad. Get into Newark for connecting flight and was told I would be taking a bus by ground to Allentown. Almost a 2 hr bus ride cramped in a small bus once again not acceptable.

Emirates,3.0,Ron Thomas,21st April 2014,I'm a regular traveller albeit mainly short haul. When visiting friends I wanted to experience a flight on an Airbus 380 in Business. Big disappointment but waited to form an opinion until after the return flight. In my view there are just too many business class passengers to cabin crew and it is just not possible to get the level of service you expect from a business class flight. Significantly inferior to other aircraft configurations. Food quality was poor and you are left without being asked if you would like a glass of wine to go with your meal. By the time they arrive the meal is finished. I would recommend you avoid this if you want a high level experience. I usually try to fly via Doha with Qatar when going in this direction and will return to that route of travel in future.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,no

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Rossini Maitre,13th April 2014,I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed. They had no consideration for people's choice or diet preferences. You may get lucky but you may also dearly regret flying with them.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no

Boarding completed about 30 minutes late, we taxied for a while and then the pilot parked and turned off the engines, no communication for 20 minutes to explain what was happening. Waited 3.5 hours on the ground with almost no communication. The crew only came though the cabin two times during the 3.5 hour wait, once with water and once with crackers. Everyone was starving since they had been expecting to get lunch right after take off and was very aggravated by the lack of any service, not even a juice was offered. The kids lunch served (at 6pm) was 5 slices of potato cooked in ketchup with shrimp salad, terrible and neither kid could stomach it.

Our flight was empty because 80% of the passengers missed the flight. On our way back home, we left Cabo and arrived to Houston to connect to get to NYC. Once again Bs! The flight landed and we were on the tarmac for a while waiting for space. People were telling the flight attendants to make a announcement to let the people that have connecting flights off first. They made the announcement last minute, and it didnâ€™t help because once again everyone missed their flights. There was a long line to get a receipt for customs. Then we had to get our bags and recheck them. Houstonâ€™s airport needs a AirTran because we ran for miles just to reach our gate. Of course the flight left everyone behind. Thereâ€™s was only one flight leaving back to Newark. Only two people from my party of 8 was able to fly standby. 80 percent of our flight had to stay the night in Houston. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this before. I would rather fly with Spirit or Southwest! You get to the airport hours before and still miss your flight.

Emirates,6.0,C Baxter,17th March 2015,Dubai to Sydney Economy Class. After reading other postings here for Emirates just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see but a poor selection in English unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe.

American Airlines,6.0,M Thompson,17th November 2014,Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next.

As they only fly to the Gold Coast with narrow body aircraft there is no premium cabin and the best you can get is â€˜Works Deluxeâ€™. We had expiring Airpoints so decided to use them for this product. There is nothing deluxe about the economy experience. The meal was disgusting and not fit for human consumption. Not that they care. They just clear it away as though itâ€™s nothing out of the ordinary that the food remains untouched. Beverages are served in tiny plastic cups that you can drink in two mouthfuls and you are continually requesting refills (complimentary alcohol on this fare class). The IFE is pitiful in content. Two crew members were obliging the others made you feel it was beneath them to lower themselves to serve you. Based on the flight I can see why this airline makes record profits - the inflight offerings are pathetic and would cost them very little. Unfortunately Kiwis are blindly loyal to this over rated airline and therefore they continue to get away with a sub standard product.

Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience. United advertising is good unfortunately they only talk the talk. United has yet to learn how to walk the talk. United just frustrates me to no end.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,no

""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt."" I can't imagine anyone being able to sleep through the announcement. I was never able to fall asleep again during the flight. Can't United find a better way to alert passengers to the fasten seatbelt sign like a message on the television screen? Many United pilots turn on the fasten seatbelt sign when they need to use the toilet so it does come on a lot.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,T Barlin,20th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",A330 / A321,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul,February 2019,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,C Dale,24th February 2016,"So many issues with United. My 18 year old daughter booked a flight via United. This was her first solo flight. Her flight into ORD was an hour delayed for departure into SFO, which threw off all her connections. United's solution? To reroute her to Seattle and offer no hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers, so that she was forced to sleep in the airport from 1:15 am to 8am. They also made her check her bag in GSP, not because of size or weight, but because of her tight connecting flight in SFO (which she was unable to make due to the hour delay in ORD) So, all for $551, plus $25 bag fee, plus anxiety and stress for a first time, solo traveler. And to add even more insult, her bag won't even arrive when she does! She has to wait an entire day for her bag to arrive in RDM. We will wait to see how they respond, but given my part experience, it will probably be minimal - maybe a bag refund.

Comfort food, may not win the award but I bet customers would be happier. Then we went to use the AA entertainment system, however it appeared to not be operating.

I love the documentary on Soviet cars. The crew was smiling and I had a special very good Thai menu. I had a special luggage, a gun, as I compete internationally. The first good news is that Aeroflot includes it in the whole weight allowance contrary to many companies that charges extra fees up to 200 US dollars. I was advised at the plane door that my gun was on the plane to Moskow. In SVO also I was welcomed by an agent before the security check who took again the bag tag number to be sure that it will be on the plane to Zurich.

Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present.

I make an enormous effort not to fly any US carriers when I travel because the inflight experience is on average materially worse than virtually any other airline I know of. United however takes the cake as the worst. The reason I write this review is not because we were stranded overnight somewhere or held up on a tarmac for hours on end. I write this review because of the simple, every day occasions where United flight attendants and staff make flying unpleasant. On one flight, I sat with my sleeping daughter in my lap, call light on, for about 20 mins just to request a cup of water. I finally get the attention of a flight attendant, and she boldly waves me off and never comes to offer assistance. On my last flight, the flight attendant was so impolite at my request for 3 beverages between my daughter and me, I wondered if she was personally bearing the cost of the drinks. Today, I'm connecting through Chicago, and my minor daughter and I are not sitting together. At bag check in, they couldn't reseat me. And at the gate, I swear the steward took pleasure in not being able to do anything to reassign our seats. Instead of offering apologies, he blankly stared at me and repeated - word for word - a useless statement that I'd have to ask for assistance on board. Not only did this leave my 6 year old daughter crying, but after asking 4 people already, I'm to believe that the crew on board are going to do anything? It seems reasonable that United Airlines should be able to ensure children aren't flying alone",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jetblue Airways,3.0,Gabriela Fletcher,20th October 2018,"Not Verified | Salt Lake City to Raleigh-Durham via New York. I flew on standby on my most recent trip with Jetblue. I've flown standby many times and I am used to not always getting on the first time I go to the airport but this time was ridiculous. I attempted to leave on a Tuesday evening and at the very last second before the flight was closing its doors, I was told it was my lucky day and I got one of the last seats on the plane because someone didn't show up. I was printed a new ticket with my name and seat assignment, checked my carry on (since they ran out of overhead bin space), found my seat and buckled up. I sat there patiently waiting for take off when a stewardess/flight attendant came and told me the other person showed up and needed their seat back! They escorted me off the plane, gave me my bag back, and sent me on my way. They should not have been able to take me off the plane and give my seat away once they established the previous customer did not get the seat anymore and printed a new ticket with my name and that seat assignment. After three days of waiting on standby and being rolled over, I finally got a seat on a plane to JFK where I was supposed to connect to RDU and finally get home. When I arrived to JFK I found out the attendants that were rolling over my flight the previous days did not roll over my connecting flight each time like they should have (or at least they should have notified me I needed to talk to the proper people to get them rolled over) so I had to run all over the airport looking for someone who could help me get on the next flight out. Every person I dealt with that worked for Jetblue was rude to me, cut me off mid-sentence thinking they knew what i was asking before I could finish, or acted like I was at fault for not doing what I was supposed to (even though I was never notified of an issue and if I ever asked questions i was immediately cut off or rushed away so I didn't have to be dealt with). Jetblue treats their customers like second class citizens, even when they pay the full priced more expensive tickets like I have on previous occasions. On top of all this, I've also had luggage damaged when flying with them that they refused to take responsibility for. They have nice planes but the disappointing customer service and problems they have caused me when trying to travel have definitely turned me off of ever flying with them again!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Raleigh-Durham via New York,October 2018,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Deb Miller,12th May 2014,I wish I would have read the reviews for United before letting the travel agency book me on one of their flights. Twice we took off from Denver and both times we were re-routed back. The only information we got was a two second message from the pilot that we were going back. We were completely on our own to find out what we were supposed to do. None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question. After standing in the customer service line to re-book I was told no flights for two days. The customer service lady did seem to care and spent half an hour looking for alternatives. I heard all sorts of people complaining about this airline and our shuttle driver said she hears about them all the time.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,9.0,Louis Ho Nguyen,9th January 2014,SIN-NRT-SIN. Economy. Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Well they closed the gate in front of us and we missed the flight. Our next flight to Bydgoszcz was in two days.

After reservation was made and tickets were issued, airlines unexpectedly change our flight time, flight date and flight number, and this happened several times. It caused us having to change hotel and other reservations several times, and having to stay at some cities longer (or shorter). Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago. As for the flights themselves, they were ok. Service was ok, a bit inconsistent on some flights. Some planes were older, others are newer. Cabins and bathrooms were clean, seats were comfortable. Food were enjoyable, although quality was a little inconsistent too. In Turkey airports, you do get special privileges for flying with Turkish Airlines Business Class, so that is something to consider if flying to Turkey.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LAX to JNB via IST,December 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Southwest Airlines,3.0,Kathryn Grace,9th September 2018,Not Verified | We were flying from Atlanta to Milwaukee for my sister in laws wedding. Our flight was scheduled to stop in Baltimore then continue to Milwaukee. We hit a storm and understandably we were delayed. We had to stop in DC because we needed fuel and Baltimore was temporarily closed. Upon arriving at DC we were just waiting for fuel. That then turned into waiting over an hour for new pilots. During this entire time we were never notified of delay times or that the Milwaukee flight was cancelled. We finally arrived in Baltimore at 1 am and were told our flight was canceled and they rescheduled us for the morning. We went to a counter to get our boarding pass and to figure out overnight reservations. Southwest would not pay for the hotel accommodations and told us to sleep at the airport or pay for a hotel ourselves. They also couldnâ€™t even upgrade our boarding and we are stuck boarding very last. Overall very disappointed with how Southwest handled the situation. I understand you canâ€™t control the weather but there was zero communication once we were at DC airport.

When we got to Denver to change planes, the nightmare began. We were stranded.

We received text messages about every half hour with a new update. This took place for 7 hours and finally at 4pm, United cancelled the flight. Hours later we got an e-mail saying they booked us on a flight the next day, leaving us to miss our sonâ€™s graduation. So at that point, we might as well of gone home. Determined not to miss it, we booked a rental car and planned to drive all night to make it. Thankfully my wife found a flight on Southwest and we made it in time. Today I received an e-mail saying we would be receiving a $150.00 credit for each of us to use on a future flight, with United of course.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,4.0,Paul Beardshaw,10th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam. When an airline has so many lost luggage claims that after 45 days, your claim still hasn't been started, you have to ask yourself ""Is KLM the right airline to fly with?"". I have no complaint about the the planes, the staff or the on board experience, they're all pretty good. Where this airline fails is when they delay your flights because of missing catering, lose your luggage, smash that luggage and I lost some valuables. All of this happened to me in one flight. Trying to get their customer care team to acknowledge my claim and begin the investigation is proving to be more difficult than landing a vehicle on Mars. The day after I arrived back, my luggage arrived at my house and it was broken beyond repair, and missing several items. As I write this, it's been 45 days since I made first contact about this, and my claim is still sitting in a pile of claims, waiting to be started. Each time I call, my claim is being ""escalated to a manager"", only to find out the next time I call that this didn't happen. I've had every excuse available and not their staff hang up when I call. I have to use my colleague's mobiles so the support team does not recognise my number. If you are planning to book with KLM, only do so if you are only taking hand luggage with you, and you're prepared never to make a claim against the airline for anything else because, it's highly unlikely they will process your claim.

Emirates,1.0,A Danal,22nd October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Tom Payne,22nd November 2015,"Chicago to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. This was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance. I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people. I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers. I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul. But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it. The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will. It is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service.",,Business,Business Class,ORD to DUS via IST,November 2015,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later.

United Airlines,1.0,L Singleton,28th January 2015,Never again will my family and I fly with United Airlines! We flew in from Sacramento to San Fran and we missed the connecting flight to Hawaii because of their delays. We had to wait 2 hours then fly up to Seattle and then to Hawaii which made a 5 hour flight over 6 hours! On the way back from Hawaii we had a flight connecting us from LAX to Sacramento but missed it once more because we were sitting on the Tarmac for 40 minutes doing nothing. There were no more flights to SAC so we had to spend the night in LA. My husband 2 sons and I are now missing work and my 2 other children are missing school. Missing the flight once was bad enough but a second one is totally unacceptable. Both times the planes we needed to get on were sitting there and we were only late by minutes and they wouldn't let us on. We missed a whole day in Hawaii because of it.

I ordered a Coke for my son and it never came so I asked a flight attendant she never came back with it then it was I guess 45 min. before landing and another attendant came around and when asked she said I need to order it on the screen and the ordering time was up I told her I ordered it on the screen over an hour ago and she acted like she didn't believe me so she checked my screen then went and got the drink. When going back home to Ft. Laud the ticket counter girl in LA was rude didn't tell us what gate to go to then the flight attendants were very rude - again as if they were annoyed to be there and the remote controls and TV screens were sticky and filthy. The good thing is that the pilot got us there and back on time as scheduled and it was a non-stop flight.

Come to find out, my new flight is not in first class even though I paid for first class. So, I contacted the airline thinking it was a mistake. The first time I called I spoke with a lady who did not provide her name. She bluntly told me ""Due to the delay in Knoxville your flight was cancelled and you wont be in first class"". I told her that was unacceptable and I was mad, at that point she hung up on me. I called back, was hung up on again! I called back extremely upset by this point and got a gentlemen who told the same thing the first lady told me and that the only way the airline would consider giving me a refund was to file a claim with the airline.

Arrived at Columbia early to try and get another flight because I knew weather was bad today and it was going to be bad across the country. Even though the plane had 8+ seats on both legs to Cleveland I was refused standby and was not allowed to purchase a ticket. You lost an additional sale - someone needs some more training. So, as I guessed original flight from CAE is delayed. When the aircraft arrives, absolutely no hustle by anyone to get the plane boarded. I will give props to the pilot - was ready to push off immediately and made up some time in the air. Land in Washington and have to wait for the ground crew to move equipment out of the way. Really? How does this happen when we were due in 30 minutes ago? We have to wait for all luggage to be pulled and the wait for the bus driver to take us to the terminal. No attempts made to speed anything up. Finally make it to the terminal about 2 minutes late, and no effort is made to route another bus to the plane even though there were 15+ minutes until scheduled take off. I asked to check on other flights and he said he couldn't help me as he stares at his computer in front of him. I eventually make it onto another delayed flight after finding someone with some empathy. When you know all of you're flights are late, make an effort to care and try to be prepared and efficient. And it would be nice to hold flights for a few minutes when you know connecting flights are on the ground, but that's understandable not to hold them. 2 points for the pilot.

The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling.

American Airlines,1.0,T Barden,19th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Our flight this evening was delayed 4 times over 3 hours due to bad weather in Chicago. At 9pm we were informed that our flight had been rescheduled for 9:30am the next morning. I understand you can't control the weather, but by this time there were no other flights leaving Raleigh (or the surrounding area) until at least 7am the next morning. I had an important event to attend in Chicago the next morning. When I approached the agent you could tell right away that she didn't care. I tried to find an earlier flight from a nearby area or even just one that got me close to Illinois. I offered to drive from Raleigh part way to catch a flight or even drive from outside Chicago a couple hours...if she could just get me close. The response I received was that my request was too difficult and required too much work on her part. I then asked if there was someone else who could help me and she said I was free to go wait in line again for someone else who might be more willing to spend the time assisting me in getting to my destination. (point to note: there was no one behind me in line) I was frustrated and started to break down into tears (that's how important this event was) but all she did was pick at her nail polish and repeat the phrase 'you will not be making it to Chicago by tomorrow morning.' She then proceeded to tell me that I was not eligible for a hotel voucher because I was not based out of Raleigh? Well played. I travel a decent amount and have a lot of patience for people dealing with travel issues. Travel delays happen and I accommodate, but this time I really needed to get somewhere and American Airlines missed the mark. The least she could have done is shown a little compassion but no, I was treated like I was there to serve her needs as she saw fit. Would it have been so hard for her to ask someone else to help me? Apparently the purchase of a ticket from American Airlines doesn't include basic kindness for the ticket holder. Maybe you have to pay extra for that?",,Business,Economy Class,Raleigh to Chicago,June 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,3.0,N Beale,8th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Savannah to Dallas. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hrs early to get checked in. I travelled with my 80 year old mother who lives in a different state than me, and who does not know how to use the kiosk. There were 3 ladies behind the check in counter huddled up talking and giggling like school girls. We stepped to the counter and asked to be checked in. A rude woman said, did you try the kiosks?! I stated, ""No. My mother is 80 years old and does not know how to use them, so we would like to check in here"". She gave us a bad attitude while her friends still stood there doing nothing to help other passengers, by maybe calling them over to their empty check in stations. There used to be something we called ""customer service"". Apparently, American Airlines would rather pay staff to stand around and *watch customers use the kiosk*, rather than offer assistance to elderly passengers, who remember the days of checking in at the counter with a live friendly agent, not an robot?! I was furious my mother was treated this way. To top it off, they also put us in separate seating rows at checkin, yet when I booked our tickets, I had chosen seats together online. I had to have another agent at the gate correct the seating arrangement, where we were then sat in the very back row against the toilet walls where seats did not recline, not the prechosen seats we paid for and were ticketed to sit in on our reservations.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Dallas,April 2019,1.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,no

Air Canada,2.0,T Eldem,14th July 2015,"As a top tier AC frequent flyer I checked in using the priority lane. The agent was aloof. We had an onward connection with Lufthansa and despite providing her with booking reference and ticket numbers, she insisted there was nothing she could do to issue our boarding passes, so much for seamless integration with Star Alliance. On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection. AC lost its title as Best North American carrier and I hope this serves as a warning to them as their service and especially staff interactions have put them on par with the rest of the mainstream carriers in North America.

Emirates,6.0,P Warden,6th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Durban to Athens via Dubai. Emirates standards have dropped considerably. They donâ€™t even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they donâ€™t have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didnâ€™t offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs. I have for many years regarded Emirates as the worlds best airline, but after experiencing these cost cutting measures, I will gladly forfeit my skywards miles and go back to Qatar or Etihad.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Durban to Athens via Dubai,July 2018,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no

Emirates,7.0,T Mele,26th August 2016,"Milan Malpensa to New York JFK with Emirates. The A380 is a beautiful plane, and the version that Emirates has outfitted is a little to flashy for my taste, fake wood and gold trim. The seats are great, lie flat with direct aisle access, the ICE inflight entertainment has a mind boggling array of movies and shows from every corner of the planet. Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back. The food was good, not great, I've had just as good food on domestic USA first class, although not as plentiful as I received on Emirates. A couple of glitches. The FA's completely forgot to serve me my main course, I had to ask after everyone was served. Very apologetic and kind apology from the FA. Next I wasn't served my dessert, I was dozing, that was OK. However I was offered a choice of desserts and the wrong one was brought to me. I expected a little more polish.

American Airlines,7.0,B Michaels,9th January 2014,Flew Business Class from Santiago Chile to Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777. I fly First and Business Class on airlines around the world and I don't have a problem at all with these Biz Class seats and amenities. Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special. AA service levels are average at best and can't come close to what is offered with the international airlines. The Admirals Club in Santiago was crowded and food selection poor.

Onboard it was the standard Lufthansa short haul business cabin, with middle seat left empty. Breakfast was a cold plate choice and warm rolls offered, all of good standard.

United Airlines,2.0,McGuire Jack,1st May 2014,MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it. In one generation United has gone from industry standard to mediocre to absolute lowest common denominator.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,B Nasanov,2nd April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Newark to Dublin. Most unfriendly staff ever. We are a family of 3 flying with a 3 year old, the flight is early in the morning, so we had toddler, who was sleep deprived and we had separate seats with my husband. We asked at the gate to help us to seat together, explaining that itâ€™s easier to handle our son together, but nobody bothered, basically, we were told, thatâ€™s our issue. In the plane my son has tantrum with crying, we tried to talk to other passengers, asking if there is a way to switch, no luck. Flight attendants just pass by saying â€œYou are his mom, deal with itâ€, threatening to stop the plane taking off if I couldnâ€™t have him seated. My explanation that I need at least my husbandâ€™s help or the window seat (preferably the second) are ignored. Finally, there is one very nice flight attendant (the only one who seems to care about passengers) who was able to switch us to the window seats, we calmed down our son and he fell asleep. Other flight attendants gave us really bad attitude, as if being a parent means to have a magic wand that will make a 3-year old behave like an adult and quietly sit through the 7-hour flight. In addition, there was no child meal that I ordered, and he refused to eat whatever they offered for adults (the food looked awful), so he had only muffin and a couple of cookies during the entire flight.

American Airlines,1.0,Niccole Liriano,6th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flying with American Airlines from Miami to La Guardia, New York has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had traveling. The staff are rude and uneducated and they have many staff members who only speak one language (which makes it really difficult to communicate). I arrived late to my flight in Miami because I was on a previous flight that we missed due to bad weather. When I get to Miami I had about an hour to get everything done but with the lack of education and common sense from the staff members at American Airlines I was cut short on time. First off in my previous flight I was given a standby ticket for this flight because we were not going to make it to our original flight. When I get to Miami and tried explaining that to the staff member in bag check in she told me ""keep your mouth shut and give me your ticket"". She then tells me I'm too late to check in my bags so I decide not to go with bags. The women gave me back my stand by ticket instead of boarding pass which did not allow me to go to TSA. I then had to go back in the line to get a boarding pass. Finally got a boarding pass and TSA were excellent and let us go ahead of everyone so we could make the flight. When I get to the gate the ""manager"" told me I was not able to get on board because the doors were closed. It was 8.20 and the flight got delayed to 8.40. If I'm not mistaken you can board up to 10 minutes prior to flying. She refused to let us on and decided that her best customer service skill was to scream at us.

American Airlines,1.0,Dakoda Thomas,16th March 2019,"Not Verified | Alabama to New York. The only reliable thing about this airline is that it consistently fails to get its passengers to the agreed location on time. Iâ€™ve flown with American Airlines 3 times over the last year and every time something causes a failure on the airlines part to get me to the destination I payed to travel. Also I bought a family members ticket and today they failed to get them to the local airport and Iâ€™m having to drive hours to get them. Itâ€™s been blamed on the weather, mechanical issues, even bad luck by the airline but in reality this airline is terrible. I tried calling and asking for some sort of reimbursement but the said I would have to email the airline and provide tons of documentation instead of a representative helping me after the airlines failed on 4 different occasions. This airline is absolutely horrible and I hope people read this and go to another airline because thereâ€™s a high probability this airline will fail you!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Alabama to New York,March 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,9.0,K Kelley,6th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Cairo to Doha on a 777-300. Flew with my daughter so had two seats at the windows. Very spacious and comfortable. Nice set-up if traveling with someone. Outstanding service by the flight crew and food as usual. Used the Le Meridien airport hotel for an overnight stay at each end and very satisfied with it. The only major issue with Cairo airport is the lack of transport between terminals - always an adventure. Went through about half a dozen security check points throughout the airport - most I've ever experienced. Everyone at the airport willing to help and friendly. Departed Cairo a bit late even though the airport was pretty ""dead"". Return trip was on an A330-300. Not a good experience compared to the other Qatar Airways aircraft I've flown on (A320, A321, A350, 787, 380). Very cramped and no storage space. Will not use their A330 service again.

Qatar Airways,9.0,Mark McCullough,4th January 2016,"Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow via Doha. I arrived at Tokyo Haneda 6 hours prior to departure due to a domestic flight, but I couldn't check my bags in until 2 hours prior. Japan Airlines handle Qatar Airways at HND, and their check in desks are always open, so I don't know why they can't take their partners bags early. It was also disappointing that Premium Class pax can't use the fast rack security lanes here. But you do get access to Japan Airlines First/Premium Sakura lounge, which has all the facilities you need. Boeing 787 left a few mins late, and once airborne I was asleep on the very comfortable lie flat seat. When I woke up I dined (on demand) on good quality Japanese and Western food, and then rested for the rest of this 12 hour sector. Transfer at DOH was slightly less chaotic than outbound, but it is noticeable that the volume of transfer pax has not been well planned for and security is somewhat lax to get pax through quickly. Signage in DOH is poor, and I struggled to find my way to the Business lounge. Boarding the A380 was a treat (my first time) - we were warmly welcomed by a charming FA who took our coats and offered us a drink. I cannot believe how quiet the A380 is, especially on take-off. We had a great flight, enjoying the lounge bar for a cocktail before lunch, having a nap in the great seats (same as 787) and watching the IFE, A top class journey!

I was placed on a flight that was four hours later than my original flight. All other flights were full so I had to enjoy my six hour visit at the airport. My complaint is for this reason only, other airlines I fly give you email updates when a flight is delayed or cancelled.

I was told I would get some sort of compensation but I registered on the website to check and I got nothing. Very disappointing, but at least they didn't leave my suitcase a complete mess. The flight itself was ok. If it weren't for the luggage issue I'd probably have more positive things to say but I feel like I got royally screwed over.

United Airlines,2.0,B Mears,23rd March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manila to Colorado Springs via Guam / Honolulu. Worst flights I have ever experienced. Flight to Guam, we were seated and asked the flight attendant if he could put my wife's purse in bin above us, he gave me a dirty look and shut the bin. I asked him again and he finally took it acting as if it was an issue for him. The flight from Honolulu to Denver was horrible, the seats are too narrow. When we boarded we were in 17D and 17E. When I went to put my one carry on bag in the bins above my seat they were full, and the flight attendant gave me a dirty look and said to put it in a bin behind me. This meant I had to put it about 7 rows behind me. The result was when we landed, I had to wait for everyone to leave plane before I got to get my carry on. The reason the bin above me was full was the flight attendant allowed the couple to our left to use two bins for their carry on baggage. When I pay for a ticket I expect to be able to stow at least one carry on above me in the bin. My opinion was the flight attendant could not care less. The other problem is the seats are about 17"" wide and have little recline. I think the management at United needs to try flying and sitting in one of these seats for a 7 hour flight and see how they like it. Overall the service and seating was horrible. If you fly to Asia, I would recommend JAL or ANA as they have great seats and service, plus they provide an excellent meal.",Boeing 777-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Colorado Springs via Guam / Honolulu,March 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Gilbert Kujovich,29th November 2015,"My wife and I booked flights from Dulles Airport to Addis Ababa via Frankfort and then returning through Paris with a layover of 6 days in Paris. The incompetence of United Airlines was evident from the outset - although we made our reservations at the same time to travel together, my wife and I were given separate confirmation numbers, which complicated any later transactions. We were told that our travel included 2 bags each with no charge, but we were charged for our second bags on each leg of the journey. Our flight from Addis Ababa to Paris was on the night of November 13, the night of the terrorist attacks in Paris. We attempted to change our date of flight to Paris, which was on United's partner Ethiopian Airlines. After 5 hours with a person in the US talking to United and a person in Ethiopia talking to Ethiopian Airlines, and after being told by each that any change had to be made through the other, we gave up on trying to make the change and instead purchased new tickets that ultimately brought us back through Frankfurt rather than Paris. United Airlines refused to refund the unused portion of our original tickets and even though we paid in full for the unused tickets, we cannot even get the miles added to our mileage plus accounts. In short, United Airlines has taken our money, was able to sell the seats again if there was a demand, and won't even award miles for the thousands we paid for the unused tickets. Even the email response to my refund request demonstrated the incompetence of United's employees, telling me ""Upon our investigation, the partially used ticket does not eligible to our Exception Policy",,,,,,,,,,,,

United Airlines,2.0,Deanna Quattro,14th October 2015,"After years of collecting credit card points we decided to use them to fly first class from Toronto to Hawaii and back. We had to go with what was provided. The first flight from Toronto to Los Angeles was in first class on Air Canada. We had a ""pod"" type seat which reclined flat. We were provided with comfortable pillows and a comforter. We had our own individual screen and could watch movies, tv, etc. The food was great and service equally as good. It was everything we had imagined first class would be. We had the same first class treatment from Los Angeles back to Toronto. The polar opposite is true of our United Airlines portion from Los Angeles to Hawaii. The plane is old and first class only means wider seats that recline slightly more than economy with more leg room but extremely uncomfortable to try and sleep in. Besides the food, the only extra we got was a paper thin blanket - no pillows, no screens, no music, nothing. You have to download the app if you want to watch something or listen to music. What if you don't have a smart phone or don't want to watch a movie on it? The flight to Hawaii was bad enough but unfortunately we were stuck with United Airlines on the overnight flight from Hawaii back to Los Angeles and hardly slept a wink. Ironically before we left home, I decided to leave my neck pillow at home. Why bring it - we were flying first class. Big mistake. United's definition of ""first class"" is no class. I regret wasting the points I took so long to collect on the United Airlines flights. I will never knowingly fly United again.

Emirates,5.0,Dick Sims,7th November 2015,"Sydney to Bangkok with Emirates. I was unhappy with the Check-In staff member who mistakenly added the weight of my carry-on cabin bag to my Checked luggage, requiring me to repack my bags, but when I eventually got back to (different) check-in desk my checked luggage was well under the 30kgs allowed, so I ended up checking both bags and carrying the plastic bag that I was going to post as my carry-on. The difference between the two service staff was marked - this is the second time this has happened. The meals on Emirates in Economy have deteriorated in the last year or so, probably because Emirates operates a codeshare arrangement with Qantas on this route, so they are maybe catering to Qantas customers. The cabin staff are very professional and helpful, The beer on board is supermarket class offering a Dutch and USA option with a Dutch light alternative rather than options from Oceania or Asia which I would prefer, still the staff offer options rather than just what is close to hand. The wine is quite reasonable given it is cool and drunk at altitude. The in-flight entertainment is superior unless the person in front insists on fully reclining their seat even during meals which makes viewing the screen extremely unpleasant, but this is probably more a reflection on the type of passenger Emirates attracts with their code share arrangement with Qantas than on the actual seat.",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Bangkok,July 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Gordon Matthews,9th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew from London to Miami via British Airways which was a superb flight. Then I had a connection from Miami to Montevideo using American Airlines. The difference between these 2 experiences was staggering. When I finally cleared imigration in Miami (although I was in transit) which took over 2 hours I went to the business class lounge the staff were pleasant and the lounge not too bad but the food was minimal and not up to business class standard and I was given a voucher for 2 drinks. I use lounges all over the world and this is the first one I have ever used that expected you to pay for your drinks. I don't think American Airlines have any idea what business class passengers expect and I doubt if they care. We then went to the gate although they don't give you any information when you should go. When we arrived at the gate we had our boarding passes that had been issued in London (I was travelling with my brother) I went through fine but they stopped my brother and told him they had changed his seat. I asked the incompetent at the gate why? No apology in any form I was just told it was nothing to do with him and he couldn't do anything. I asked for the purser once on board and these 2 women turned up one was the purser and one was ground crew when we explained that we were not happy that this had happened they again gave no apology and said they it wasn't to do with them and what did they expect me to do throw people out of their seats? (ironic as this is just what they did to us). When we pointed out that there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen the purser got defensive and threatened to have us thrown off the aircraft. Just bullying us. All the time this was happening this was stood up in front of all the passengers a very unpleasant experience and dreadful customer service. The plane was tired, narrow seats that when you tried to lie down you felt that you were in a coffin, no built in entertainment centre, I didn't eat dinner but had breakfast which was appalling. All the crew were wearing different clothes so they had no attention to detail and no uniform in the true sense of the word.This is the worst airline I have ever flown.

United Airlines,1.0,Brian Connery,1st July 2015,"Flew out of HNL to SFO on a tired Boeing 777-200 with no seatback videos. The boarding is similar to Southwest as you line up in group numbers. The problem is that we paid for an economy plus seat and still had to wait at the end to board. The flight crew was average but what upset me was that a poor woman with limited English asked the flight attendant for some water so she could take medication before take off. She was pointing at what she needed in the galley and the flight attendant screamed at her and threatened her with disembarkation. For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable. After a four hour stopover we boarded again with the same procedure. Once we got on our way the flight attendants provided their usual sub standard service. However, as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted. The flight attendants in first class made sure that the economy passengers stayed in their section. All I can say is that flying domestically is more or less not worth it. Luckily, majority of my trip including two flights on Air New Zealand who treated their passengers with respect and were not afraid to offer complimentary food and drinks. It is sad that Continental Airlines got eaten up by United.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,1.0,E Saliker,1st December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to Munich via Amsterdam. I am really disappointed about yesterdays behaviour of KLM. I was supposed to fly out from Singapore at 1:30 on December 1st. On November 30st around 7pm, so just a few hours before the flight I checked my e-mail (I was lucky because I checked them already a few hours before and didnâ€™t see any KLM e-mail) and saw a mail by KLM saying that my flight has been cancelled and that I have been booked on a flight at 1.35pm on December 1st! So what? Is this even legal? My husband (booked on the same flight) called KLM and because we had to be home within noon on December 1st, they booked us on a Emirates flight via Dubai on 9pm on November 30st. We almost didnâ€™t make it to the check in, couldnâ€™t get seats next to each other anymore. So how is this working: they just send a mail, hoping people are just accepting the change? How about plans, unbooked hotels etc - if I hadnâ€™t checked my mails, where we supposed to sleep on the airport? How about plans when getting home? This is completely unprofessional and unacceptable!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Munich via Amsterdam,November 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no
Jetblue Airways,1.0,Allen Miller,10th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York JFK to Los Angeles, Whereas I've often seen that when a couple of family comes aboard separated they will sit together and when someone comes who has the seat they all work it out - with my volume of travel, and my teams', we're often those people who switch our seat, here's how JetBlue made this mess. There were no adjacent tickets available for purchase when we bought the tix so we ended up with two mint window seats and two aisle seats, each set on opposite sides of the aisle, my 11 year old son sat on his own but of course we couldn't leave my 7 year old little girl sitting alone by a window seat while my wife sat on the other side of the aisle without even full view of my daughter and have some stranger sit next to my little girl. So my wife sat next to my little girl until we could talk to the person in that seat - who we assumed would be reasonable like the rest of us. Then one of the gate staff came in and told my wife she had to move, leave my 7 year old little girl who still carries her pink blanket with her alone. I went up and told them there was no way we were leaving our little girl alone in that seat, wait for some stranger to sit there and hope the airline could work it out. The guy across the aisle was sweet amidst what was becoming a tense situation and offered to trade, which was great. I then went up to tell the pilot, stewardess and offending gate person that I was going to issue a formal complaint and rather than simply apologizing or even just saying something like ""I understand of course, go ahead"" he threatened to have our family wait for the next flight if I complained. I was speechless and since my wife and my daughter were now sitting together safely I let it go. Do they train these airline people on customer service and service recovery at all?

Flight delayed from GOT due to bad weather in IST. Middle seat turned down but otherwise standard economy seat and no IFE. Food ok. Arrived late and got a hotel night free of charge at IST since the flight to DAC was next day. Lounge at IST is wonderful and I really felt relaxed before boarding tk 713 to DAC. Old plane poor IFE poor service. The lights in the cabin were blinking all the flight and I was worried someone would get an epilepsy attack. no lie flat seat felt like a plane from the mid-90's. All in all not a pleasant business class experience. Flight back tk 714 on leased 330-200 this time a newer plane good service lie flat also a leased plane from jet airways.

I flown with a dozen or so airlines over the years, and never have I encountered the level of a incompetence and indifference than from the staff of Delta. Not only did the plane arrive 30 minutes late but the stewardesses for the flight arrived an hour past when the flight was scheduled because they were both on separate flights that were also late somehow. Why would you schedule staff to work on one plane when there still in the air working on other plane? This is ridiculous! And this was on a clear summer day, not a winter blizzard. Also, while trying to exchange my tickets weeks in advance because my travel dates changed they resorted to outright extortion. They said they would it cost me $200 per ticket to exchange them for flights that were selling from their own website for $106 each. When I told them that I could just buy new tickets for almost half the price of exchanging them they then told me that they would void my return ticket even though I wasn't trying to chang the return trip. Delta's service is far worse that even the cheapest of the budget airlines.

Having never flown with Qatar (normally a Singapore customer) I was tempted by the price and time saved by flying through the Middle East. Can't really fault the experience too much and would recommend them. The PER-DOH flight was a 777 and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and space - felt very relaxed. Entertainment was good too with plenty of films etc. The new Dreamliner flight from DOH-LHR was nearly as good but definitely more cramped. Knees pressing against seat in front. Those IFE boxes have a lot to answer for especially on aisle seats - feet space is minimal. Luckily for me on all 4 flights I had no one sitting next to me so could stretch out. May have been lower score if flight was full. Food and service on all flights was as good as it gets although return trip to Perth was a bit lacking as they were tight with offering up water.

The long haul from DUS to JFK, the waiting area in DUS was rather small even for a medium sized airplane like the A340-400. The boarding was very professional and smooth. My boys wanted to have aisle seats, thats what we got. Lufthansa has a very good special meal programe free of charge, which if you order ahead, gives you the opportunity to chose between 20 diffrent mealtypes. I chose indian vegetarian.

The food was very good nicely presented and tasty. Cabin attendants were professional in all flights nothing to complain about. Seats are ok for a couple of hours flights with the overhead screens and consequently limited entertainment. I have three observations for improvement: 1) The Business lounge in Sabina airport is very unpleasant a box size room with no edible food available. 2) The Ataturk airport (I had it for return flight) was extremely busy and flights are usually delayed for 30-45 minutes. 3) I observed that the light in cabins during the boarding catering (almost two hours) and landing was extremely bright (it is annoying when there is late evening or night flight).

Southwest Airlines,3.0,S Burton,26th September 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Denver to Phoenix. Delays and incompetent staff. Southwest could benefit from teaching all of their employees to take responsibility regardless of whoâ€™s job certain things actually are. For example. I entered the airport with an 18 month old. I asked the woman checking us in if I could check the car seat at that time she said no and to check it at the gate. At this time it would have been nice if she had mentioned the baby needed a boarding pass. Since he was a lap child I did not know that he needed a boarding pass until I got to the gate to board. I then had to get out of the line to get the babies boarding pass printed. Is it a huge deal no but the customer service industry needs to anticipate and serve the customer. This just leads me to believe they donâ€™t care about customer service. While I was dealing with this issue the ladies printing the boarding pass pointed out out how that was someone elseâ€™s job. After I got the boarding pass I went to board the plane and gave my car seat. I was then told it needed a tag and I was asked why I didnâ€™t get a tag as I was getting the babyâ€™s boarding pass. As if it were my fault. The customer service is just poor.

Transfer in YYZ was easy and good and shortly after boarding the CRJ for Nashville the plane was grounded for technical issues.

However, because the day was such a disaster, I would love to add extra vilification. The day started off with a casual 4:00 wake up call since security is especially hard being in a family of 10. But, looking back, that was the only part of my day that went right at all. After arriving at the gate on time for our 6:30 AM flight, the airline promptly updated the online southwest app of an hour delay but did not inform any of us in person. An hour later, the crew announced that there were difficulties with an essential radio in the cabin. Regardless, we were all lined up and loaded into the plane anyway. But the plane never took off. Four more hours later, we waited for them to call out all of our names as a role call. However, they still pulled us all off, lined us up, and started it all over again. That flight had no further problems, but we missed both of the connecting flights. Only due to several miracle cancellations were we even able to get the two more flights to Amarillo. The second flight was from 5-6, and, aside from a couple hour layover, proceeded as planned. The third flight was scheduled, at first, to be from 10:00-11:00 PM. Then it was delayed one hour, again with the gate not informing us of the reason for or the hindrance itself. Then it was delayed another half hour. Then another.

The flight was smooth, seat was comfortable, food was bland but palatable. However, the flight was anything but uneventful. Just before beginning descent into Moscow Sheremyetevo, a woman walking down the aisle to the bathroom approaching me appeared faint and collapsed. I and a couple other passengers kept the woman from falling hard and lowered her to the floor. This was when the flight attendants jumped into action. The head attendant coordinated the staff, helping care for the woman. They asked for a doctor on the plane and fortunately there was one. The woman appeared to be having a diabetic episode, and the doctor attended to the distressed woman in the seat behind me, assisted by the flight attendants. All during the incident, the flight attendants were calm and professional. They did an excellent job of managing the situation, especially during landing and deboarding of the aircraft, managing the arrival of medical crews to assist the woman, while at the same time ensuring the safety of the passengers. I was very impressed with the ladies of Aeroflot!",Boeing 737-800,Business,Economy Class,Tyumen to Moscow,February 2018,3.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,4.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Teri Wedel,3rd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Nashville to Reno. Worst experience ever! Flight was delayed for 1.5hr waiting for clearance. Which happens, I guess. But when we landed no luggage. We were informed that our luggage was on another plane & would not arrive until 3pm. We arrived at 11:30am. We were told that our two luggage would be delivered to the home that we are visiting. They said it would go out for delivery at 5:30pm & we could expect it no later than 9:30 pm & if it was not delivered by 10pm to call back. We went & ate & killed time & call back at 4:30pm asking if it was there yet & could be just come & pick it up. We were told No because everyone had already left for the day in baggage claim. By 10:15 no luggage so we called & they said it was still there & we could expect it in the morning.

Southwest Airlines,8.0,Jim O'Malley,11th May 2015,I guess some people on this board either don't travel much or don't do their homework. I have traveled quite a bit over the last many years I don't do much anymore but when I do I at least check things out. Many seem to be surprised at SW boarding procedures can't say I love it but at least I understand it. I paid the twelve dollars for a seating upgrade got A-37 out and A-43 back. Got on with plenty of seats and overhead space. If you don't like the charge go on another airline and pay $30+ to check your bag. The trip was fine but airline travel anymore is like bus travel used to be don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed or pay 5 times as much and go first class on another airline. I'm no spring chicken 70 years old and the seats are not great but again it's a bus not an airliner. I did fine would fly SW again if they had the best price and routing I always check around. All I can say is they got me there on time and that's what I paid for.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,,,,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Ross Strachan,6th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Tucson to Ottawa via Newark. Although the aircraft is relatively new, the sardine layout makes it feel very cramped. At the end, it took 15-20 min for the exiting line to reach rows 32-34. It is that difficult to exit as the middle and window seats are unable to get ready at all. More annoying however, the 3-4 hr flights are without infotainment, except the one you pay via WIFI. Considering that UA dropped me and many others, on connecting flights that commence boarding 5-10 minutes before landing, it is obvious that you have no time whatsoever to charge devices - not if going from UA to UA flight. Besides the lack of USB or any other ports, they want you to download their own apps and software, and hopefully be sucked into an UA wifi spending spree. Food? What food? There was water at some point. Given the narrow lane and 3x3, yes it took 60 min for the water cart to make it midway.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to EWR,August 2016,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,I Ishak,7th March 2014,It has taken me in excess of an hour to resolve what should be a simple matter on the phone with their customer service flights are always late (which I understand is not always the airline's fault but most of my late flights result from insufficient crew which they can do something about). The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children! Not to mention that they ran out of food. I already had low expectations for them but I did not expect to bring my own food to first class. Avoid at all costs.,,,First Class,,,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,no

Routing and timing brilliant - 24 hours with only one layover for a route that can be easily 36 hours. (Europe-NZ). 3 of the 4 departures were delayed, one would have blown my outgoing flight but Qatar had made my incoming flight earlier, just in case. At least one delay may have been due to heightened airport security at Tegel. Luggage all arrived okay. Food not exceptional. AV system- good selection, could not search movies by name. On the first flight, it was the previous month's selection - latest movies were not yet uploaded. On the last big sector the handset was broken and the touch screen had an intermittent fault and USB port was no-go so I could not charge my phone. Cabin crew dismissed the issue with the AV system.

United Airlines,5.0,Steve Bryant,19th April 2015,"A recent flight from London to New York recently was perhaps the worst experience we've had. We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth.

Qatar Airways,9.0,John Moore,17th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Canberra to London via Sydney / Doha. This was the first time my wife and I had flown with Qatar Airways and my first international flight from Canberra. The B777 from Canberra are now the â€œSuitesâ€ version - as impressive as many reviewers have already reported and the onboard service - personal attention, food, beverage (see further comment below), in flight entertainment, ambience and comfort - as many have already stated is unmatched. My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested). After the short 30 minute hop to Sydney all passengers are required to disembark with all their carry-on. There are no further formalities at SYD, disembarkation being directly into the departures concourse",,,,,,,,,,,,
Emirates,4.0,Nguyen Anh,20th July 2014,Flew 2 weeks ago from Ho Chi Minh city (SGN) - (DXB - transit) - LHR (London) and back. My first time flying with Emirates. I was served with a hot towel and was able to watch my a film during take off. After flying for 5 hours I needed my bag with me. Unfortunately it was in the locker which was too high for me to reach so when I saw a flight attendant pass by I asked her if she could help. She helped me open the locker eventually but her attitude left me disappointed! On my way back from DXB to SGN I was lucky to have a lovely flight crew. In general the on board entertainment was very impressive. Even though the hot meals were served quickly they didn't taste good the food was incredibly salty and I couldn't finish it.

United Airlines,1.0,Cecil Brown,24th November 2015,"Anchorage to Taipei via Denver and Tokyo returning to SFO. This itinerary was a comedic failure of customer service on United's part. While confirming flight status with a United Rep in the Philippines the rep was constantly mixing up past, present, and future tense. I was not going to get off the phone until I understood my itinerary changes. Frustrated, she screamed at me for not understanding and disconnected the call. On the return flight from Osaka to San Fransisco an elderly lady next to me couldn't use her in-flight entertainment and it was stuck on a program she found disturbing (it is fixed into the seatback). She was ignored by flight staff repeatedly and I had to assist her for the duration of the flight. The cabin crew pointed at my tattoo and asked if it was Jewish (it's not, but who asks something like that). A glass bottle of whiskey broke in my bag and it was returned to me at SFO in a clear garbage bag with a booze puddle at the bottom. The staff didn't help, but just said ""We aren't responsible for this"" and set it at my feet and walked away. No napkin. No ""Hey I know this stinks but here is a trash can where you can pick the broken glass out of your clothes."" No, ""We can't take responsibiliy for the breakage but we are really sorry this happened."" Just ""Here"" I boarded my next flight the following day in whiskey-soaked clothes. Anchorage to Denver, I mistakenly sit on the wrong side of the isle boarding and the stewardess told me ""Remember, just like elementary school, A, B, C, D"" which is an inappropriate way to talk to an adult.

Air Canada,5.0,J De Boer,5th May 2014,Flew SYD-YVR business class on 777-200. The seat configuration is not great for couples my husband and I sat in the middle two seats and were divided by a partition and the angle of the seats meant that to speak to each other we both had to turn sideways and backwards. I could eyeball the person across the aisle more easily but the distance was such you couldn't have a quiet conversation thus still not satisfactory when traveling with someone. Not a lot of room to place personal items in easy reach during the flight. Service was excellent there was plenty of courteous and helpful staff. Food was nice 4 choices of main course I enjoyed my fish also the entree prawn salad. I have to agree with previous reviewer the head phones disposable foam ear pieces were very tricky to stretch over the phones easily torn and easily lost when taking the head phones off.

Service on the outbound flight was good and the larger premium economy seats which recline allowed us to sleep on this night time flight. Food was above average. However, the return flight was not nearly so happy. The flight out of Istanbul was delayed (which happens) and there was chaos in the waiting hall. Then it turned out that the aircraft wasn't able to come to the bridge which meant we had to be bussed to the plane which was in the cargo area a long distance from the terminal. The ground crew never explained to us why the airplane couldn't come to the bridge. So all of the passengers had to walk to the end of the bridge and down fairly steep metal stairs to the tarmac.

The general feel of the airplane was that it needs to be updated. The food was ok, the seat and leg room were ok (although the reclining seat was clunky and didn't work very well), the staff was great, but the entertainment part was definitely behind, and there were no plugs for smart phones or computers. First, they didn't provide ear buds. I came prepared and had my own. Even if you have your own, you need to ask for an adapter, precisely because of the age of their entertainment system. Their entertainment system is old (think probably from the early 90s). The colors on the screen were awful and you could barely see anything. I skipped all the major blockbusters in the selection, because watching them in such poor conditions would be ridiculous. The choice of movies was ok, but quite average compared to other modern airlines. On top of all that, my unit was not working properly for the whole beginning of the trip, and because of that, the call button for the staff was also not working. Eventually, I was able to grab someone from the staff and they had to reset the unit. All this to say that, although I would still be ok recommending the airline, it would be with some serious reserves.

Air Canada,1.0,Gregory Conti,8th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I was supposed to fly Air Canada from London Heathrow to Columbus via Toronto. After arriving in Toronto, I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. I was rebooked on a flight several hours later. This was then delayed, and I became worried that it would be cancelled. However, after repeated inquiries with the Air Canada gate agent, I was informed that it would be taking off that night, although hours late. Then at the last second this flight was cancelled, around 9 pm. No announcement was made of the cancellation until after it was supposed to have departed - the flight simply stopped being listed online or on the airport board. I entered a long customer service line, however, in the midst of waiting the agents went home from their shift. No clarity was provided about where we were supposed to go next. The customer service agents simply walked away. A long period of confusion in which it was simply impossible to find any Air Canada representatives. The amount of understaffing was appalling, and there appeared to be no urgency from anyone I spoke to about resolving the many issues that people were having. Finally, I wound up in a rebooking line, where I stood for over two hours before being helped. Despite repeated complaints from me and others to increase the level of staffing, this never happened: there were only two agents for dozens of customers. When I finally got to speak to someone, they made it clear that at the earliest I could fly to Columbus the following evening, because the earlier flights to Columbus were cancelled or fully-booked. The fact that I could not get out of Toronto until the following evening made my trip moot (it was only a two-day trip for a conference, one of which I would have completely missed). I therefore requested that I simply be booked a return ticket to London for the next morning and I gave up on my trip. After some haggling the agent reserved a place for me on a flight. However, although I was entitled by Air Canada policy to a hotel room for the night, none was provided for me. I spent the night on the floor of the Toronto airport. Despite pleading for some kind of compensation (I mentioned access to the airline lounge, so that I might change clothes / take a shower / have a minimum of comfort), I was given nothing but $20 of food vouchers. The next day my flight back to London was delayed almost two hours simply out of poor handling. In sum, Air Canada showed complete indifference to stranded travellers, made no effort to provide adequate staffing to deal with the problems that stranded travellers were facing",,,,,,,,,,,,

Delta Air Lines,3.0,D Stewart,26th August 2014,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no
Lufthansa,1.0,P Ries,13th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Luxemburg to Frankfurt. I purchased a ticket on the Lufthansa website for flight LH 393. Marked as being operated by Lufthansa, as the original ticket confirms. Upon arrival at the airport in Luxembourg, I had to find out, that Lufthansa has decided to use Air Nostrum aircraft as wet lease on this routing for a couple of months already, without ever feeling the need to inform customers of the change of service. Air Nostrum is a substandard low cost airline, normally operating on behalf of Iberia. Not even a Star Alliance partner. There was zero service onboard. Flight attendants were rude. They basically disappeared out of sight immediately after takeoff, only to be seen again for final landing procedures. This is in no way what I expected upon buying a Lufthansa flight. Shelling out good money. If I want to go low cost, no frills, I can get it way cheaper.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Luxemburg to Frankfurt,October 2018,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

The only negative point remains that KLM charges a hefty price, as flyers on this route are captive (and mostly business travel).

My husband and I have the American Airlines card and have access to their lounge which we pay $400 for annually. The treatment from the staff of the Miami airport tonight is outrageous. We will be canceling and never flying with them again. I understand delays are out of their control but we sat on and unconditioned plane for an hour just to then sit at the airport with literally no update on our constantly delayed flight for hours. To say Iâ€™m outraged and disappointed is a major understatement. This has ruined our entire vacation. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m even paying for this flight they call service.

United Airlines,1.0,T Gugelyk,14th April 2014,HNL to BKK. Aborted take off in HNL. Plane back to ramp sit inside plane for 5 hours. Problem could not be fixed mechanical. Flight cancelled. Told to disembark get out luggage at Arrivals and go to Departure area to rebook. This on a 747 with 350 plus people on it - all pulling their luggage about 1/2 mile to Departure area. Line up at departure area United to re-book - wait 7 hours to get to counter. Only 2 staff members to rebook the entire airplane. I was put on Delta the next day to NRT. Gave me $10 voucher for meals and over night free stay in Waikiki hotel. Cheapest meal at hotel was $18. Next AM Delta took off on time got me to TKO then transfer to United back to BKK.

Qatar Airways,8.0,G Meares,28th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Melbourne via Doha. I found an excellent fare with Qatar so I had to give them a go. My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you.

Air Canada,10.0,D Rosenberg,10th December 2014,"AC flight 85 YYZ-TLV in business. The flight was flawless service was excellent food was good to excellent. The AC 787 is an amazing product well designed and comfortable. Missing overhead bins in the center above rows 4 and 5 made for a few uncomfortable minutes as we boarded - flight attendants should anticipate this and be available to help. The seat is excellent long enough and wide enough. Yes the foot well is narrow but I got comfortable and slept deeply for 4 hours (same issue on Swiss United ANA). The pillow and comforter are far better than those offered by United Swiss Lufthansa. The adjustable cushions make it the best Business seat I have experienced.

Emirates,3.0,A Broomes,10th August 2015,"The cabin on the new Airbus is lovely. Comfortable bar and lounge area, excellent seats with your own personal mini-bar. On these facilities I have no complaints. My disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof, and I am afraid the ultimate criticism - it was no different to being in Economy. On each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men, despite waiting patiently I always had to ask. On an 8 hour evening flight I was told, ""we don't hand these out on evening flights."" The menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. But in reality there is no choice, just like in Economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. Tray table is pulled out on the hour, breakfast arrives 20 mins later, coffee follows after 10 mins, and the refill never came. Within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. I could see post take off drinks being served, but I was never offered one. It becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. I have often mocked the likes of Virgin for their automated approach to customer service - but at least you all receive the same service, it is not the luck of the draw. They are inefficient, unorganised, rude, and left me in no doubt that I will never travel Emirates Business Class again.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Johanesburg via Dubai,August 2015,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,no

Southwest Airlines,,Luke Bailey,1st July 2014,"Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay. Southwest cannot and will not do the same.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,,,,2.0,no

I really enjoyed the possibility of using WiFi on the Boeing 777, it really makes a long haul flight less ""long"". Don't expect to be streaming YouTube etc., but paying $5 to be able to use WhatsApp in-flight is a really nice feature in my opinion. The legroom on the Airbus was decent, however the legroom on the Boeing was a pain. Sadly, this is the case with almost all economy classes nowadays. The in-flight entertainment system was nice as well and it offered some good movies. The food was okay, especially the dinner, but the breakfast wasn't very special. They offer enough drinks.

The Economy flight DXB to Tokyo and the return was in Business. Funny thing was the Economy journey was better reasonable food and service. The seats were good for Economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. The service in Business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average. The seats I found very narrow and carried the vibrations of people walking past and the person next to me moving around. We were delayed nearly 5 hours on-route because of fog in Dubai which is not the airlines fault of course but a lack of communicating left everyone wondering what was going on.

Unbelievably rude and dismissive in-flight service: I got up to ask the flight attendant for water in the bathroom/mid-section area. She was bent down and shoveling trays inside a cabinet. There were other passengers standing around her - clearly waiting for her to finish. But not only did she not pay attention to any of us, but when I gently asked if I could just grab the water and pour it myself, she glared and almost shouted at me - ""Can you not see that I'm in the middle of something!"" Then she thrust the bottle into my hands and as I turned away she said, ""Hold up! Where do you think you are going with that bottle of water!"" Another passenger around us took some empty cups and passed to me as we poured each other water and did not want to get in the way of this flight attendant's anger. When it came time for sandwich/food service. This same flight attendant pulled the cart asking people ""sandwich? sandwich?"" When she came to my row (which is not far from the front), I used my most friendly voice to ask her could she tell me what kind of sandwich are were. To my surprise, she gave out a loud and exasperated sigh - turned to ask her colleague about the type of sandwich, turned to me and said, ""it's turkey, turkey!""

United sells more economy tickets than there are economy seats on the plane and then expects me to either pay more money to fly or spend the night, at my expense, in Durango. They should have just given us the seats. My son was on a flight leaving Durango after ours for Denver and because of delays missed his connecting flight for Oklahoma.

Emirates,8.0,David Clark,8th May 2015,I travelled from Heathrow to Dubai and then onto Singapore. On my return it was from Tokyo to Dubai and then onto Heathrow. As far as I am concerned it has been the best airline that I have travelled with. Seating and leg room was more than enough (I'm 6 foot). The food was adequate but how many breakfasts and lunches can you eat? Mine was a total of 8. One consideration which I was very pleased with is the fact that I am asthmatic and every time without exception I have ended up with a cold or infection. Not this time on all of the above flights.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,P Scott,15th February 2019,"Not Verified | Humberside to Santiago de Chile via Amsterdam. I am coeliac (gluten free) and requested the special meals. There were provided but the quality of the meals on the return flight in particular was very poor. There was not really enough to eat with the dinner (as they could or did not pad it out with bread.) I was hungry again straight after. The breakfast was particularly poor. Sometimes the special meals are provided jointly with another special type (often dairy and lactose free) and then they are particularly unappetizing. The hot part of this was small chunks of boiled potato, a quarter of a small cooked tomato and boiled spinach. Yuk! This was followed by a small fruit salad and a very small pack of some crisp bread that sticks to the teeth. At least on the way out they attempted to provided gluten free bread rolls. Those crisp breads are poor and so airy they do not curb an appetite. On a 13 hour flight this was not adequate and all the galley could offer at night were small bags of crisps (chips in American).

American Airlines,1.0,M Barlen,12th October 2018,Providence to Los Angeles via Philadelphia. This was the worst travel experience I've ever had. I missed my connection in Philadelphia due to a maintenance issue on the plane. I landed at 8:52pm and was told by customer service in Philadelphia the next flight out was not until the next morning at almost 9:00am. I was looking at a 12 hour layover so obviously I wanted to stay in a hotel. I was told I would have to pay out of pocket by customer service. I had to argue for a while that it wasn't my fault the connection was missed and that I shouldn't have to pay out of pocket for the hotel. After the customer service agent agreed to give me a free hotel stay she said all of the vouchers were already given out. She then told me I could purchase my own and I would be reimbursed. There is a hotel attached to the Philadelphia airport and their cheapest room was $313. After taxes and fees it came out to $364. Since I was told I was getting a reimbursement I didn't think it mattered how much I paid. At that point I purchased my own hotel and the next day e-mailed American Airlines for my reimbursement. An agent e-mailed me the next day telling me I would not be getting a refund. After arguing my case over e-mail and the phone I was then told I would be getting $120 back. I have been trying for days to get the rest of the reimbursement but have been told multiple times the maximum reimbursement for hotel stays are $120. It doesn't seem to matter that I was told I would be getting a full reimbursement. The fact that they are willing to lose business over $244 is so crazy to me. This is the worst customer service I have experienced and I will not be giving them my business or recommending them to anyone anymore.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Los Angeles via Philadelphia,October 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,S Latimer,20th June 2014,Why is it that United is the only airline that cancelled a flight from Denver to Omaha due to weather but all the other airlines going to and from Denver only delayed? Of course because we are having poor weather they can blame it on the weather which means as a customer we cannot recoup anything from them and we have to then wait until a pm flight when we are scheduled on the first flight out of OMA.

Nobody offered us a flight with other Star Alliance carrier on the same day (2nd Feb). Nobody tried to facilitate our plans to reach our destination on time or with a slight delay not a 3 day delay.

Air Canada,1.0,Kale Tyler,25th March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Samana. After booking my honeymoon at a 5 star resort through air Canada vacations we proceeded to spend 48 hours in different Canadian airports with zero support, compensation or even apologies from the airline. Not only were we stranded on the first night of our marriage but when we were told in Edmonton that we would be taken care of for room and board in Montreal, where we were to wait until the following evening to fly, we were informed after landing that they hadn't arranged for enough rooms. As a result, my wife and I had to spend an additional 280$ on the only room left anywhere near the airport. As it was already very late at night we were only able to sleep for 5 hrs before we had to catch another plane backtracking to Toronto where we would continue our layover for another 10 hrs. The trip started at 7am on a Saturday and we ended up arriving in Dominican monday morning. After many attempts to talk to phone representatives, as suggested by all the management at the airports, we were able to convince them to leave us with 30$ food vouchers for 2 people and 48 hrs of travel! Anyone you talk to in this company has their hands tied and is very willing to hand you off to another person or direct you to another phone number where you wait on hold, once for 2.5 hrs, only to be redirected elsewhere so on and so forth. At least we weren't fully out of pocket for our days spent at the airport, having paid with a WestJet credit card of all things.

I was so disappointed and astounded how bad their business class product has become. Both the food and wine were not up to standard. The Airshow system was not working and the entertainment choices were very poor. The seats are not lie flat until you complete something akin to a military exercise to set up a bed with a mattress. Cost cutting measures are so evident as even the bread rolls look smaller and the hot face towels given to you look like they have been cut in half. The four flight stewards did their best but who on earth decided to dress them in tight waist coats and aprons? Other airlines I have flown provide a far better level of service at a lower fare and I will not be flying Air New Zealand again on their long haul sectors as I do not think they look after their business class passengers like other airlines.

Turkish Airlines,8.0,A Benado,26th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation.

We sat on the ground for an hour, and ultimately arrived 2-hours late at our destination. A review of the AA615 activity log indicates this is not an uncommon occurrence.

United Airlines,8.0,Mordey Stephen,22nd September 2014,I've been a Mileage Plus member and a United frequent flyer since 1995. The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Excellent check in at Singapore and smooth boarding. Modern aircraft with very good amenities and food. Cabin staff were friendly and helpful. Easy transit in Istanbul and punctual departure for Edinburgh. Boeing 737 on the second sector was modern and comfortable. In flight entertainment was fine - food and service likewise. I think Turkish Airlines represents great value for money and on the basis of my experience I'd have no hesitation in flying with them again.

American Airlines,7.0,R Paterson,3rd January 2014,RDU-LHR return in Y. Outbound check-in and bag check handled smoothly no complaints. Boarding somewhat chaotic but this was mainly due to the layout of the gate area. Aircraft on this route are older 763s with no IFE but seats and toilets seemed in decent condition. Food decent enough and FAs - while not terribly friendly - were diligent about offering drinks. Entertainment was pretty miserable but what do you expect when you have no seatback system and have to rely on the overheads? Pretty laughable for an international leg. Return flight check- in at LHR was a breeze but boarding was infuriating! Pax with group 3/4 boarding passes rushing the gate during pre-boarding gate attendants barely speaking above a whisper when announcing boarding groups. Really ridiculous. FAs on return flight much friendlier. Main Cabin Extra proved worthwhile as the legroom was plentiful. All in all worth the competitive fare but not nearly at the standard of other nations' flag carriers.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,yes

This delay meant a missed connection. There was no one from Turkish Airlines to help or assist. After visiting several counters, waiting for hours, I was given new boarding card for a flight 24 hours later. They did not provide any meal and when I asked for a hotel they made me pay for the visa. The next day they asked me to be ready to go to the airport but they did not come and pick me up. Hotel management contacted the airline and they said I should keep waiting. An hour before the flight time, I decided to take a taxi. Due to a flight delay, I managed to catch my flight.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Xavier Bous,24th February 2015,The check-in and departure time are always chaotic with Turkish Airlines. I flew already 8 times with Turkish and they are usually late. Connections at Istanbul are tight which is not matching with the systematic delays of Turkish Airways. If you miss your plane the hotel is provided by Turkish Airlines but the transfer to the hotel is terrible without mentioning the terrible and unprofessional attitude from the visas service + immigration + info desks at Istanbul Airport. Globally I would not recommend Turkish Airways. Even if I omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is OK there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with Turkish Airways - maybe courtesy from their staff. The only point I am impressed about is that even if Istanbul Airport seems to be an organizational chaos the luggage is usually arriving at the final destination even when the time between connection flights are tight (of course if the planes are on time).,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,no

When my baby cried they helped me calm her down especially one staff member who saved my sanity he even made me an iced coffee with out me asking. The second flight was not as great as I felt the staff weren't as friendly and welcoming I had the assistance light on for over an hour and no one came and when I tried to wave someone down they would just ignore me. You could also hear a few of them moaning about being tired and hungry which I don't think is very professional. The main thing I would say that was bad was at the baggage claim when the buggy's were the last items to be put round the belt so there was a lot of tired babies and parents waiting for their buggies.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

United Airlines,3.0,N Burkoski,13th October 2014,Travelled on a connecting flight from Toronto to Houston TX en route to Rio de Janeiro. Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,no

Every thing on both flights went like clockwork with true German efficiency just like Aldi but with Waitrose quality.

I am a frequent flyer with TK (Elite) and there are many things I like about TK but the biggest problem of this airline is consistency. Some flights are excellent while others are just a horrible experience. This happened with my flights to EZE and back from GRU. The plane on both legs was awful. Under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom. Overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of. It had not been cleaned properly before departure. The staff were not attentive forgetting my requests. On the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice. The temperature during the flight - freezing. The lounge in GRU is a joke. The good TAM lounge is closed at night and they use the Smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable.

Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service.

I had only one really bad flight that was delayed for about 4 hours but that was the worst of it. There are no ""middle seats"" as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts - the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron. I like that.

Air Canada,5.0,L Satoun,18th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Calgary to Ft McMurray. Air Canada in flight services and reliability is typically decent. I fly with them a fair bit. What I am reviewing today is the state of their customer service. Firstly, I should mention that, at the best of time, reaching them to modify a flight requires 20 mins of waiting over the phone unless you have the altitude member number (35K and over I understand). But what I am writing to flag and rant about today is how difficult my last experience trying to obtain a justification of payment has been. The amount that was charged to my card for one of my last flights matches neither the amount I was expecting to pay nor the receipt sent to me. I initially reached the phone line and was sent to www.aircanada.com/en/customercare/ticketreceipt. I explained my request and never received any response other than a no-reply acknowledgment of my request. 6 weeks and 2 additional request (complaints) to the customer service went by. 20 days after my last follow-up, I finally receive a very helpful email that indicates that she is unable to help but that I should contact www.aircanada.com/en/customercare/ticketreceipt. 6 weeks and I am back where I started.

United Airlines,7.0,K Hose,14th September 2014,I have to say I was extremely hesitant after reading the reviews on this site and due to fly with UA on 22nd August 2014. I had 5 flights covering a 3 week period and flew from Glasgow - Newark- Las Vegas - San Fran - San Diego back to Newark - Glasgow and was totally happy with the service provided to my family and I. We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them.

American Airlines,1.0,Andrew Kin,11th March 2016,"Just had a horrible experience - I had a red-eye American Airlines flight to Miami from LAX for an important meeting. The flight was supposed to leave at midnight, and was on a ""new"" plane, according to the captain. Before even taxiing, the airplane began to experience computer issues. Multiple attempts to fix this, including a reboot, rewiring, and many false starts all resulted in nothing. In the end, I got off the plane because there was no way I could make my meeting in Miami in time. The plane ended up taking off around 7:30 am after a 7.5 hour delay. On top of that, American is taking up to 6-8 weeks (according to their timeline) to refund me the seat upgrade I paid for, didn't take accountability for this issue or suggest solutions, and didn't give any miles or more than a half-hearted apology by e-mail.

United Airlines,4.0,C Lin,23rd June 2014,In a recent long-haul flight (UA871) SFO-TPE business class again ran out of the Asian meal option. This occurred in 4 out of my 5 recent transpacific flights. The purser came and apologized. She said United loaded only four such meals into a business class that seats 44 passengers! With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration? It's pretty bad given that for the same fare one can fly in a much more spacious environment on competing airlines.

United Airlines,1.0,Nicole Lynch,8th December 2015,"My husband and I used United Airlines for our honeymoon. The night before we left we noticed that my husband's name was wrong on his boarding pass. When we explained the situation, the reps were very nice, they seemed to be working as quickly as possible and they got us on the earliest flight possible. The trip home: Our itinerary was SFO-Newark, NJ - Portland, ME. Our flight from SFO was delayed. We land in Newark and sprint to our gate with minutes to spare and were told ""that flight was cancelled"" and directed us to customer service. We wait in line for about 5 minutes before a rep states to the crowd, ""we are closing, you need to go to the other customer service line."" We wait for about 45 minutes in the new line. When we get to the counter, the rep asks how he can help us, I state, ""We'd just like the earliest flight to Portland, ME please"". He asks if we'd be willing to split up and we explain that we'd rather not. He suggests a flight to Boston. I tell him we have no way to Portland after that and he says to call family (it's past midnight). I say that's not an option, but the rep still pushed it. 5 minutes later he suggests a 10am flight for us, we ask for that and give him our boarding passes. He scans mine and says, ""so how were you planning on getting to Portland?"" I say, ""what do you mean? with that boarding pass I just gave you."" He explains that the flight was cancelled due to weather, which at this point we had known for hours. I say, ""yes, that's why we're trying to get on the 10a flight tomorrow."" He says that our flight ends in Newark. At this point my husband and I were extremely confused because our passes clearly stated Portland. He suggests a rental car. We sleep in the airport for a few hours and rent a car. He never gave us boarding passes, and almost lost my husbands baggage claim ticket. Our TA spent a long time going back and forth with United customer service. We were confirmed for a 6am flight, despite not receiving boarding passes. She tried to get them to refund us for our car but United stated that they ""don't reimburse for rental cars"".

I thought she was coming back so I was reluctant to fall asleep, I sat on my soaked blanket to soak up the coffee on the chair. Half an hour later she didn't return so I had to ask a third member of the crew. The crew were rude about getting the trolleys past us and when they hit a man's foot they didn't apologise. They looked stressed and annoyed during the flight safety announcement. When they brought round the warm towels the stewardess handed one to the person next to me then noticed she had none left to give me. She said ""oh"" and walked away. When another steward came to collect our towels I said I never received one and he frowned, looked around, and walked away. I wasn't spoken to again. Halfway through the flight an alarm went off and a yellow light flashed the stewardesses asked each other ""what does that mean"". I pointed to the screen by the toilets where it said ""smoke detected"". They swore and ran off and came back later to announce ""it was just someone's deodorant"".

Planes were comfortable and clean (A320 and 764) with adequate room for my 5'8"" self. Crews were generally fantastic a real surprise given United's reputation. I like United's boarding structure as it prevents a mad dash to board and worked very well making boarding easy and comfortable. Only gripe is food on 10 hour IAH-MUC flight- small dinner and then before landing a mini croissant and small fruit cup- This is what I usually get on YYZ-MUC but that is a 7 hour flight.

Lufthansa,10.0,C Dawes,16th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Victoria-Vancouver-Frankfurt-Geneva on 24 April 2018, returning 10 May. Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1Â¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options â€“ vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.","Dash 8-Q400, Boeing 747-400, CRJ-700, A319",Business,Economy Class,Victoria to Geneva via Vancouver-Frankfurt,April 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Whilst the second leg was obviously a superior product, the old seats were acceptable for a reasonably short flight. Crew on both legs were very good - friendly, outgoing, and attentive, and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Food was good, though the selection of wine was reasonably limited and not particularly exciting nor high-end. Crew made sure I was constantly topped up. Really loved their crockery and cutlery - cool designs and a nice touch. Bathrooms had good Zenology products, but the amenity kits were seriously lacking - no body care products at all.

She also said that the only seats available are middle seats.

American Airlines,2.0,P Yeung,31st January 2014,LAX-NRT Economy cabin B777-200. Have to say one of my worst experiences in a very long time. Were told before boarding the IFE was broken so expect no TV for the next 12 hrs. Boarded an old plane with dirty cabins. Blanket and candy wrappers in my/ my wife's seat pockets. To my right on the other side of the aisle there was a lady with an empty seat next to her. She wanted to fold up the armrest so she could sleep across but the armrest would not stay up which was later solved by flight attendants using masking tape. My reading light was broken. American Airlines truly lived up to what US airlines are famous for - grumpy flight attendants shouting at foreign passengers who merely wanted to find out more about the food they were being served. And while on food absolutely horrible and I am sure anyone on that flight would have described it as such. Same chicken and rice dish for both meals but called different names. Same sauce same meat but one with carrots and onions. Not asking for Michelin- starred gourmet meals but this was just miles apart from coach class catering at other airlines I have flown with for example Cathay or Japan Airlines. If they can do it why can't American. Flight attendants delivering service chewing gum. Signs they were getting a tad too relaxed about their work environment.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Lawrence Osborne,14th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated. As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money. I'll leave Business trips to the big boys.",A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,BKK to JFK via IST,2015-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no

Lufthansa,2.0,Brice Dallard,3rd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toulouse to Singapore via Frankfurt. The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled: no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates). Considering the ticket price, I will not fly with them again, mostly because of FRA airport, and the ""ghost"" customer relations department.

For this reason, we have always been willing to pay the extra dollars to book our flights through them, as opposed to booking with one of the cheaper airlines. However, the last 3 times we have flown Southwest have been just awful. They lost our car seat the first time, our luggage the second time, and then the third time we experienced a 3.5 hour delay followed by a cancelled flight at 9.30pm. On top of this, we have encountered terrible customer service every step of the way in dealing with these stressful circumstances. Each time we traveled the personnel working at the ticket counter have been unbelievably rude. Great way to start the trip. When items were lost, instead of being helpful and accommodating, the customer service agent working in lost baggage was very brusque and actually yelled at us, and then refused to do something as simple as validate a $7 parking ticket for my husband who had to park and come in to help me with the situation since I was traveling alone with our 6 month old. Finally, when we were flying home to Denver, our flight was delayed 3.5 hours and then cancelled. The entire time the woman working the gates to the flight was yelling at people and being extremely rude. We all had to wait 1-2 hours in line to rebook our flights, and then we found out the next day when we called in that they never even rebooked a flight for us.

No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane.

As I arrived to the gate the women checking the tickets let me know by her body language that I would not enjoy my flight.

Once I scanned my ticket I was told I had to check my bag, there were still about 40 people waiting to board the plane. When asked why I received attitude of ""it just does, there is no room on the plane."" As I get on the plane I notice empty overhead bins everywhere and as I am walking down I see that a majority of the bags are small personal items. Purses, small backpacks, plastic bags. So basically I had to check my bag because United fails to enforce policy and as well prematurely calls the aircraft ""full"". The whole point of me traveling light is so that I do not have to check my bag as this is one of the biggest headaches about traveling. I'll tell you I have never had this issue on competing airlines. Judging by the reviews of 3/10 I'd say that is accurate.

Lufthansa,10.0,Matteo Tonelli,25th March 2016,"Flew from Pisa to Chicago via Munich. If traveling Lufthansa I recommend passing in their splendid Munich hub. The first flight, from Pisa, was quick and easy, leaving on time, with respectful crew and beverages. No entertainment options on this flight because it is only a quick regional 1-hour flight. Had 1:25 minutes to catch the long international flight. The A340-600 that was used for the 9-hour flight was splendid. The seats were comfortable, as I was seated in 45k, which is the second row of economy. Inflight Entertainment (IFE) worked great, with the touchscreen functionality being as smooth as any tablet, unlike most planes. Very good selection of movies, and TV shows and games were also available. Food was great, giving plentiful food that left me satisfied during the entire voyage. We arrived in Chicago 10 minutes in advance, even though we left 10 minutes behind schedule. Deplaning was as efficient as boarding. All in all, I had a pleasant experience (especially since I could sleep), and arrived Chicago nice a refreshed.

Very friendly attendants: I was sitting beside a couple that was ignoring every instruction. The man was on his phone almost until take off, and neither of them stowed their carry-on during take-off or landing. Despite this, more than one attendant helped them cheerfully. Due to a misunderstanding of when we were landing, I tried to order some food close to landing time. The attendant in my section was polite, explained that they weren't supposed to take any more orders, but then gave me a free sandwich (worth around $6.50 on this domestic flight) to give me the benefit of the doubt.

Lufthansa,4.0,E Matthews,31st July 2014,The flight I took 3 days ago (Vancouver-Munich) was one of the most unpleasant flights I have taken of late. I am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again I was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better. The staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. The onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films TV and languages.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

I thought it was a very personal touch and made him feel special. Both flights were pleasant, the aircraft clean and we even arrived a little early on both flights.

Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777.

Flight was late taking off for no reason they could give us. We sat on the plane ready for take off an hour before leaving but they assured all of us going to ABQ would make our connecting flight. We landed get to the gate in SFO and they had just shut the door. There was 8 of us who they would not let on. When I called into customer care they would get us there till almost 24 hours later with a flight that would have another connection so who knows if we would have made that. I asked if there was a fight I could get on with another airline that would get me there that night as I needed to be. She looked and said no. I found one on AK Airlines and she said she couldnâ€™t book with them only American. I asked about getting a reimbursement on my ticket with United and she said as long as I didnâ€™t get on the next flight with them. Was on the phone waiting to talk to manager and I got hung up on. I purchase ticket with AK Airlines that can get me there that day. Call back as Iâ€™m walking to their gates. He only refunded me half the ticket since I used the other half. Stated I would have to email a complaint to get other part of ticket back. Well after months of emails and calling I have not received the other half back or anything towards that AK Airlines ticket. They say there is nothing they can do. All I was asking for was $35 dollars! Plus when I got to the AK Airlines gate United had put one lady on that flight so they could have done it. Long story short horrible customer service with no results except a $50 off my next flight with them.

Virgin America,2.0,A Barnes,7th August 2012,Four members of our family used Virgin America for our return flight from San Francisco to Chicago. Included in our party was our 81 year old mother who uses a walker. She always gets a window seat for the least possibility of the need to move. The flight became unbearable when 5 passengers from the back came to visit with the 3 passengers seating directly in the row in front of us. As they ordered several rounds of alcohol they begin cursing. What made matters worse is that when we complained to the steward they suggest that we move to the back of the plane and that there was nothing they could do. Due to our mother's condition we were unable to move but they continued to bring the rounds of alcohol to the party in front of us. We felt like we were in a bar our fight was from 7.45pm to midnight central time and our mother had to endure 3 hours of torture.

American Airlines,4.0,G Oliver,17th October 2015,"Book a flight with American Airlines but get a BA flight number. Want to pre book selected seats ? Use BA, no - use American Airlines stupid. Want to chose seats and check in - use BA flight number. Why can't I check in ? After 3 calls to BA's useless customer services"" we are told we can't check in online as it's closed to us, as we didn't select seats in time (news to me and never got any of this information from the website at the time of booking - nor did we get any warning notice telling us of the cut off point). All the more confusing as American Airlines allocated seat to us for the 2nd leg of the journey from JFK to Miami. Confused - we are ! We are offered the chance to pre book online for $30 per seat (what is this scam ?) but impolitely decline after spending a whole day online trying to sort it out. So just to be clear - the first part we have to pay for seats but the connecting flight we had seats allocated by American Airlines (at no cost). On the 2nd leg to Miami from JFK we are warned that, as per usual (in our experience on US domestic flights), there is a massive overbooking of cabin luggage and not enough space. As usual passengers refuse to give up their right to take endless pieces of baggage on with them so there is delay while ground staff literally confiscate baggage to put in the hold. Truly the indignation of tight fisted travellers with totally unrealistic expectations is a sight to behold. Everyone expects to get 2 pieces on board, regardless. No more internal flights for me, thank you. From now on it's British Airways or Virgin and damn the cost. The return flight (direct from Miami to JFK) - is it too much to expect that on a 10 hour flight we might get some inflight entertainment (and I don't mean 1 film). Truly pitiful. We board on the third group (not the last group) and guess what - no overhead locker space. Getting tired of this experience now. US airlines really have to sort this out and impose realistic expectations on their customers. Food average for economy, except the coffee which was really awful (I'm no coffee snob but how can you get this wrong American Airlines?) Cabin crew were okay to rude (congrats to the the one lady that really made the effort, on the other side of the plane). Got a nice warm ""thank you"" from everyone on departing the plane - but that doesn't make up for the previous 10 hours of mean spiritedness from the cabin crew. Ground staff very helpful and a simple, stress free experience. But really it's all about the flight - and American Airlines just don't cut it. It just seems US airlines are all in a race to the bottom (on price) and everything suffers accordingly.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to Miami via JFK,October 2015,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,D Pan,5th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver. My family's wonderful Hawaii trip had a very upsetting ending due to Air Canada's horrible service. We endured multiple flight delays and cancellations due to technical issues with their planes and had to pay for three hotel rooms out of pocket to accommodate our 8-month old baby and my elderly parents who would have been stranded overnight in two separate cities. It took us 2+ days to get back home (instead of the scheduled 23 hours). Our returning flight AC1830 was delayed due to technical issues. We found out about the delay when we arrived at the airport around 7:00 pm (no previous warning) and the departure was initially postponed from 10:00 pm to 3:45 am but got delayed again to 4:15 am early in the morning. AC told us that since they didn't cancel the flight they were not responsible to book us a hotel room despite the fact that we had an infant and two seniors travelling with us. I couldn't understand how AC expected families with small children and babies to deal with this - sleep on the airport floor? We decided to book a hotel room on our own since we have 20+ hours flight ahead of us and an infant baby travelling with us. A motel room with airport shuttle cost us $200+tax USD/room due to the last minute booking. AC did postpone the departure again from 3:45 to 4:15 am. Neither my husband nor I was able to sleep well as we were afraid to miss our flight. This was only the beginning of our horrible experience. We were supposed to have two connecting flights after arriving in Vancouver (VAN-TOR, TOR-DL). Due to this first delay, AC had to cancel our subsequent flights and rebook the rest of our trip. Instead of flying to Deer Lake on the same night we arrived in Toronto, we had to stay in Toronto overnight. However, AC couldn't give us the rest of our boarding passes, nor could it book a hotel in Toronto for us. The agent in Honolulu told us that we needed to get the hotel from AC's customer service in Toronto once we got there. AC's flight from Vancouver to Toronto got delayed again and the plane did not land in Toronto airport until 10:45 pm on May 2nd. By the time we got off the plane it was almost 11:30pm. There were 50+ people in line at the AC customer service kiosk, while only two to three agents were working. The line hardly moved and after midnight an agent came to the line telling us all the hotels around the airport were sold out and we had to look for hotels on our own. He said the desk would be closing in 30 minutes and the agents would leave despite there were still so many of us unserved. He told us to call AC to rebook our flights. He also told us to find hotel on our own",,,,,,,,,,,,

The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom.

When I did figure out where to go, I entered my info into the kiosk but needed an employee to verify it. She patronized me and treated me like a moron for not being able to scan my passport. I never fly United and will try not to again. This experience made me realize how politely Iâ€™ve always been treated by Southwest, and now I wonâ€™t take that for granted.

I called back again, they said they don't know if it will be more delayed and I will not be able to make it to the flight to UK. So I said, I want to canceled the tickets.

I have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. I stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers.

Air Canada,6.0,Lien John,31st December 2014,B787 AC004 NRT to YVR Dec 22nd 2014 seat 3G. Offered menu choices soon after take off by meal time we were informed that they had run out of the beef option. In Business class no less! My wife didn't want the alternatives and therefore declined to eat. I told the attendant to give the beef to her and I'll have the salmon. The service director explained that even though we were full paying passengers there is a priority system there in terms of menu items. They had to take care of their Elite Super Elite and Million Milers before the others. We found this unbelievable in terms of a company policy. How much can it cost Air Canada to provide sufficient meal choices in J class? As it turned out the beef tenderloin was anything but tender or tasty. The rest of the flight was uneventful the seat was fairly comfortable and converted to flat bed easily. Turbulence prevented hot drinks service but that wasn't anyone's fault. The movie and TV choices were pretty pathetic compared to having just come off a Singapore Airlines business class segment from SIN to NRT. There was no comparison in the level of service the comfort and width of the seat and the meals. In fact when I mentioned this to the AC service director she candidly admitted that she was aware that they did not match up to SQ or Emirates in J class. I felt sorry for her as she was attentive a hard worker and did her best but had to comply with a restrictive mandate working for an airline that has a lot of room to improve.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no

My experience with the American Airlines flight AA1048 (1 June 2017) was by far the worst experience I have had with any airline. Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late. I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way. AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone.

For the first time I decided to finally use my miles towards a car rental. I went ahead and applied 28,800 miles for a 6 day rental in Mallorca (paid in full). When I came to pick up the car at the PMI airport, the teller did not recognize the voucher and prompted me to provide my credit card. At first I thought it was only for incidentals but at the end of my trip, they charged my card in full ($274). I only realized this after I arrived back home. I contacted American Airlines and informed them of the issue. They acknowledged that Avis (the rental car company) made a mistake and that they would facilitate a refund of my miles. After a few days passing, I did not hear back from American Airlines nor did I see the miles credit back on my AAdvantage account. I followed-up with American Airlines. A representative responded to my inquiry and informed me that there is nothing they can do. I repeatedly inquired to escalate this issue to the supervisor. He claimed he was a supervisor and said there was nothing they can do. In short, I spent 28,800 and $274 for a mini-car for 6 days. Is this fair? I think not.

Air Canada,2.0,Corner Geo,11th November 2014,A return flight from Vancouver to Heathrow was very disappointing in many ways. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. During the long overnight flight the cabin was ridiculously and uncomfortably warm making sleep difficult there was an unsettled noisy baby on board to whose parents the flight crew offered no help and due to the stupid design of the seats incorporating lights and volume controls in the top of the arm rests it was quite impossible to rest ones arms or support oneself on these armrests. The delay however then created the greatest problems. Passengers with onward connections were told to contact Air Canada ground crew. We were assured we had been rebooked on a later BA flight to Edinburgh. There was not actually enough time to transfer to the flight in Terminal 5 but that in itself did not matter as we (and many other passengers) had been misled. None of us had been rebooked. Fortunately BA did sort out the mess without any assistance from Air Canada who had gone incommunicado and would not answer calls. We were fortunate that we were able to complete our journey that day. I am not certain all our fellow abandoned passengers were so lucky. I am afraid I could never trust Air Canada in the future.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,no

I think my loyalty has hit a wall. The good: the flight attendants are professional and the entertainment is pretty good as is the schedule options to and from the US from Japan. The bad: old planes, hard seats in business, small AVOD screens, dirty toilets, captains constantly using toilets in business class so passengers are blocked, mediocre food. On top of this, baggage snafu in ATL caused my travel partner and I to miss our connection on the way to RDU and they would not put us on the next available flight until I threw a fit. That's customer service in the US. You have to behave badly to be treated well. I'm considering the hot Japanese carriers on my next trip where I know the food and seats are superior.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,K Warinska,15th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Cleveland to Amsterdam via Atlanta. Really really horrible customer service at their own hub airport in Atlanta. Flight delayed due to their maintenance issue, connection missed and they treat you like you're some annoying homeless person and at first tell you to go to 5 different places, then when you're at the right place, you are not allowed to ask a question without standing first in line for 4 hours (yes 4 hours starting at 12 am) when you get to the counter you're being told that they won't help you because some system error airline didn't release the ticket and they will wait until 8 am when the airline opens at their airport. You're not getting a hotel because they have none available from their partners! So they expect you to ""hang-around"" for 20 hours after already traveling for long to wait for your flight giving you a 15$ voucher for food! This is the most ridiculous service I've ever experienced. When I summed up the fact that they made me wait in line for 4 hours to tell me they won't help me, they denied ever telling me to stand in the line. Very rude and arrogant staff.

Breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. Got to FRA with a 2 hour connection. Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am. The food was awful. Seats on the 747 as uncomfortable as the A330. Crew were polite.,Boeing 737/747,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Mumbai via FRA,July 2015,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,no

Aeromexico,8.0,K Wagner,1st December 2015,"Chicago to Huatulco via Mexico City. This was the first time I flew Aeromexico. We had a bad problem in Mexico City with our luggage. Being in Mexico City, not a lot of employees speak English and we don't speak Spanish. We went thru customs and was told by an Aeromexico employee to put all of our luggage on the conveyor, even from what we understood our carry ons. Two of our carry on had name tags an Aeromexico tag and one had no identification on it whatsoever. After about 10 minutes we realized that we shouldn't have done that at least with the luggage that had no identification. After speaking to 5 or 6 people we explained to some one who understood what happened. They took us to lost luggage department and found our backpack that had no tags (about $3000 worth of items in luggage). We figured the other two items would make it to Huatulco. They did not. We did receive our other 2 items within 24 hours. The flights were on time going down but late leaving coming home, but on time arrival.

Turkish Airlines,4.0,Graham Thompson,18th June 2014,Flew TK041 from Johannesburg to Istanbul on 12 June. The flight was full and as a result it was one of the most cramped flights I have experienced. Not for the faint hearted. The major issue is the A330's they use on the route are old and tired. The upholstery was worn through and coming apart from the seats. Very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the world's best. There was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front. I don't think I would fly with them again - will probably take the longer route via Dubai. Emirates' seats have far more leg room on the 777's. The service itself was great it was just the planes that were awful!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Sommer Perry,10th January 2016,"I am an AAdvantage member and American Airlines credit card holder and I was just hung up on by an American Airlines supervisor. I fly monthly to weekly for work with multiple airlines. I am flying with American Airlines tomorrow from Madison to Seattle via Chicago. After my travel agent booked my flight I went onto my mobile app to select my seat. All the open seats had an up charge to select them. So, I decided to wait to get a seat assignment at check in. This morning I checked in on my mobile app. I was assigned a seat and given my boarding pass like usual. A few hours later I got on to the seat selection portion of my app. It showed the seat I was in did not recline. It also showed that all the seats except one in the back still had an up charge. So, I picked the seat in the back of the plane. After confirming my seat change I saw that the seat I had been assigned originally was a preferred seat with extra leg room and priority boarding. It also showed that to move back to that seat I was initially assigned I would have to pay an up charge. I decided to call reservations to see if there was anything I could do to keep the same seat level I'd been assigned but switch to one that reclines. This is a 4 hour flight at 5am after all. The rep said she couldn't explain what happened and couldn't help me because I was already signed in. She did say that it shouldn't have happened (all seats shouldn't have up charges and I should've been able to move seats in the cabin I was assigned). So, I decided to call the mobile app technical support line to see if they could at least tell me what happened. The tech person sent me to a supervisor who was supposed to be able to help. The supervisor listened to me explain what happened then proceeded to accuse me of lying because it didn't line up with the activity on my account. She said I would've had to pay for my original seat assignment claiming I hadn't completed my transaction and had I gone to the ""last screen"" I would've been asked for a credit card. I explained that I didn't ever ask for an upgrade and that I merely checked in and did fully check in without ever being asked for a credit card or told I had priority seating. I also told her I had the preferred seat on my boarding pass. She said that had I kept that seat and gone to the airport tomorrow, I would've been told I had to pay $68 or switch to whatever seats were left open at the back of the plane. I told her that sound strange and didn't seem like great customer service. She then asked ""what are doing right now"". I explained I was just looking for an explanation of what happened (was it an issue with my app?) and looking for someone to make me feel like a valued customer. I really wanted to understand what went wrong, I fly too much to deal with this and have never had anything like this happen before. The woman then rather heatedly announced that they are the best airline in the world. I told her our conversation wasn't demonstrating that and that the reason we were talking right now was because I wanted to give them a chance to show me that. I asked if she could just help me understand what happened and confirm the issue wasn't there for the other leg of my flight. She then told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. I was shocked. I did not use curse words or insult her. I was not screaming though I was frustrated. It was shockingly bad customer service.",,Business,Economy Class,MSN to SEA via ORD,January 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down.

This is just to compare the ticket of other EU companies who will not serve you anything unless higher class and so much more expensive ticket or on board extra purchases for snacks, and not a full meal). Fleet is super new, clean, again if compare with EU famous airlines. Looks like their high standards of service just grow and do not drop. Concerning the arrival and departure times, all is on time.

Air Canada,3.0,L Beeldman,5th June 2014,SYD-YVR and YYZ-SYD in May. The only reason these very long flights were bearable was the extra we paid for Exit row seats. I had read reviews about Exit row seats being reassigned but thankfully our seats were in order except they hardly reclined at all. AC probably charges the highest rate for Preferred seats than any other airline I have flown. The flight staff were mostly friendly another stroke of luck I believe. The IFE was not that good even though we had our own headphones the sound was very bad. The food served on both flights was the worst I have eaten on a flight in a very long time. Unappetising fridge cold bread rolls/wraps quite inedible. We had gone prepared fortunately took some snacks with us otherwise a 15 hour flight without eating could well have been the result. Ground staff in SYD were fine VR and YYZ not great. We had issues with carrying Duty free in our hand luggage on the YVR/YYZ sector because staff had not been advised of the change in rules. We were made to open our suitcases to try and fit the liquor in before the staff concerned realised she had made an error. I can say with all honesty I would not fly AC again.

This has been the worst experience ever, when it comes to boarding they should have an estimate on how many people have a carry on and there is no reason there is never space for everyoneâ€™s carry on. Also, the staff becomes rude when they start to tell you that you have to check in your bag, the problem I have with this is that they let certain people go and it becomes a personal judgement call rather than actually determining if someone has a larger carry on.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,10.0,Ash David,11th January 2015,Flew LHR to AMS then AMS to KIX Osaka. Check in at LHR was fast and efficient good fast track through customs. The lounge at T4 was clean spacious and bright. Had a very nice English breakfast. Flight to AMS was perfect considering the very high winds with no delays left and arrived on time. Skyteam lounge at Schiphol was large with plenty of comfy seating with bubbles wine and spirits and snacks. One of the nicest lounges I have visited. Again the flight on 777-200 was on time even a little early pushing back. Although the seats were the older style seats found to be quite comfortable. the recline was not as much as I hoped but still got 5 hours sleep. The staff on board were nothing but accommodating friendly and very efficient chose the Japanese menu to get me off to a good start even had great sakai on board. The return from KIX to AMS was good with a fast check in and efficient pass through customs (although no fast track was offered). The lounge is small but very comfortable with some odd seats looking out over the runway. Flight home was on a 777-300 which had better seating than on flight out. Again the staff were excellent funny and friendly. Could not ask for more. The food was well prepared tasty and very hot. The cabin was almost empty which meant could spread out. Got at least 6 hours of perfect sleep. The flight home from AMS to LHR was on KLM city hopper. Very small plane and it was packed. The seats are no different than those in economy and would in future not bother with Business on this service. To be fair flight only 45 minutes so small seat not a problem.

American Airlines,1.0,M Austin,25th December 2015,"This may have been the lousiest first class flight I've ever flown. Hubby and I boarded an overnight flight departing Los Angeles at 10:40 pm, scheduled to arrive in Tampa at 6:15 a.m. We didn't eat in the Admirals Club at LAX because we assumed we'd be served a meal, or at least a sandwich on the flight. We boarded the plane to find a substandard first class cabin. Carry-on bags barely fit into the overhead compartments. There was no lie-flat seating. There wasn't even a pillow! Seriously, on an overnight flight - no pillow in first class? Then we found out there was no food either! American cuts off food service at 10:00 pm, which is ridiculous. We'd just flown overnight with Hawaiian Air the previous night, and they served a full dinner after take-off at 1:30am. Yet American didn't even offer the traditional snack basket. We were doled out a handful of warm nuts, and a cookie. Plan on starving with American. Speaking of no bed and no food, the third ""no"" we encountered was no entertainment. During a 5-hour flight, they didn't even offer tablets. We were totally on our own. The flight attendant did inform us that, if we happened to bring our own tablet, we could purchase movies during the flight. I kid you not - in first class they want you to buy your own entertainment. Then the dingbat flight attendant failed to turn on the cabin lights for the first half hour of the flight, so we couldn't even read our own books. We sat in total darkness twiddling our thumbs. Summing up American Airlines first class cabin on a 5-hour overnight flight, there is: No lie-flat seat No pillow, No food, No snacks, No entertainment, Extended darkness. Apparently American thinks passengers should sleep on an overnight flight, since they provide barely more than a floor for us to ride on. Unfortunately they make sleeping impossible with miserably uncomfortable accommodations. Congratulations American Airlines. You win the grand prize for lousiest first class experience worldwide.

When we flew from New York to Vegas things got even worse - we had a 5-hour flight with no entertainment.

American Airlines,7.0,Neil Jeram,29th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Sydney. I really want to like and love AA! This was the return leg from LA booked on a Qantas code. Now originally I had been coming back on QF74 via SFO. However due to ATC issues in SFO three out of four flights leaving LAX were cancelled. Too their credit AA sorted the problem out and found a space on AA73 back to Sydney. That meant a bus ride back to T4 at LAX from one of the outlying terminals that AA uses. In addition a delay of 3 hours over the departure time of QF74. A separate review of the lounge at T4 but suffice to say I had a lot of time to kill. Books and phones help! Now the flight itself was on AA73 which is a B787 -9. Was keen to try this as it is the plane around which Qantas are building their future. Most if not all of my long haul is on the Airbus A380 with QF or EK. So the Boeing felt and was smaller.Ceilings were high and windows bit bigger but not as quiet as the Airbus. Being new everything had that new car feel to it! So the hard product is fine albeit I had better get used to it. It is the soft product where AA fails. On entering the craft the FA said: do I have to tell you where to go? The food service was hurried and without any real warmth. I appreciate that FA's are working in cramped conditions and so will always ask an FA how his or her day is going and smile. US crews just seem not too care, its a job for them and they just do it on auto pilot. The famed US levels of service with a smile have long since gone. The seat, 24B was a nightmare. Exit row but so narrow and uncomfortable. The Boeing 787 is probably OK for flights up to 9/10 hours but beyond that I would not take it.

Air Canada,3.0,W Johnson,17th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Seoul to Philadelphia via Toronto - this is the route I took with Air Canada, not the route that was ticketed. We were supposed to fly from Seoul (ICN) to Washington IAD via Toronto on a United code share. Our flight from Seoul left late and arrived late, which caused a missed 7:30 connection at Toronto. Our request for 2 vegetarian meals was overlooked on this 13-hour flight. The seats were fine for us because we had a 3-person section and could lift the armrests and lean against each other. The flight would have been pretty uncomfortable next to a stranger for 13 hours because the seats are quite narrow. Also, the flight was about the driest I've ever been on - I left with a very dry mouth. When we spoke with the AC personnel about trying to get back to DC, we were told that there were no flights available to anywhere in the DC area that night, direct or through connections. After AC checked with United about a possible routing that would get us to DC at 2:48 p.m. the next day, it became apparent that the routing was not available either. At this point, we discussed other options and I was told that a 9pm flight to Philadelphia was available. We took it. It was delayed 80 minutes. During this time, I booked a car rental from PHL to drop off in the DC area. By the time we left PHL, it was 1am, and I drove to our house 2 hours away, finally arriving at 3am.

United Airlines,1.0,P Saunier,2nd November 2015,"I had flown in from Amsterdam on KLM and I was connecting on a United Airlines flight into Chicago in the early afternoon around 5pm. I had plenty of time clearing both customs and enjoying the AC Maple Leaf lounge at Pearson but the United personnel at check-in failed to explain that after checking in on my UA flight I had to check the bags myself prior clearing US customs - so my bag remained in the departure area for some 4 hours without having anyone page me! 40 minutes before departure the person at the gate called my name and asked me to go back to departure to check my bag. It's useless to mention that I rushed downstairs, found my bag, missed my plane and had to clear both customs again with thousands of people waiting in line. There is something wrong with United Airlines! Why don't they tell passengers that they have to check their own bags prior clearing customs? I had a business class ticket and of course the 7:15pm flight only had economy - at least I made it to Chicago that same day but not one word of apology for misleading me or even, check my bag so that I won't miss my flight.

The Cabin manager also had a sense of humour - which is often hard to find on a long haul flight. I was fortunate enough to be sitting on the Skycouch row so was able to use the 2 seats next to me and spread out. The seats themselves I would rate about the same as any other airline.

American Airlines,1.0,Deborah Yang,20th July 2014,Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either.

Aeromexico,2.0,O Jugarech,6th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew from London to Mexico City and back with AeroMexico and had an extremely disappointing experience. I used British Airways on this route before and should not have made the mistake of changing the airline. Flight London â€“ Mexico City was delayed 17 hours. We already had boarded the plane when we were told that a technical inspection was ongoing and we would be delayed by 1 hour, then2 hours, then 2.5 hours. After 2.5 hours we were finally told that the flight wouldnâ€™t depart. Admittedly handling of the delay was quite good â€“ it took me only about 1h from disembarking to getting into a hotel room and the following day flight departed and arrived without problems. What was not so good was handling of my request for delayed flight compensation (no answer received to date). On the return leg I made the mistake of going into the AeroMexio lounge in Terminal 2. The worst airline lounge I have ever seen and my travel experience is quite extensive. When I entered the shower I thought maybe it would be better to travel not feeling fresh than risking a disease. The lounge was small, crowded and smelly. This not to mention the incompetence level at the check in â€“ I appreciate that not all counters have to be opened, but the number of open counters should be sufficient not to make business class passangers wait for 25 minutes to check in the luggage. Flight departed with only 1h delay â€“ 16h less than on the way there - progress. Half way through the flight the entertainment system and light in my seat stopped working. Flight was fully booked so there was no way to change the seat. I added AeroMexico to my â€œnever againâ€ list and would encourage everybody to do the same.",,Business,Business Class,LHR to MEX,July 2016,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,no

She refused to even look and see if anyone had been placed in our upgraded seats and insisted we had to go back to the check in counter, which was impossible at this point, to get an upgrade. We tried to clarify we had already upgraded, but the agent had not issued the correct seats. She was adamant and stubborn, to the point of extreme rudness. Her two co-workers just stood there and stared at her, but they couldn't help because obviously she had the seniority. I asked her for her name and she repeatedy refused until I raised my voice and insisted. She told me I didn't need her name.

Flight times changed and I made to contact to customer services (cannot be done on their website) to book the new time schedule. I had great trouble to understand their English. Once you book your tickets, you need to fill a form called APIS, to be able to check in and print the boarding pass. We tried this online many times, it got to a point that I wanted to cancel the flights. I had to contact their customer services but again, no luck to talk to anyone who can speak English clearly. We travelled to the airport to sort the problem and book our seats. Our flight was delayed 2 hours, found out at the airport. This caused further problem as we had a transfer flight from Istanbul to Antalya. We were dumped at the Istanbul Ataturk airport, no one there to tell us where to go or what to do. I speak Turkish so we could find our way and helped others. We needed to pass security points, walked almost 1 hour to get to the international to domestic side. But the domestic flight delayed too and we arrived there at 12:35 midnight to find that one of the luggage was left in Istanbul. We waited until 1:45 at their customer services to be told that it was not their problem, it was Istanbul. After long discussion we were told that they would send our luggage the next day. We waited all day for the luggage to arrive. It arrived at night and we wasted a day.

Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived.

Air New Zealand,2.0,H Robinson,15th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Sydney to San Francisco with Air New Zealand. First flew this airline for business in 2015 in Premium class and had a good experience. This year, four of us flew economy with my son and I in emergency row seats and my wife and daughter in a skycouch. Never again will we travel with Air New Zealand. The aircraft was delayed in Sydney so we missed the Auckland connection to SFO and were stuck 12 hours at Sydney which is one of the worst airports in the world. I have no argument with delaying an aircraft for safety reasons. However, as the hours ticked by and it became obvious that the reason the flight was delayed on the grounds that the aircraft was being cleaned proved false and there were technical problems, the counter staff became ruder and ruder in answering our questions. The lack of information was appalling. All we got were text messages every couple of hours. We finally arrived in Auckland the day after and got seats on the SFO bound flight for the 11th June and not the 10th as in the original flight. Neither my son or I got emergency row seats and the skycouch proved to be a joke. The seats are hard and abrasive and my wife and daughter didn't sleep a wink. A waste of an extra $700 for no discernible benefit. The airline is now quibbling about refunding the extra funds paid for the lack of an emergency row seat on the forward leg as I was given a 'preferred' seat on the flight from Auckland to SFO. This preferred seat was right up the back on the window. I am 188 cms tall and could not move without waking the persons in the middle and aisle seats and was extremely uncomfortable and did not sleep the entire flight.

This then made me miss my connecting flight out of LA. Instead of going straight to Columbus, I was sent to Philly. The flight attendants were rude and complained to the passengers. My final flight to Columbus was then delayed 3 hours. Instead of getting home at 5.20 pm like originally planned, I didn't get home until 1.01 am. To top it off, I had paid for a window seat on two of the planes, and was denied both this seat option and a reimbursement for it.

I have never had to deal with such unfriendly and unprofessional crew in a long haul flight (Sydney to Los Angeles). At lunch time, the flight attendant literally threw the food platter on my tray telling me ""that's pasta and that's what's left"". The rest of the crew set a mood of intimidation, unfriendliness and brashness. Not one smile, not one courteous gesture: plain rude. I was very surprised to witness that such service would still exist nowadays: a real horror story. We even requested to talk to the cabin manager to lodge a complaint but Delta does not even have a crew manager on board (or so were we told as they might back up each other).

I purposely booked a red eye that would get me in at 10 am and just got a notice saying it was changes to a 6am flight getting in late in the afternoon. Now my friend and I have paid and there's nothing we can do about it. You used to be able to go through Phoenix and have a short layover on the way down, now most flights are through LA or Dallas and have two stops instead of one.

Recently, my partner and I planned a trip to Australia for the very first time. I have never flown Air Canada ""internationally"" before so I wasn't sure what to expect. We found our check in online to be very smooth and quick the night before. The first flight from YKA to YVR was smooth like always. The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in ""Premium Economy"", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight. We arrived into SYD in the morning, feeling fairly fresh and rested from our flight. Overall, all 4 flights with Air Canada were very good. Everything was on schedule, and the staff that we interacted with were very helpful to us on our journey.

Well, flying is already not pleasant, and I am not that frequent of a flyer, about 750k miles toward the million miler, usually about 25-30kk miles a year, just under their gold tier. Here is my beef. The new basic fares where you only get half a leg credit. My company has a policy they says all of the employees must purchase the lowest published fare. Well, for American, that means basic economy. Flying on American Airlines went from bad to worse. I live in Dallas and it is tough to fly any other airline that doesnâ€™t have a connecting flight. So I am stuck... a gold member they canâ€™t select a seat, gets half credit for every flight, and just flies in misery. American should change the policy on basic fares and allow gold members or higher to at least be able to select seats.

Our flight was delayed for something like two hours because of United's incompetence and inability to have a plane and crew ready for a scheduled flight. When the plane finally arrived at about 23:40 (the scheduled departure was 22:06), we were put onto a bus that drove us 50 or 100 yards (walking distance) onto the tarmac. We were then stranded in the bus for 35 minutes with no explanation, and not allowed to get off the bus. In other words, United doubled down on its incompetence and unreliability by further inconveniencing its passengers by directing them to board a bus and then demonstrating what I construe as willful and intentional contempt for the passengers by stranding them in the bus with no explanation. I recall that one person had to ask to use the toilet before the flight left because, even though most people probably did so before being told to board, the delay due to the airline's incompetence and disregard for its customers resulted in the need to do so again.",,Business,Economy Class,EWR to AVP,March 2016,2.0,5.0,,,3.0,2.0,no

Air New Zealand,1.0,A Macindoe,18th March 2015,Travelled from London to Auckland. Having lived in London for the last 11 years I was on a flight moving back to New Zealand permanently. Flew with Singapore Airlines on SQ317 from London to Singapore and had excellent service the whole way. The flight attendants were friendly food was served quickly and was delicious trays were removed quickly and we were constantly provided refreshments. At the beginning of the flight my sister was having problems with her entertainment console so the attendant offered to re-boot the system. it was done immediately and they checked after a couple of minutes that it was working. It happened a couple of times during the flights so the attendant gave her a voucher to use towards a duty free item which was a very kind gesture. However our onwards flight from Singapore to Auckland was extremely disappointing and one of the worst long haul flights I have been on. Most of the flight attendants were very friendly (I did hear one tell a traveller that they couldn't fix their console as they were about to serve food which seemed very unhelpful) however their service was extremely lacking. Shortly after taking off we discovered that our entertainment consoles were not working properly but either continually freezing or losing sound. We pressed the buzzer for a flight attendant but after waiting 10 mins and watching them walk past us a couple of times we had to ask them in person for assistance. Rather than offer to re-boot the consoles as Singapore Airlines had done we were informed that they had been aware of the problem in Singapore but were unable to fix it until they got to Auckland. For a passenger on a 9 hour flight who has already travelled on a 12 hour flight just beforehand this was very disappointing news. We were both transferred to other seats (seated separately) however the cabin was so cold further forward that I ended up returning to my original seat. The service and quality of the food was also very disappointing. The chicken dinner we were served was very salty and the breakfast omelette was rubbery. The chicken sausage accompanying it was inedible. The attendants were also extremely slow with clearing the trays in comparison to Singapore Airlines. My sister is has Gold airpoints status so we had priority labels on our luggage however we were one of the last to get our luggage upon arrival in Auckland. Overall it was an extremely disappointing and frustrating flight.

Southwest Airlines,8.0,Carol Joseloff,8th July 2015,"Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane.

Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,Ronald Knight,10th December 2014,In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar.

Emirates,1.0,G Macino,6th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch, ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140â‚¬ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline, great staff, great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service, rude crew, poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work.

The original flight out of St John's left 1.5 hours after scheduled departure although the status was not delayed and we boarded reasonably on time. Landed in Halifax and got back onto the same plane to go to Boston after clearing US customs. Got to Boston and my bag had not made it out of Halifax although both of my husband's bags made it. We filed a delayed baggage report with the Air Canada baggage office in Boston on 1 Jan 2019 - same day as our flight. We flew on to Las Vegas and were informed that the bag would be routed to us within 2 days. It is now day 4 on the 4 Jan 2019 and we still have no bag. We have spoken to at least ten different people on the phone number provided for Air Canada delayed baggage. Turns out we are dealing with a call centre where there are no clear lines of communication as we have now been told about five different versions of where my bag is. We decided to get in a cab and go to Las Vegas airport to see if we could find out more information. Air Canada have a shared baggage office managed by a different company. They told us the bag was no in Toronto and most definitely not arrived in Vegas on 3 Jan 2019 when it was supposed to reach us. We called the delayed baggage number again and actually ended up giving the phone to one of the staff at the office because the guy on the phone was adamant our bag arrived in Vegas - turns out he was wrong. We are due to fly home to Australia on 4 Jan 2019 so gave numerous instructions to now get the bag to our home address - we verified that this information was on my file reference on the World Tracer website - great we can see the information on there, my bag might get home! Oh wait we just called Air Canada delayed baggage hotline and have been informed it is now going back to Boston from Toronto and is not scheduled further than that. Now we have already told these people numerous times we don't live in Boston. So after giving clear instructions again for at least the fifth time that the bag needs to now get to Australia, we are still in limbo. It is impossible to actually speak to someone directly at Air Canada because they have made themselves fantastic at being unreachable - no email addresses or phone contact numbers. The delayed baggage call centre cannot communicate accurate information and don't know anything but those are the only people you can speak to. We fly regularly every year and have used many different airlines. Never have I experienced anything like this.

Yet the plane is still sitting at the terminal. Not to mention this is the last flight out of this terminal and the last one coming in. I know as I stayed there till 1am trying to get my problem solved with them. No one in customer services actually knows what that is at Dallas Fort Worth airport. Rude and care nothing about their customers. The best part is when we got to customer service they had three people working. When a line started up 2 of those 3 people just left. Leaving one person to deal with everything. Then when you ask to speak to a manager. They make you wait an hour until a flight attendant shows you were they are one gate over. As you stand there waiting to speak with them. They act like you are not even there. Typing away on the computer until you do something to really get the attention of them. Then they say well you can fly out tomorrow at 7.30 but we can do nothing else. So you call a 800 number and they tell you how they should pay for your hotel, food for the night/breakfast and get you to and from the airport/hotel and back.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Rohith Jayawardene,15th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight.

This will put us in Chicago too late to make our connection. This means we cannot fly out till the next morning. United will not give us a voucher for anything because the delay was not 4 or more hrs. I looked at Denver weather radar and there is no bad weather. Gate people keep saying bad weather. Maybe there was down the line but not in Denver as they are insisting. So they don't have to supply vouchers for this late leg. The week prior I was booked on flight out of Houston.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Smith Amy,28th August 2014,Flew Nairobi-IST-Boston return. While aircraft and cabin were fine food definitely above average and a bird strike was professionally and safely handled by the pilot (take off aborted switch to new aircraft) I was not happy with the following: 1) Very difficult to get hold of Turkish Airlines office by phone. I wanted to inquire about changes to my ticket. In Nairobi I had to end up making the journey to their downtown office in person because no one answered the phone. In the US it was equally difficult to get hold of anyone who could help with ticket changes. You can also only pay any change fees in person at the airport (this alone took an hour prior to the actual check in and ended up being USD 80 higher than originally advised). In Boston there is also no on- line check in available. Turkish is just not equipped with the kind of services that makes this much easier with airlines like KLM BA Delta etc. 2) Horrible experience at Istanbul airport. Again wanted to go to a ticket office to inquire about changes during my layover. In the entire international transit area there is none! It was also incredibly difficult just to find someone who spoke adequate English! After going in circles I was finally told I need to get a visa exit the airport go to the ticket office outside then re-enter! It was also by far the dirtiest airport I have been to hardly saw cleaning crews and if I did they were standing around talking rather than working. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew particularly friendly on a four leg trip one flight attendant stood out for trying to be particularly helpful. I had chosen Turkish because at the time it was the cheapest option the few hundred dollars saved were not worth it because of the other hassles gained.

On our return, we flew into Laguardia and waited to board our last flight to finally get home, when we were told there was a medical emergency on board and the plane would be late. As time went by the reason was quickly changed to bad weather so that the airline would not be responsible for any expenses they would have to pay out to their customers. Most of us were rerouted the next morning at 6:00am first bound for Atlanta, and then returning north to our final destination. I can't tell you how many passengers were left without a place to go, (they told us the terminal would be closed overnight,) and when we asked for food vouchers and water, we were all told that ""Delta no longer provides these things for their customers when flights are cancelled."" Had they not told their usual lies, many of us could have helped ourselves before it was too late. With a whole lot of angry people demanding answers, I would have hated to be the one behind the counter. We all asked to speak to the supervisor - she was of no help whatsoever.

Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit.

They stuff as many passengers on a plane without regard to their comfort at all. It seems after every terrible flight I fly with Delta, the seats and leg space get smaller and smaller.

They nickle and dime you for everything and even have a scam to try and get people to pay extra for seats they could have for free. They have a ridiculous charge of $75 if you wish to switch to an earlier flight, which is crazy considering the fact that the seats are already available. They claim to have free WiFi on board but it has not worked on a single Delta flight I have been on. Do not fly Delta if you can avoid.

Lufthansa,3.0,K Nyman Metcalf,24th July 2015,"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not LufthansaÂ´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment.",,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Tallinn via Frankfurt,July 2015,4.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,3.0,no

This flight was advertised on the UA website and even on the boarding pass as new United Polaris Business Class, with ""Redesigned seating, luxury bedding and calming amenities offer the ultimate comfort for relaxation and sleep"". My expectations were quite high. You cannot believe my disappointment and disgust when I boarded the plane and found out the business class cabin was most outdated and terrible business class I have ever seen. The seats were incredible old, tired and dirty. There was no access to the isle for every seat. There were scratches, dents and dints everywhere in the cabin. The crew was working in the galleys without any curtain to the cabin. So we had the full galley light in the cabin at all time. Toilets were outdated. They were clean but the bins very completely full soon and have not been emptied during the flight. There was no mouth wash, hand cream, toothpaste, combs or anything similar which is standard for all other decent airlines. The food was kind of okay",,,,,,,,,,,,
United Airlines,1.0,D Edwards,18th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Absolute worst airline I've ever flown with. I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate. Absolute swindle. You buy a cheap flight because you can afford it, but then you have to pay extra for something every other basic airline ticket allows you to have.

Service - Before take off the staff brought drinks like champagne and orange juice, and my wife asked for a ginger ale. Staff initially brought sprite by mistake and then forgot about it. When my wife asked for ginger ale again she was told we cannot serve on ground. Initially we were not given the menu. When I complained they brought it. And then they took away my wife's food menu by mistake. Every time she asked for a menu - staff did a horrible job explaining what's available instead of giving a menu. In the morning she asked for omelette and was still given crepes. Everyone else was given 3 choices for breakfast. But some like myself were given 2. This is how inconsistent the service was.

To find some sleep in this narrow situation is difficult. The legroom in the extra legroom economy is fine and the recline of the seat helps. In my opinion this is worth the money. The new entertainment system in the 777-200 was fine and they had a nice collection of films and shows. The flight attendants were friendly and nice. Boarding in Cape Town as complicated and inefficient. There is so much space in the hall but they have to do it right in the smallest corner. The passengers are getting pushed around like cattle and nobody knows what is going on. The flight from Amsterdam to Berlin was fine - not special, just a flight between two cities. However, the cramped economy seats on the Boeing 777-200 makes it difficult to recommend KLM.",Boeing 777-200 / E90,Business,Economy Class,CPT to TXL via AMS,December 2015,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Carry on's excessive and large. The option to have carry on's stowed while waiting at the gate was unfair to those who had to pay to stow luggage. It was obvious that most of the carry on did not meet the regulations. Way too much luggage brought onto cabin. Very time consuming waiting for people to find a place to store luggage. The flight was uncomfortable. Seats are not large enough for most people to sit comfortably. Nothing complimentary offered other than water, other food and beverages to purchase. On a 5 hour flight I think free juice/coffee should be offered.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Anchorage to Toronto via Vancouver,June 2015,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Josiah Malychewski,23rd November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Portland to Houston. We planned a normal flight and didn't realize there was a difference from ""basic economy"" and economy (let it be known when leaving this review there isn't even an option for ""basic economy"", just first class, business class, premium economy, and economy), and when I arrived for my flight I was forced to check my bag because a carry on and a personal item are not included, only a personal item. This forced me to pay an additional $30 for my already expensive flight. I would not recommend this airline to anyone unless they are planning a short trip where they don't need to pack actual cloths, otherwise you'll be blindsided by the additional fee(s). I've flown with several airlines and have never checked a bag, all other airlines allow a personal item and carry on.

Air Canada,3.0,Julien Marin,18th February 2014,Just flew with Air Canada Rouge for the first time. I've been a dedicated Air Canada flyer for many years with Status alternating between Elite and Super Elite. Rouge is a big step down for their regular flight service: reduced legroom uncomfortable chairs inexperienced flight attendants. The lady next to me was not able to be served in French so I had to act as the translator for the attendants this was unacceptable! The Entertainment system changed to an App or browser-based system. I'm not opposed to this but it would be much better if they provided a system on which I can mount my tablet rather than staring down at the table-top the whole flight. Moreover if you have an Ipad you will need to download the app ahead of the flight (or have the Google Chrome browser installed) otherwise you won't be able to view movies onboard. TV viewing will still work through the regular browser (not sure why TV and Movie streaming would be all that different but anyhow). They should offer the capability of downloading the require app (or Chrome) from the plane's entertainment system directly.

United Airlines,2.0,Jane Hirst,7th September 2015,"We boarded our aircraft early for our 09.25 flight to New York for our 4 day break. At 09.10 we were told there was a technical problem. We sat on the plane for over 4 hours with only 2 crackers and half a glass of water served. Eventually we were told to leave the plane and ground staff would give us further instructions. The ground staff hadn't even been told we were leaving the plane. Eventually after collecting our luggage we were put on a bus to an awful hotel. We were collected by bus the following morning and taken back to the airport. A member of staff was handing out airline compensation forms, but when we asked if the plane was fixed, she snapped not to harass her as she had worked a double shift and was stressed. When we said we were stressed and just wanted to know if we would be travelling that day, she called over security who threatened if there was any problems, he controlled who got on the plane and who didn't. Disgraceful behaviour to everyone who were now delayed 24 hours. We eventually arrived in New York 26 hours late and in rush hour, so our 4 days was reduced to 2! United Airlines have since sent an email offering compensation but the 2nd page with all the information was missing so none the wiser but I'm guessing judging by previous reviews it will be a travel voucher.

American Airlines,1.0,Harold Bush-Howard,7th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Miami to San Francisco. Service is well below normal standard, even in what they call First Class. On approachong American Airlines flagship check in at Miami I was told by female employee to go 'over there' where the economy check-in was. I continued and asked her why did she assume I was not entitled to check in there. She said she had to make sure not everyone try to check in there as it was for First class passengers only. Well, I was travelling First and I am a BA Gold Card holder (Emerald in Oneworld) so I was doubly entitled to check in there. Very off-putting for an employee to do this. Worse was to come. The so-called First class is anything but First class, apart from the seat which was comfortable. No welcome. Pre-departure drinks were not cleared. Moody flight attendants. No hand cream in toilets. No breakfast worth having (only two quiches, the one I had was very bland and soggy). No bread was offered, just sweet cookies. I deliberately did not eat anything in the lounge hoping for a good First class breakfast. If I had brought a McDonald's meal I would have been more satisfied. Entertainment was a table. In 21st century America? Why do we pay so much money to travel with them if they offer so little? American is a rip off. They claim they are changing.

United Airlines,3.0,Vitalij Zabelo,18th February 2015,"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not. Since United has obviously different point of view in this regard I will avoid flying them next time.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,no

Qatar Airways,9.0,Marwan Kumar,14th June 2016,"Manchester to Islamabad via Doha with Qatar Airways. A very pleasant flight Manchester to Doha - excellent cabin crew service. Due to light load plenty of rows were empty and pax were able to lie flat if they so wished. A7-BAX was a new aircraft and the new type of seats were found to be much more comfortable than the earlier ones. Flight departure was on schedule and arrived early which gave us a comfortable time-gap to transfer to another flight. For lunch there were 3 options and the ones we ordered were very palatable, snacks were readily available throughout the flight. The transfer service at Doha airport was exceptionally good - we had requested wheel chairs and were provided electric 'buggies' from one end of the terminal [B] to end of terminal C and so onto terminal D as well as being escorted onto the bus and up to the aircraft door - we experienced no hassle at all and would like to thank Qatar Airways ground staff and Doha airport. The flight from Doha to Islamabad was operated by an A320 A7-ADG a mid-aged aircraft, however the cabin was well maintained and the washrooms were clean - we found this surprising as our experience on this sector has been somewhat different on other airlines. The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry.

Aegean Airlines,5.0,K Martin,23rd January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I flew from Athens to London Heathrow in Business Class. I have flown with Aegean many times before, mostly in Business Class and their service has been consistently good. On this occasion though there were problems. Aegean offer 4 free seat upgrades to their Gold flyers and 2 upgrades to their Silver flyers. This means a lot of passengers flying Business class for ""free"". On my flight there were 16 passengers in C class, 50% of which were free upgrades. One FA only was assigned to this cabin and as a result the service was far below expectations. The FA could not provide the service required on time or at the level it should be. For example, drinks were coming very slowly and the starter and main were served at the same time which is very unusual for Aegean on this route. By the time I finished my starter, the main was too cold. Also, passengers in C class were putting their feet up on the back of the front seat with the FA allowing it without any sort of comment. Certainly not a good experience this time. I have flown many times with Aegean, I recommend them and I consider them one of the best airlines in Europe. However, if they want to take the extra step and get another star they need to sort out some small things like these upgrades. Maybe reduce them? Do they need them for Silver members? During busy times, their C cabin needs more than one staff to keep up with the workload. I will be flying with them again soon though.",A321,Business,Business Class,Athens to London Heathrow,January 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,3.0,yes
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,Alan Tang,25th November 2014,KL1602 (FCO-AMS): I would describe the whole experience as efficient yet comfortable. As this is a short flight (2 hours) the crew managed to make the flight pleasant. The service was offered twice the first with sandwich with cheese and selection of drinks (hot beverages and soft drinks) and followed with tea and coffee with biscuits. Crew were nice and helpful for the full flight and noticed how they are really aware on recycling meal packaging after meal service was completed. Totally recommend KLM for the regional Europe flights as they have managed to make the flight comfortable and seamless.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,yes

This was my first long haul flight in a few years, we arrived very late at the airport and only had a few minutes until check in closed. The Qatar Airways staff were waiting for us as we were the last passengers to check in, we were very short on time and the staff escorted us to the security check and managed to get us fast tracked through security so we didn't miss our flight. We boarded the plane and were greeted by the nicest crew I have encountered on a flight. Our first leg of our flight was roughly 7 hours to Doha. The plane was clean and very stylish throughout each seating class. Shortly after take off we were served breakfast which consisted the most amazing meal on an airline. We were served Waffles with strawberries and cream, We also received a hot bread roll, fruit salad, yogurt, water and fresh juice and coffee. After we were served our meal, the cabin was cleared of the breakfast and we could sit back and relax. The inflight entertainment system was great and had hundreds of movies, TV Shows, music, games to keep you happy for the long flight. A few hours into the flight we were served lunch. The food on this airline is some of best. We landed in Doha with a short 4 hour layover which was just enough to explore Qatar Airways hub airport which is a fantastic place. The flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur was to the same high standards and we arrived in Kuala Lumpur feeling relaxed and refreshed.

American Airlines,1.0,H Walker,9th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York JFK to Manchester. American Airlines is probably the worst airline I've ever flown with. After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers. Awful, avoid American Airlines.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Manchester,July 2017,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,J Oben,12th December 2013,Thursday evening they cancelled my son's flight to DFW (due to weather) I held on the phone for 1.5 hours and even though he was flying as an unaccompanied minor and they could see I was on another flight to a foreign country at the time they wanted me to pick him up and take him back to the airport later. My friends husband came to the airport to take my son so he could then take him to his new 2pm flight. I waited in line at the airport I was flying out from for a gate agent to fill out the paperwork pay the extra fee etc. but no one was even at work at the gate. I have to fill out paperwork for my son pay and still get to my own flight and through security. My son was put on a flight for that afternoon then makes it to Dallas. Today I come back to the country and when attempting to board my flight from MIA to DFW I am told I can't take my bag on that has already been on 4 American Flights since Friday. They called final boarding. She proceeded to tell me now I wouldn't be getting on that flight. The supervisor eventually put me on a standby flight for 6.50 am since I missed the 8.35 pm flight I was supposed to be on the night before. They told me I was welcome to sleep in the terminal.

As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Ashwin Swar,15th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through.

The most positive things I can say about my United Airlines experience were that I made my connections and my bags arrived in the right place on time. There it stops. Why are United using antique 767s on the London - Newark route? They are uncomfortable, the noisiest aircraft I have ever travelled on, the food was basically inedible. As for IFE, I think I would have been less offended if there was none. Minute screen, and only a choice of 5 or so films, which played on a loop so if you missed the start or - heaven forbid - wanted to go to the bathroom, then tough luck, you've missed part of the film. Cabin staff were friendly. On arrival at Newark, I was pleasantly surprised to make my connection between terminals in under two hours. However, like their planes, the circle of hell that is the United gates at Terminal A desperately needs dragging into the 21st century.

American Airlines,1.0,ML Simonetto,16th November 2018,"Not Verified | I had a horrible experience flying back from Boston to Miami with American Airlines. The flight that was supposed to leave at 6pm got first delayed to 7.15pm: I literally saw the plane that was supposed to be the one that would have taken us to Miami, be given to the people in the 4.50pm flight from Boston to Miami. After that, we were told we were waiting for a flight from Philadelphia to get to Boston and they would have boarded us there. Well, the plane got to Boston at 7.45pm but we couldnâ€™t board for â€œweather-related problemsâ€ when the reality was that the crew wasnâ€™t there. Well some crew members got to the airport and boarded the 4.50pm flight that was waiting in the parking since 6pm. We were told that another crew was on their way and our flight would have taken off at 10pm. At 10.30pm we were told we wouldnâ€™t be able to go to Miami and our flight was cancelled. No refund, no hotel provided because it was â€œweather relatedâ€ when really it was because American Airlines couldnâ€™t get the crew to the airport. At that point it wasnâ€™t even raining in Boston. If this wasnâ€™t enough, the personnel at the desk was incredibly rude. They lied to us multiple times regarding the status of the flight, they told us the problem was the weather when all the other flights were taking off from Boston, just not to provide us with reimbursement. When I asked them to be put on a flight for Miami ASAP since my pet was at home alone they told me â€œwell, pray this flight is leaving because we donâ€™t have any tool for tomorrowâ€.

Second leg from Istanbul to San Francisco was a delayed departure. I looked around the Turkish Airlines lounge at Istanbul and it is as described, two floors, huge, lots going on, lots of food service. However, if flying Turkish Airlines you are going to get lots of food on the plane anyway so probably most helpful if you are using the lounge when flying nonbiz and have a pass/status. I personally prefer a smaller, quieter lounge but there's definitely the service here. Security for the connection to SFO from IST was heavier, including carry on search/testing and wanding everyone at the gate, so allow plenty of time at the gate.

After a rushed flight from Nice to Amsterdam we were left with only 45 minutes, but I wanted to have a freshen-up in the lounge. The airport is chaotic, but the KLM lounge was worse. I have never seen so many people in such a crowded space. You canâ€™t find any decent seats and then there isnâ€™t any space between chairs. After a quick coffee and a toilet break we left for the boarding gate. Well, even worse - there is a long queue for passport control. When we got to the gate it was already boarding time. The 777 was ok. Slightly angled seats with a tiny tiny foothold. I am 5.6 and my feet barely fit in it. When flat the bed is comfy but one has to angle ones feet sideways. The blanket is soft and warm. Service was very efficient but at times I couldnâ€™t find any staff. Since it was a daylight flight I had to watch TV and eat. Food wasnâ€™t great - beef curry was a reconstituted shredded beef without any flavour. The other choices were worse. Drinks were good. The pre-arrival snack was a dec3nt hamburger but it was cold. The amenity kit was poor - worse than most economy class. Just a pair of sock, toothbrush and toothpaste. And an eyeshade. We had a 1.5 hour delay due to a technical issue, which is not the airlineâ€™s fault, but still, they didnâ€™t give us any drinks or snacks until after an hour. All in all, KLM has a lot to catch up on, even just within its group, to Air Feanceâ€™s standard. We flew AF in March, also business class, and it is a much superior airline.

Delta Air Lines,10.0,Logan Tresso,6th May 2014,Flying to Detroit From Tampa on a 737-800. Service on the plane: it was a good experience. Flight Attendants were polite and cared about me and other passengers (unlike United and BA). Food was only pretzels and cookies and a drink of choice (it was only a 2hr flight).

Delta Air Lines,,J Katnic,4th May 2014,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,no

Air New Zealand,8.0,G Graham,12th August 2013,Los Angeles to Auckland. Our return flight was from Auckland to San Francisco. We have always liked ANZ! On our flight to Auckland we were on the 777-300ER in seats 23A/B. This was our first experience with the newer premium economy service. By all counts it was excellent and would definitely use this class of service again! The seats were comfortable the service and meals were excellent too! On our return flight we flew on the 747 in premium economy - older style - seats 22 H/K. We enjoy the fact that these seats are on the upper level of the 747. These seats are more like standard seats and not as comfortable as the 777 seats. We had room to spread out with no seats directly in front of us. Unfortunately the service was poor during this flight. The FA mentioned that they were missing a staff member for this flight. No matter we still favor ANZ and we would select and recommend the premium economy seats of 777 over the 747 if at all possible.,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes
Jetblue Airways,1.0,K Kamholz,6th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Booked to fly Jetblue Airways from Boston to Buffalo. When the flight was cancelled due to weather the manager refused to accomodate my serious disability. He wouldnâ€™t accept (or even let me present) my medical document proving my disability and was all around disinterested in the fact that I have this disability. Apparently they cannot make accommodations for someone if a flight is cancelled due to weather even if they are legitimately disabled. I am severely disappointed and disturbed. Even after 2 hours on the phone with corporate they cannot do anything to accommodate my disability, because it was a weather cancellation. Apparently if it was cancelled another way they would have been able to. How is having a documented medical disability not an accepted extenuating circumstance? I am downright flabbergasted at the lack of empathy and customer service. All they can provide me with is a cot, of which I am larger than, without pillows or blankets.

American Airlines,1.0,J Horne,5th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Dallas to Birmingham, AL. I performed a same day reservation change to a later flight in the day. I was charged $75 for the change. I tried to check in online 90 minutes prior to departure three times with no success. I called customer service and asked them for assistance and they said you can only check in online and at the airport. I arrived to the ticket counter 30 minutes prior to my flight and she said this is odd, I can see you are on this flight but there are no seats. I asked how that could be. She even called a coworker over and they said all we can do is put you on standby for the next flight. I was pretty upset and proceeded through security to the gate arriving 15 minutes prior to departure time. I asked the girl at the gate counter why my seat was given away and she called a gentleman over and they whispered as they looked on the screen. She asked him if she should pull ""her"" from the plane. She then closed the door and locked it. He stood there as if I should just walk off gingerly. I debated with him about why their antics were bad business and his only come back was that I should have checked in earlier. I said like 90 minutes earlier like I tried to do. Not everyone can be at the gate 2 hours prior to a flight. This is 2016 - that's what technology is for which American Airlines is obviously struggling with. Not to mention customer service. I called customer service again, this time speaking to an agent who was nice but obviously thought her level of kindness was equaled by my ignorance. She put me on hold for a few minutes after hearing my story and has the audacity to come back and say I got you on the 8:15 flight. I asked the flight I'm already on after getting dumped on by your company? She said it's the least I can do. I said what about a refund or a voucher or waiving the $75 I had to pay for a flight you gave my seat away on which had I known was going to happen would have never changed to? She said I'm afraid I can't do anything sir. This is all comical now but being a business guy I can see huge inefficiencies in operations and customer service. So in all honesty I would not fly American Airlines. I know I won't. There are too many other options - companies who wouldn't treat their customers in this manner.",,Business,Economy Class,DFW to BHM,November 2016,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,no

I understood from the crew that Emirates has a new policy to overbook the economy class and upgrade all remaining passengers to Business class. That is what happened on the both mentioned flights, more than 50% passengers got free upgrades to Business. So C class was totally full on the huge A380 results in poor service because the FAs were totally overloaded with this high amount of people. On the flight from Frankfurt to Dubai I had to wait more than 3 hours until they served the dinner. Further I think this is also very unfair for the passengers who paid the business class fare. It seems that the airline is good for economy passengers but sorry Emirates this is not what business people paying a very high fare do expect.",A380,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Bangkok via Dubai,November 2017,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,no

Things started on a sour note when my flight was caught up in their Boeing 787 repair fiasco, resulting in a change of equipment and schedule. This resulted in me having to forfeit my connecting AA flight in IAH (to MIA) due to the much later arrival time. Air NZ stubbornly refused to compensate me for this so I had to suck it up and purchase a brand new flight. I must say that the Premium check-in area at AKL made me feel special. I have to comment though on the seating in Business Premier - who signed off on this design and lay-out (herringbone)? Unable to glance out of the window and feet facing towards the aisle. The seating pods had the dubious honour of feeling both enclosed and claustrophobic, yet without any sense of privacy. The food was also disappointing with virtually the same menu as the MEL - AKL sector, with really small portions. Lastly, making your Business customers pay for WiFi was just plain mean. Sorry Air NZ, I so wanted my trip to be awesome but it disappointed on many levels.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,K Leng,21st February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasnâ€™t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasnâ€™t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, Iâ€™ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything thatâ€™s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlinesâ€™ fault and that they didnâ€™t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. Iâ€™ve tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time Iâ€™ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me theyâ€™ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but itâ€™s been 2 months now and I havenâ€™t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didnâ€™t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that theyâ€™ll fully refund me, but arenâ€™t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what Iâ€™ve been through. Itâ€™s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews).

Qatar Airways,4.0,J Deerlin,15th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Melbourne to Geneva via Doha and Marrakesh to Melbourne on return. Despite good ground service in Geneva and Marrakesh, service was shocking in Qatar. Despite arriving into Qatar from Melbourne with an hour to spare we were not able to board the flight due to their systems. Continued confusion at the airport (after queuing for 20 minutes) meant we were told 3 times we would make the flight, only to be told in the end that we could not. They did re-route us via Geneva and London to Edinburgh, but then there was not enough time for the required connection (this was always going to be impossible). So again we had to re-route, this time via a different London flight and on to Aberdeen instead. Our 22 hour journey ended up being through 5 airports, 42 hours long and we didn't manage to have time for one lounge due to all the continued queuing and waiting. As a shorty (5ft 1) the headrests are badly designed. They push my head forward uncomfortably as they don't go low enough. At least the staff got me extra blankets to sit on, which really did help my neck a lot but was not the comfiest for my bum. There is no foot rest, again a problem for me being short. I tried to use my own Bose headphones with a 2 pin adapter as I do on most flights but with only 4 volume settings and the volume down to its lowest it was unbearably loud. I asked for a headset and got through 4 headsets, not one worked properly. One ear only would work on 3 pairs and with the other it was a robotic sound and I could not hear properly. I ended up using my own headphones but only half on my ears. My handset flashed the entire journey which was very offputting. They tried to re-set it 3 times, but it did not help. For one of the legs I was in an exit row and the handsets are next to your hip which meant I kept pressing the buttons without meaning to, interrupting my movie by randomly selecting a game for example. Food and drink I cannot fault - probably the best airline food I've had in economy.

Could not have asked for better service. On the return trip passenger assistance did not want to know about us. KLM staff in Moscow messed up the luggage and told us they couldn't send it from Moscow all the way through to Brisbane so we had to find it at Schiphol with an 18-hour lay-over and manage it ourselves. One staff member took pity on us and checked our luggage in overnight. Had to beg to have use of the buggy to get to China Southern for departure back to China en route to Brisbane. Although all of this was booked from Brisbane and re-checked all along the way and we had such a good feeling about KLM we felt the attitude of most of the staff was brusque and not helpful.

We flew to Montego Bay from Killeen Tx and when we arrived, our luggage did not. It would've been ok if they were courteous and respectful but they were horrible. We arrived at Montego Bay at 3.55pm and didn't get to speak with anyone about our luggage until 6.15 pm because the person who was suppose to be at our counter (AA) was ""busy assisting someone else"" as they kept telling us. When we did speak with someone, they informed me that our luggage was still in Dallas but will arrive first thing in the morning. We were excited to hear that and continued on to our resort. First thing in the morning came and went, afternoon came and went, evening came and went. We had the hotel call the airport (we tried calling ourselves but the room phone wouldn't properly dial out the 800 number) they were told the luggage would be here soon. Our luggage came at 11 pm the second night we were there. Our vacation was only for 6 days, two days have already passed when we received it. No one knows why we didn't get it until and when the resort called they kept lying (AA representative) and said it was already on its way and would be here in two hours. We heard two hours for two days. Fast forward 8 days. We used AA once again for our trip to Aruba which was 8 days after this first disaster. When we go to check in (again first class/business class) the airline double booked us and had us flying to multiple locations. AA rep informed us we would have to check in at counter. We went to check in at the counter and it took us TWO hours, yes two hours to fix our reservations. I am traveling with my SO who is a disabled veteran (we both are veterans) who was told he had to stand those two hours because they didn't have a wheelchair available for him. It takes AA two hours to issue us tickets and then they change our flights making our stay in Aruba airport 4 hours. When I expressed how disappointed we were the AA rep informed me that this is the norm for AA. He said we shouldn't be complaining about only waiting two hours to get our tickets printed. He was rude along with the manager who kept talking in Spanish.

Lufthansa,2.0,P Bell,13th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | I had heard good things about Lufthansa's business class and selected them for this flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt. I regret the decision. The worst feature is the extremely narrow seat. I'm not large but found it to be a tight fit around the shoulders. Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor. I only wanted a snack for dinner on a midnight departure and chose a Thai prawn appetiser (dry and miserable) and some cheese (dreary but edible) With so many other great business class choices available, it's extremely unlikely I would choose Lufthansa again.",A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Frankfurt,March 2018,1.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,1.0,no

Freedom to choose seats after takeoff as long as we were in the back of the plane. Cabin crew were excellent. Doha to Chennai-plane was fairly full but again an aisle seat by choice. Aircraft was an A330 not as nice as the 777. Evening meal was served quickly, food was average and arrived in Chennai on schedule at 2 am. Return legs a 4am departure from Mumbai, get there early as Mumbai is chaos - on 777-fairly full flight but crew were pleasant enough. Breakfast served which was quite good. Landed in Doha late which meant connecting to the Heathrow flight was a rush. We landed at gate 20 and the plane for UK departed from Gate 1 so it was a mad rush but the ground staff saw me and informed the gate staff that I was late. On board flight fairly full, somebody was in my seat and refused to move but the senior cabin crew guy took me off to near the front of the plane and found me a better seat -still in economy but aisle/window choice - good and alert response to the situation.

Cabin service was excellent with the dine on demand feature welcome, we had eaten in Doha airport so weren't too hungry on the way out. Seats were comfortable with room to get round the fully reclined seat of neighbouring passenger. Plenty of leg and arm room and the food and drink on offer was good. Managed to sleep for part of the journey and enjoyed the flight. The return journey was also very good with excellent service from the cabin services director. Due to feeling unwell I did not take any food but was kept well supplied with water by the cabin crew. On both flights the toilets were kept very clean and well stocked. Both flights departed on time, although when leaving Bali we were delayed at the runway access for 20 minutes waiting for an incoming flight.

United Airlines,1.0,Filsone Tony,8th August 2014,United Airlines business or first class to Aruba is very bad. Misleading advertising service and claimed equipment is false. No inflight entertainment as advertised. No video or music in First Class. Seats tray and pockets all dirty with food and garbage from last passenger. This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,N Allen,3rd August 2014,It is too bad the people that seem to post on the web are the ones that have had poor experiences. I fly almost weekly on Southwest for the last 6 years. It is with trepidation that I fly other airlines as you never know what you are going to get-especially Delta. The customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable. Unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats. Rarely are they late. The staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily. Airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees. Plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive. Airline miles are so easy to use including international. This airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service. Definitely a loyal fan and steady customer!,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes

United Airlines,5.0,B Upham,27th August 2015,"Outbound EWR-LHR was a ""United"" Crew and service was fairly attentive to a full cabin. United has set up Biz Class in the B-767-300's as half the seats facing f'wd and half aft. Entertainment systems are set up in groups of four, two in each direction. Which means seat partners face in same direction. Although fairly tight for business class, lie-flat seats are comfortable. Food was average for an Atlantic run (nobody beats Aer Lingus) and timekeeping accurate. Return run was with a ""Continental"" crew on B-777 (No. 0001, the ""Gordon Bethune"" -wonder if they've got one named after Frank Lorenzo, LOL) with only two classes (Biz First and Coach), and service was first rate.

The seat was reasonably comfortable even though it did not recline very much. Also the seats are not too close to the seats in front as on some airline. The inflight entertainment was fantastic (much better than on Virgin Atlantic which was so antiquated) with many choices.

Air New Zealand,7.0,L Pearce,19th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Auckland to Sydney with Air New Zealand. The trip started off with the Premium Check In area, which did not seem premium in any way because all I saw was the Ground Crew just directing people, not actually checking passengers into their flights. After the security, I gave the Lounge a visit and enjoyed breakfast. Boarding time did not match the boarding pass, with priority boarding not enforced which meant passengers were all over the place. A very warm welcome by the Cabin Crew once onboard with a welcome drink on offer straight away. I decided to have a second breakfast once airborne and the food selection was very good. From what I observed, I find the crew very engaging, hospitable and friendly which was a big difference from my recent trips with Virgin and Qantas.

Qatar Airways,10.0,Brian McCaig,13th July 2015,"A few years ago, I took advantage of a special offer from London with Qatar Airways in economy class, and was impressed with the standards of service then. Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Edinburgh to Hong Kong via Doha,July 2015,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Instead of going home I will be waiting in Fort Lauderdale airport for 4 hours, where I just watched a half full flight board and take off for the same location (because I wonâ€™t pay $75!).

The first leg from New York (LGA) to Houston (IAH) was an incredible 1st class flight with outstanding service. However, my connection from IAH to Lubbock, TX (LBB) was miserable. One would think that a tiny plane at 60% capacity with NO first class section would allow some flexibility, but apparently thatâ€™s not the case with UA. I ended up next to another 6â€™5 male in an already ultra-tight seating arrange (reason #1 I donâ€™t fly United). I quickly felt like the ultimate â€œcommonerâ€ no longer in 1st class when asking to change seats to one of the 3 bulkhead seats with no passenger after the main doors were closed. â€œSorry sir, only Gold and Platinum flyers are allowedâ€ is not a comforting feeling after I just spent $1165 on a last minute first class ticket!! If thatâ€™s a company policy change it! Thatâ€™s classless United Airlines. I didnâ€™t request a first class seat. I requested a poor bulkhead with the tightest legroom of any carrier Iâ€™ve flown.

Needless to say if the equipment was in working order I never would have moved in the first place. In order to avoid the situation escalating I did move again to the back of the plane.

I asked her if there was going to be an announcement. She said we will announce it at the door but not over the loud speaker. How can you say that to people that are deplaning? It's their duty to announce the closing of the gate so everyone that left can hear. Long story short, there was a 6 hour delay and we had to board a new plane.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,Len Kaminski,17th September 2015,"I commend Southwest Airlines on the exceptional customer service I experienced today. Southwest Airlines actually contacted me by phone regarding an upcoming trip in January from San Juan to Canton /Akron. The flight was moved from the early afternoon to 6:45 am. That would present little issue except that we are arriving in to San Juan on a cruise ship at 8:00 am. and could not make the flight. The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport. I called Customer Service and they could not have made it easier for me and were more than willing to accommodate our request.

American Airlines,2.0,M Dalton,22nd January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | We had four itineraries on AA during our recent holiday to the US and Mexico with the final and worst being from Cancun to Miami. Some slight improvements since they ""lost"" our luggage years ago (and almost had to be sued for compensation) but still a 2 star airline. Boarding usually a shambles exacerbated by people flying with pets (dog fights at gates comical). Also people travelling with too much carry on causing huge delays. It isn't such an issue in other countries I'm not sure why such a problem with US airlines after having so many years to address the problem,. The real entertainment is usually the cabin crew, who I am sure are mostly nice people, it is just that their standard of training and presentation takes the joy out of the entire experience. Whilst all flights were pleasant enough, just walking onto a plane to see two poorly dressed flight attendants standing with their backs to you eating, instead of greeting customers is so bad it's hilarious. And it was the same for each of the seven legs we took over these three tickets. Apart from that the flights offered a variety of mediocre experiences from airplane condition to not being offered headphones in first class, but that didn't bother us as much as the dreadful presentation and complete lack of pride and professionalism. We only fly AA for the status credits to keep our Qantas Platinum (Oneworld Emerald), I hope that AA's recent image overhaul is still underway and better training standards on the horizon. Note - there isn't a Oneworld lounge at CUN and AA will not check your bags beyond USA, even though we were connecting to another Oneworld airline in biz class - Qatar (talk about chalk and cheese).

American Airlines,1.0,Y Zhang,18th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I am baffled at how unprofessional the entire American Airlines staff was at LAX. I was dropping off my parents at LAX We arrived at the airport around 10:30. We went in and used the check-in kiosk (but the kiosk said our confirmation number was incorrect) We decided to wait in line. Once we noticed that the kiosk assistance was free, my father asked for help but was surprised to receive a rude response from the staff member who rolled their eyes and proceeded to walk away. At that time we decided to continue to wait in line to speak with the check-in staff. My father even helped a single mother who was next in line who was clearly having difficulties with putting her luggage on the scale. We noticed that no one from the staff was helping her and seeing that she an infant strapped to the front he decided to step in. At this this point it was 10:50pm and we were getting anxious about missing our flight and going through security. So I took the initiative to walk up patiently to the desk. and was told final boarding was completed and that no other passengers were able to board. However after calling corporate head quarters, once we got home, we learn that final boarding time was actually 15 min prior to the flight time. The desk person told me to rush to ticketing to see if there was a connecting flight to get to our airport in Orlando. When we got to ticketing, we noticed that there were barely anyone in line, but the staff had no urgency or professionalism toward the waiting passengers/customers that needed help. There were only two customers in front of me. This is ridiculous in terms of manpower to customers, as there were 6 American Airlines staff members. I waited 15 minutes in line patiently. During this time, I saw an AA staff member who was easily identifiable. She just finished up with a customer. I waited a few minutes to wait for her to flag the next customer. She didnâ€™t flag the next person (me), but instead was talking casually to the other staff members. So I walked up and waited to be addressed since she was talking. I did not say a single word or interrupt. She looked up at me and said in the most rude condescending disrespectful tone, that they werenâ€™t ready. So I said back, â€œexcuse me I didnâ€™t even say anything to youâ€. Four other staff members who were free proceeded to talk and chat amongst each other. At this time, there were 7 parties behind us who needed assistance. I was finally helped around 11:10.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to MCO,April 2016,,,,,1.0,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,2.0,Matt James,2nd August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Originally supposed to fly Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam. I arrived at terminal A at the airport in Boston at 13.00 for the 16.45 flight. Check-in took longer than it should. I then went to the Delta skyclub lounge and it was dirty. The food was mediocre. You also have to ask an employee for the wifi password. I went to the gate and the flight started boarding at the normal time. Seats were not the most comfortable, even for business class. A crew member rudely forced me to put my passport in the overhead bin rather than in front of me. I never forget stuff on aircrafts! We were just about to depart when the captain told us there was a delay because of a broken air vent in the cockpit that was just discovered. The plane was sitting at that gate all day. Why didnâ€™t they spot the damage when the plane arrived from Amsterdam that morning? First the crew spent 25 minutes trying to fix the vent in the hot sun with no air conditioning allowed, then another 30 minutes talking on the phone with their maintenance HQ, then they told us there would be a delay until 20.30 at night. We were forced to exit the aircraft so they could take it to the hangar. Now we had 300 people with missed connections waiting in line at the help desk with only 2 employees there. The staff acted uncaring and oblivious and many people were getting very angry with them. When I reached the front of the line the Delta customer service staff told me I couldnâ€™t do anything and I was forced to stay on this delayed flight. They didnâ€™t even look at other options! I did not see them look down at their computer screens when I asked them about re-booking. They probably just want my money. They never updated us on the repair progress but the flight was now delayed until 23.00. At that point I wouldnâ€™t make it back to Austria for another 2 days. I called my travel agent and they successfully rebooked me on a 22.15 Lufthansa flight through Frankfurt. It was on time and everything about that airline (lounge and aircraft) was so much better than Delta! I arrived in Vienna 5 hours later than expected.

American Airlines,1.0,Eric Greek,17th March 2014,3 flights with 3 problems in less than a month. First bad weather cancels flight which can hardly be blamed on the airline. Not being able to even reach an agent to rebook for 48 hours and being forced to use an alternate airline to make meeting. Most definitely can. Second sat on tarmac for an hour waiting quite literally for a piece of paper certifying weight and then being forced to return to gate and refuel when minimum safe fuel line is broken was not fun. Having to literally run to connecting flight is even less fun. Especially when a comfortable wait was programmed into original flight. Third went to check in for overseas flight booked by government and after standing in line (no military bypass in system for check in) was unapologetically and without assistance punted to partner airline to stand in line for another hour. Because people who ticket with AA are just supposed to know this - particularly when standard check in procedures block military travel and leaves you stranded.

For this reason we decided to book on Qatar. As the time got closer I mailed to ask about this, the staff replies were short, rude and unhelpful.

American Airlines,2.0,W Burg,8th July 2014,Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight.

Turkish Airlines,5.0,Randal Frivold,11th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service.

I usually fly Business and or First class but on this occasion I had decided to travel to Thailand at extremely short notice (roughly 3 hours), so therefore my business partner accidentally booked tickets in economy. Which is not usually my preference when taking a flight. Yet I could not find fault with the level of service I received on each flight and in particular the flight QR9 from Doha to London, was simply exceptional. I cannot thank the cabin crew of Qatar Airways enough for making what could have easily been a set of nightmare journeys for myself. In the end, amazing. If you are considering booking with Qatar Airways and find yourself somewhat hesitant due to having read some of the bad reviews, I would ask you to consider the fact that when It comes to reviews of anything you can be almost certain that they tend to be completely polarised viewpoints. And as such you should treat them with a pinch of salt. Go with an open mind, you'll probably find your flight just fine.

We were flying on vacation from Seattle to Cancun - 1 stop in Charolette, North Carolina. I chose this flight because it was a red eye flight beginning at 10:30 PM to allow us almost a full extra day of vacation in Cancun. The A321 airplane they used on our first flight was horrible. No in-flight entertainment system, no charging area in your seats and the seat space was cramped. On our second flight on our way to Cancun we were on the tarmac when the pilot notified us of an issue with the plane where we would have to return to the gate for a 20 mins fix. Once at the gate, we were told the paperwork would delay us longer and they would find another aircraft. After another 2 hour wait the flight was just cancelled. No notification at all. 280 people began scrambling to find another flight. Needless to say they sent us to customer service where they had major computer issues and just rebooked us all on another flight the next day. This was after 2 hours of standing in line. They put us up in a hotel by the airport, with no bags, and a $12.00 per person food voucher only for use at the airport with no restaurants but a small Starbucks for food. They made a meager attempt to give us 15,000 miles for our inconvenience but that doesn't cover our lost day of vacation, hotel fees for a day in Cancun, and additional food and Uber expenses in Charlotte.

Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route.

On other legs, staff glanced at the exact same bag and instantly ok'd it for carry on. En route an urgent issue arose and it was physically impossible for me to access counter staff so I had to phone the call centre. I explained the problem at least 4 or 5 times clearly and in detail but the agent would not listen or answer my questions. She just referred me to counter staff. On line check in is terrible - virtually impossible to use and judging by the long periods of time it is unavailable, Aeromexico does not give it priority. Seat comfort was average. Movie selection was excellent, music selection was abysmal. You need to pay extra attention to their scheduling. They have some short delays but once, for an international connecting flight I had, they suddenly, with less than 24 hours notice, scheduled departure for one hour earlier. Often Aeromexico offers the best fares, but they also have the earmarks of an airline that is increasingly trying to cut corners to the detriment of customers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Lima,November 2017,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,yes
Southwest Airlines,1.0,Stephanie Dauzat,17th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Los Angeles to New Orleans. My originally flight from Oakland to LAX with connection flight LAX to MSY was postponed due to mechanical windshield wiper motor error. Our flight was changed 3 times with the best option staying with original flight and hoping plane would be fixed. After 4 hours we finally flew to LAX where we had to wait in baggage claim for 3 hours and argue to get a hotel (reminder that we missed our connection flight home due to southwest equipment malfunction). Southwest gave us a voucher for travel to and from hotel but second voucher could not be plugged into app as payment. Staffs response was â€œI donâ€™t know how to help you.â€ Staff was unhelpful and inefficient having to contact supervisor for hotel then travel arrangements to and from hotel. We had NO direct contact or conversation with the manager. Once we arrived to the hotel which was 30 minutes away from the airport, the service desk attendant told us they never received a call from southwest and hopefully she could find us a room. We decided to Uber back to LAX and payed on our expense due to voucher not working. Get to southwest for 7am flight after 3 hours of sleep due to inefficiency of staff and wasting our time trying to figure out processes which should already be in place. Flight from LAX to MSY was delayed yet again 2 hours due to mechanical errors. I asked the desk attendant if I could have more specifics to document for work and the response I received was â€œI donâ€™t know anything furtherâ€ and when I asked if there will be an announcement as to why flight was delayed the response I got was â€œno we are inspecting the plane and when it is safe to fly then we will notify youâ€.

I found very interesting the possibility of chatting from your seat with somebody else on the same plane through the IFE itself. A full hot meal was served (good quality) along with two rounds of hot drinks and spirits. Cabin crew was nice and polite but I really do not like their uniforms.

Lufthansa,8.0,Stefan Oelze,17th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,4.0,5.0,2.0,,2.0,3.0,yes

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,3.0,S Bakker,10th May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | My first flight in the itinerary AMS-SVO was delayed by 1 h due a malfunctioning aircraft (as I was told), so I missed in SVO my connection to ULN and was re-routed via PEK with Aeroflot SVO-PEC and Air China PEK-ULN. The flight SVO-PEK was 1 h late in PEK as well, and I was put in Beijing in a hotel for 24 h to wait for the next Air China flight. My visit to ULN was planned as 2 days long, so I requested an Aeroflot agent to send me back to AMS, as my trip had lost its purpose. The Aeroflot Agent in Beijing spoke very poor English, and he ignored my request without a reason provided, but recommended to call to Moscow during office hours in Moscow (it was 3 am in Moscow at the time of this conversation) and discuss this with people from central office. As long as it would be too late then, and because in my experience Aeroflot client support is useless and helpless, I went to the hotel (the hotel was very poor and in a very strange location, btw). Re. inflight experience. All the Aeroflot long haul cabins I was in (A330 for AMS-SVO and B777 for SVO-PEK) were tired, did not look very clean and chairs were not the best. In contrast, both B737 for ULN-SVO and A321 for SVO-AMS were brand new and clean. Meals were very decent on AMS-SVO-AMS, decent on ULN-SVO and very unimpressive on SVO-PEK, especially a weird plastic-packed cooky before the landing that was (I suspect) designed as a breakfast. In-flight entertainment systems were broken or not very responsive both in A330 and B777.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,9.0,J Park,10th March 2014,My wife and I flew from PEK-LHR with a tight 50 minute connection at SVO. Having to connect at SVO was the only downside to an otherwise comfortable and pleasant trip. Anyone who knows SVO terminal knows that it is overburdened chaotic and in dire need of an overhaul. We made our connecting flight (no thanks to the indifferent Aeroflot ground personnel) only because the aircraft was late arriving in Moscow. That said we still had to run through the terminal. Flights on SU were surprisingly good with comfortable seating choice of well catered meals and cabin attendants who were very professional and friendly. This airline has really upped their game on long haul international flights. In fact I dare say there are equal to if not better than many of their European competitors.

The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said â€œSick bags in the restroomâ€ no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service.

On the flight to HKG must say that the new business class seats are very narrow and not particularly comfortable to sleep in. There's also no privacy screen between seats. Meals were acceptable although on both occasions my first choice was not available which I found strange being in the middle of a half-empty cabin.

Virgin America,3.0,S Archer,15th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Francisco to Dallas. Yesterday when I was checking in for my flight today, I decided to spring for the upgrade to the exit row. I was re-assigned seat 9D. I printed my boarding pass at home. At the gate, the agent took my boarding pass from me and handed me a different one. I didn't notice till I got on the plane that my seat had been switched to a non-exit row 7A. When I brought the discrepancy up to the flight attendant she said I had to go back to the gate agent to rectify the problem. It took a few minutes to swim upstream to get there and by that time the gate agent was coming down the gangway and he refused to help me and told me to take it up with customer service. When I went to the seat on my boarding pass 7A, there was a child sitting in the seat next to his mother who was in the middle seat. When I sat down in the aisle seat, the other passenger asked me to move to another row since there were other seats available. There were two open seats in Row 9 so I went to sit in one of those and the gate agent and flight attendant insisted I could not sit there even though I had paid for the exit row. The gate agent was incredibly nasty and threatened me that if I didn't go sit in the back of the plane he would throw me off the flight. At no time did they ask the woman who put her kid in my seat to either move or let me sit in the aisle seat. As I had an important meeting in Dallas, I did find an open seat in the back of the plane.

The ticket price was actually quite low compared to other offers for these dates considering the flexibility in the choice of flights and the level of seat comfort is pretty good but the main thing is that Aeroflot should be training the staff harder if they want to improve their international profile.

When we got to the Agent, they said they were oversold and had to make many calls just to get us our boarding passes. We lost the seat assignments that we had made a month before. Evidently this happens often (that's what they said) and according to some other people we talked to, they sometimes deny boarding to people even in business class because they don't have the seats.

The flight attendants go running around and seem to be busy, but they really don't do much and hardly ever smile. From the start they gave my partner a glass of water rather than the wine he ordered. He hit his call button and they did not respond. They gave me the wrong main course. My partner order a coffee later with the second meal and they never brought it to him. There was a 2-3 year old girl running up and down the aisle for most of the flight, so it was impossible to take a nap. The flight attendants did nothing to stop it even though it interfered with their ability to provide service. Food was just okay. The bread was hard as a rock. Flight attendants did the first lunch meal service and then never checked back with us until last meal service on an 8-9 hour flight. Last meal before landing was a couple pieces of bread, cheese and meat. The seats were pretty good and go flat, but service and overall experience (especially check in) was very disappointing.",A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,FCO to JFK,July 2016,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,1.0,D Mashim,11th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Dubai to San Francisco. I do not think this airline cares about its economy class passengers. This is a very long flight. Two hours into flight, they did not even provided a cup of water. They gave a food menu. That was a farce. Was it due to the flight attendants negligence or airlines policy. Food menu had two choices, yet when time came they told us only one item is available, like it or not. The item were half cooked. They should have told us that no food will be available.

United Airlines,3.0,Divyanshu Soni,11th March 2014,I had the worst experience with this airline. I frequently fly between Hartford and Columbus. All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself. My morning flight the next day had a delay that cost be a full business day at work.

Qatar Airways,10.0,Rob Bowden,28th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business Class. I flew Birmingham to Bangkok via Doha on the 787 Dreamliner first leg then A380 second leg. The 787 business cabin in excellent with plenty of space. The seats are 1-2-1 lie flat pod style all with aisle access. The service is always excellent, the staff are so well trained and always friendly, unlike Emirates. I had an amazing 4 course meal on the first leg, soup, fish, cheese cake and cheese board with 30 year tawny port. I watched 3 new movies on the 7 hour flight before arrival in Doha. I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar. I've had many good times in this bar but I didn't use it this time. I agree with other reviewers that Qatar offers the best business class, mainly due to the excellent staff. Emirates should send a mystery shopper to see how it should be done.","787, A380",Couple Leisure,Business Class,Birmingham to Bangkok via Doha,June 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,9.0,F Torres,21st June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | The flight from Hong Kong to Moscow was delayed though not the fault of the airline as the cause was due to traffic at the runway. Plane from Hong Kong to Moscow was a B777-300ER which has good IFE, seat pitch in the economy class is similar to most airlines of the same aircraft. It was relatively clean and flight attendants are ready to assist passengers. Plane from Moscow to Tel Aviv was A330 2x4x2 seat configuration in the economy class. I would say that it has more legroom than the B777. Take off and landing were both smooth. My observation on all Aeroflot flights, drinks are served first then the meal followed after half an hour and another round of drinks after another half an hour. It was a bit inconvenient eating without something to drink. The food trays are collected by the flight attendants after 30 minutes or so that passngers voluntered to bring them to the galley. .Definitely no alcholo on-board. For the price, which was the cheapest of all arilines flying Hong Kong to Tel Aviv (got mine for only $615), I would definitely fly with Aeroflot and recommend it to my freinds.","Boeing 777-300ER, A330",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Tel Avia via Moscow,June 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Air Canada,1.0,Maryam Sabour,3rd August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to San Francisco. Air Canada has a problem in their system where they can't get the spelling of my name right. Every time I make a booking the system deletes the last letter of my name ""Maryam"" becomes ""Marya"". Because of this, I can never check-in online at their system and with any booking I have to see an in person agent every time. As a frequent flyer for business, I am a NEXUS holder, never check baggage and always check-in online to avoid long waiting lines. However because of this problem I will forever have to get to airport early, and stand in line to have an agent correct my name on my boarding pass otherwise security will not let me through with the error on my boarding pass. Last week I flew to SFO from YYZ and Air Canada refused to let me bypass an-hour long line to have the change made and get on to my flight. They told me security would not have a problem letting me through but of course what happened? Security would not let me through and made me go back and stand in line for the Air Canada agent to change my name on the boarding pass. This is insane for an airline like Air Canada to not solve a problem that affects every person whose first name ends in the letter ""M"". They told me the system thinks that ""M"" stands for Mr. or Ms. so it gets mixed up. When I reached out to the Customer Relations team, after providing me with a 25% one time discount, told me they would not help me further, update me on whether this issue would ever be solved, or speak to me regarding this issue again.",,Business,Business Class,Toronto to San Francisco,July 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

No amenity bag given on day flight. Which is a shocker. Flight was full as such the bar area was packed. Arrived at DXB connecting flight in concourse B. Business lounge seem like a free for all where they allowed anyone in. Over crowded and not enough seating. Showers busy, dark and outdated. Flight to KL seats better. Night flight food was breakfast. Had the omelette which wasnâ€™t overly nice. Arrived on time. Had to get train to the baggage hall. 1st one to arrive. My flight companion bag came off 1st. However due to error by BHX not labelling my bag correctly with business tag it came off around an hour later with the economy passengers. As such missed my connection. Anyway return journey in business lounge in KL very small. Showers were a bit worn out and not clean. Food was barely warm and limited. Night flight and managed to get a few hours sleep.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Ben Kalish,18th March 2016,"Delta continues to deliver sub-par service. I fly under government negotiated fares for domestic travel on a regular basis. The ticket booked was for San Diego to SLC on a Delta flight, and from SLC back to San Diego via SEATAC on a delta booked ticket on Alaska Airlines. On the way out, the flight was delayed on departure. No reason was given. On the way back, I ended up finishing early. I called Alaska to try to shift to an earlier flight. As expected, Alaska picked up in a couple of minutes. I attempted to utilize the Alaska Airlines same day ticketed change program to move to an earlier, direct flight back to San Diego, but the relationship with Delta made it so their system wouldn't process the change without cancelling my ticket and rebooking. They told me to call Delta. I called Delta, but was immediately put into the que. Rather than wait I opted to take the call back. It took them more than 30 minutes to call me back. Fail on customer service. When they did call me back, they first tried to charge me a $200 change fee on a government fare. This isn't allowed under their negotiated contract, but I had to argue with them to get them to realize this. If I hadn't known this, they would have tried to shove that down my throat. Then they told me that even without the fee, it was going to cost $200 + to change my ticket due to a difference in fare. Their excuse was that I didn't have a reservation when I had just given them a ticket number. At this point, the conversation ended due to a clear issue with them being able to do their job and me being unwilling to pay for something that would have been free had I booked my entire trip with Alaska airlines in the first place.

Emirates,6.0,India Stoughton,5th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Beirut to Colombo via Dubai. The flights were comfortable both ways and Emirates staff on board were helpful and friendly but on our way back from Colombo to Dubai we had a short layover and our first flight was delayed and then parked miles from the terminal, necessitating a long bus ride and meaning that we rushed to make our connection. When we arrived at our gate we enquired if our bags would make the connection and were told that they were in the process of being transferred. Our flights was then delayed by the gate for 30 minutes, leaving plenty of time for the bags to be loaded. Despite this, when we arrived in Beirut, we received a message to say our luggage wasn't on the plane and would arrive on the next flight, eight hours later. We were told by ground staff that it could not be delivered and we would have to return to the airport to collect it. It took us almost an hour to find the Emirates office and someone who would help us. He promised that if we returned that evening to collect the bags the office would be open and Emirates staff would help us and would reimburse our taxi costs. When we got back, the office was closed and locked and no one answered the phone. We tried going back three times over the course of an hour. No one was there. Eventually we got our bags but the process meant we lost almost four hours of our day and over $30 in additional taxi costs.

When we explained that we had already left the airport, they told us to come back, despite the fact that we had already lost all the money on the extra taxis, not to mention our one free day back at home to prepare before going back to work.

The female flight attendant sat strapped in and facing us mid-flight and ate, after which we were given nothing. We arrived at 5:55am without being offered juice or coffee prior to landing. We were to be given ""snacks"" plural but got only one snack serving at the start of the flight and nothing during the rest of the time. We had no brewed coffee available. The flight attendants' uniforms looked as though they had slept in when we boarded the plane. This was the most class-less First Class. The air quality was also poor. There was a strange smell when we got on, and it did not dissipate. You could choose to close air vents or endure cold air blasting down on your head. The equipment should be replaced and so should the crew. The seats are hard and barely recline. We were on time and had a safe flight.

One of these bumps ended up forcing my girlfriend and I to stay in Mexico City (not my final destination) and robbing us of one day of a long awaited weeklong vacation. Honestly the people that work for the company don't care and you will feel it at every check in counter. With all of the interactions and issues I faced with Aeromexico I feel like I have enough data to say that 50-75% of the time they will screw up your reservation in one way or another.

Lufthansa has added a stop in Kuwait on the way to FRA presumably to fill seats since it has competition on this route from Qatar Airways A350. The A330-300 from Doha was very comfortable and food much better than the longer flight to LAX. This is an extra journey with layover and takes over 25 hours. The bathrooms in the A380 behind row 15 are small and spartan for business class. At six per row, the seats are not that wide and you get reasonably intimate with total strangers. In spite of all the fuss about new menu based on flyer preferences, the offerings were nothing to crow about. Portions tend to me on the cuisine minceur size. Snacks came about midflight and consisted of small servings. When I asked if could have two, ""just choose one now, we may not have enough,"" was the reply. Two minutes later an extra snack was handed. There was no announcement about a bar on the upper deck or snacks/fruits available in the galley. WIFI was available but not free in business class. It was easy to use and reasonably fast. In spite of the little glitches, Lufthansa has the best FA's in the industry.

A text from them told me they cancelled our flights due to 'Operational Requirements' 6 weeks before our holiday and to ring them. They offered night flights several days later or to travel 5.5 hours to fly from Heathrow. Work, Pre-booked Trains. hotels and ferries meant we had to travel on that day from Manchester as Heathrow was Â£300 more for us to get there at short notice. At no point were they going to meet extra travel costs or compensate the 4 of us in any way other than refund our flights which we have had to do. Why they didn't provide a coach to transport people from Manchester - Heathrow I don't know and the unsympathetic attitude to our prearranged details astounded us. The result is we are flying with an alternative airline at a cost of Â£500 more per couple. Customer Services are next to useless and online only as there's nobody you can talk to in person. I'm still awaiting my refund which they say will take 10-15 working days. Today it's come to our attention that they're operating a flight out of Manchester on the morning our flight was due to depart via Brussels which would get us to Athens at a similar time to what we should have arrived. Upon bringing this to their attention and asking why we weren't offered this option they say they use Aegean Flights only in these situations. The first leg was operated by Brussels Airlines and the second part being Aegean themselves. They sell the flights, there was room on the flights yet we were not offered the option of them even though it would've been the easy alternative. It's the last time we'll fly with them.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,3.0,C Cassius,23rd December 2013,RIO-AMS-BUD. The first leg of the trip was AMS-FCO with KLM and on to GRU with Alitalia. As a Dutch national living between AMS and BUD I had a separate ticket BUD-AMS that same morning connecting in AMS for above mentioned schedule which was booked through Expedia on a separate ticket. 10 days before departure tried to select a seat and modify the travel class for the leg RIO-AMS to Economy Comfort but could not access my booking. Check- in at BUD airport not overly friendly. Even though I had received an email from KLM alerting me that online check- in had commenced hey could not see any other booking and tagged my luggage only to AMS. Re-checked luggage in AMS but they also could not understand or solve issue. Online check-in Rio to AMS opens some 30 hours prior to departure. Tried to check-in and change seat selection and travel class online to no avail. System would only indicate that seat selection is not possible and check-in should be at airport. Eventually changed that during check-in at GIG which was friendly and hassle-free. Flight itself (GIG-AMS leg) was delayed by more than one hour but arrival was only 30 min behind schedule. Seat (first row of economy comfort) is comfortable enough and recline allows for relatively good sleep. Crew friendly attentive and professional. Plane clean. Food and entertainment sub-par. Would have given a 7 for the experience but for the glitch in the entire booking management process and the abysmal customer service feedback.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,no

The customer service reps said the most they could do was see if they could get some blankets for everyone, no refunds, no bus to get us home, no vouchers, nothing, most people ended up renting cars and driving to the destination.

People in line checked weather apps for Burbank, SFO and Monterey, it was clear and beautiful in all those places and everywhere in between. They use weather as the excuse so they don't have to refund the tickets because it's beyond their control.

Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?)

Air New Zealand,1.0,H Salzberg,19th January 2015,"SYD-AKL. I was booked in business class on a late afternoon flight. I was informed by the airline that there had been a change and the flight no longer offered business class. Instead I was offered something called World Deluxe Service which is ridiculous and expensive for what it is. Basically it is a fully economy A320 aircraft where the first two rows only use two of the three seats. Essentially someone sits in 1A and 1C but they don't sell 1B. You also get lounge access and the onboard economy meal. I actually had to argue with the booking agent that I was entitled to money back. I had to explain that I had purchased a business class ticket (for myself wife and son) and now that they no longer provided me with business class they actually owed me money. Eventually they relented. The aircraft was absolutely disgusting. It was ancient (or looked ancient). My family was in 1A 1C and 1D (no one was in 1F or in row two at all). There was no divider wall in front of row one so I had to privilege of basically sitting in the galley for three hours watching the flight attendants work. My son was seated in 1C but I had to move him because ""he was too young for an exit row"". Since when is row one an exit row? We were sitting opposite two flight attendants. Wouldn't they operate the door in an emergency? Where they expecting my 9 year old to do it? Air New Zealand's seat selection system is the worst. It is time for the IT department to let you pick specific seats for each passenger instead of picking a block of seats for you. The seats on this aircraft had perhaps a millimetre of recline. It was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have never been on. The entertainment system worked poorly and my son's did not work at all. The only positive is that the Air New Zealand staff are perhaps the nicest people anywhere.

Air Canada,6.0,D Epstein,24th February 2015,ORD-YUL-CDG in economy on 25/26th Jan 15. Our first flight with Air Canada was a shuttle from Chicago to Montreal where our flight to Paris CDG was our next leg. In fact due to late arrival we missed our connection and had to stay 24 hours in Montreal. Everything was handled perfectly by AC staff who gave us vouchers for a 4* hotel nearby and for meals. We could get our checked luggage back and were immediately handed our boarding pass for the following day. All being very smooth in a quiet airport. The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America. It is true that US competitors are so bad but European airlines are much better and Emirates/Asian carriers are on another planet where passengers are taken care of.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,no

United Airlines,3.0,Bojan Tercon,29th September 2015,"Every time I have to fly United Airlines I dread it. At least they were consistent. I just donâ€™t understand why they donâ€™t get it. Boeing 767-400 is old and looks old. They serve welcome champagne in plastic cups. The 2-1-2 seats are cramped, especially when youâ€™re trying to sleep. I intentionally took the centre single seat, although I always sit by the window, for I didnâ€™t want to be stepping over unknown people when heading for the bathroom. The colors of the interior are drab and dull - gray and mute blue. Could they not at least add some colorful dinnerware or napkins or blankets or pillow. Spice up the cabin. I will say that the meal options have improved. The dinner menu was rather good. Midway through the flight I had asked a FA when will United get rid of their 767â€™s for they are old planes. The one we were flying on was 15 years old. I hope that United will bring back the joy and luxury of flying some day. It would really make me smile and not dread flying them.",Boeing 767-400,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Zurich,September 2015,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,no

Air New Zealand,1.0,Alex Kilroy,9th December 2013,My 18 year old son has just arrived in Vancouver after flying MEK-AKL-YVR. He is travelling to a skiing camp so had excess and over sized baggage which we had accounted for. Check-in at the at the airport is an e-kiosk with no option to use a counter. This is fine if flying is straight forward and you have one bag. I was most unimpressed and sought assistance from ground staff who were helpful. I noticed older passengers who were struggling and thought about families with young children bags prams and car seats and wonder how one person is to manage. The plane was old and the seat uncomfortable and he was served the identical meal on the Auckland and Vancouver legs. Luckily it was good however being hungry he asked for a second meal and was told he couldn't have one - this is company policy. So he went hungry for a 12 hr flight. This is not acceptable and we will not be flying Air NZ again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Our originally scheduled flight that was leaving at 12:30 became 1:30 then 2:10 then 3:10 then 3:44 and so on and so forth until we arrived at the 6:30 pm time. Instead of being honest about the delay from the very beginning, jetblue continued to send those emails leaving me at the airport for over 7-8 hours and my puppy at home alone without any secondary options. When I called for Help, it was not the service level you couldâ€™ve expected. I hung up the phone unsatisfied and even more disappointed than before. With every employee giving me a different answer such as â€œJFK has shut down all incoming and outgoing flightsâ€ - not true as there was another Jetblue flight that came in to â€œthe flight is in the air and will arrive soonâ€- also not true as the flight hasnâ€™t even left off yet.

The B777-300 ER is a nice plane with departure at 12.20 am. With all the time spent in the airport and the lousy lounges at Manila airport (not airline's fault) one gets to the flight starving. Just to find out they have ""Light Bites Service"". All options below business class standards. Tiny portion leaves you starving for the rest of the flight until breakfast comes. No service in between. This service takes more than two hours to be completed when people want to go to sleep as soon as possible. Then the connection to Amman was far worse. A330 plane is really bad when the passenger in front of you fully reclines you end up with his head on your lap. When things couldn't get worse they did on the way back. Ground staff at Cairo are as bad as the airport itself. No priority boarding long faces a true mess. Fortunately I was served dinner as it was dinner time. B777-200 also a very bad aircraft. My ICE screen got stuck when the guy in front of me reclined fully. Crew did nothing. Then another red-eye to Manila more ""Light Bites"" service crew took three hours in offering the duvet for the hard seats (by then they already woke me up).

United Airlines,1.0,R Hall,31st October 2014,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward.

When it did the FA (another one) poured too much and spilt some on me but she was in a rush to push her trolley to even say a word of apology.

Qatar Airways,7.0,R John,10th October 2013,MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

The ground staff are not attentive. Let you wait without saying a word of acknowledgement. They have self service bag drop which cannot work sometimes and the assistance is also poor. There is no flexibility from the staff in regards to following baggage policy. I have experienced this problem and heard from three people with the same issues. Cleanliness - very old and dirty aircraft. Dirts and candies were on the floor under my seat, the grease stain was still on the inflight entertainment screen which I had to use my napkin to wipe off. The seat is very tight and not comfortable. Inflight entertainment compared to Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines etc is much less. I guess they didn't really improve headphones quality as I had to ask to change headphones 3 times until I can find a pair that works. Food of a very low quality. I tried 'vietnamese cuisine' but it was really not vietnamese as the food was greasy and full of weird spices. This was my first time using Air New Zealand on an international flight and this has been a complete let down and my expectations of a high quality airline that they heavily invested in their PR to build the image has been destroyed.

The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.,,,Premium Economy,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,yes

Lufthansa,9.0,V Sung,4th March 2016,"Overall enjoyable flights with Lufthansa. The food was much better than expected - on the leg from Munich to Shanghai, the menu featured a dish from the chef at the Pudong Shangri-La, one of Shanghai's top hotels. I also enjoyed the snack sandwiches and chocolates. Service from the flight attendants was very professional and standard. In-flight entertainment was sufficiently current. Nice new airplane with a separate lower floor for the bathrooms, limiting line ups and waiting passengers in the aisles. My only complaint was the seating: The legroom was quite cramped - my knees touched the seat in front of me if I reclined, and I am only 165cm. The padding on the seating was also a bit thin, and I could feel the seam stitching on the seat through my clothing.

My partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. When the food does arrive it's sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce. Yes, the aircraft are new and the IFE ok but the attitude of the cabin crew doesn't match. They appear surly and unsmiling as if us paying passengers are an inconvenience.

This is a ""best of times/worst of times"" review about that experience with United Airlines from New Delhi, India to Newark. The bad side was that the United desk in New Delhi was very late in informing us of the cancellation. I, and many others, had cleared immigration/security before United told us. My wife, who was in the US, told me later she knew the flight was cancelled long before I did by watching the United website. This late notice left us stuck in the secure area. We had a long (2+ hours) wait before the staff was able to get us out of that area. The good side was the once United got organized they were very supportive in providing us free room and board in a 5 star hotel for as long as we needed.

My wife and I objected explaining that since we had to make a connecting flight, there would not be time to wait for our bags to be unloaded.

As one of the newer aircraft to United Airlines fleet I had expected a lot better than this. Seats are well below comfort standards of most Asian airlines, and whilst I had experienced some reasonable serviced in a couple of United domestic flights, the flight attendants on this route were simply abysmal. When they were visible in the cabin they seemed to spend their time smirking and chatting to each other and customers were second priority. It was like watching children misbehave and just embarrassing. On the one hand their profits shoot up, but what customers get is terrible. I don't understand why US travellers stay loyal to such a faded, out of date and poor airline, but guess it's all about flyer points.

Itâ€™s all good on Southwest if you flight actually leaves, but once your flight is cancelled, good luck trying to get another flight with the next 5 days.

I used the economy check in and after 20 minutes in the queue I was told by the airport staff that unfortunately Aegean pay to have their business class check in open for less time than all other airlines in T2 and so it would open later. Shocking! Aegean, if you can't afford to have business class check in open, do not sell business class tickets or do not fly to Heathrow. Also, when arrived in Athens, once again the A321 full with over 200 passengers and in the middle of a storm, parked at a remote stand rather than at an air bridge. This seems to be common practice for Aegean and the excuse that all air bridges are occupied is simply not true because on this occasion nearly all of them were free. Aegean are clearly cutting corners but their fares are still very high. Their level of service though has dropped significantly to the point that it will cost them passengers.

Since I was supposed to be making an international flight, they quickly rebooked me to fly to Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Hamburg. The flight from Chattanooga to Chicago was decent. I had a 4 hour layover in Chicago waiting to board my international flight to Frankfurt. As I was boarding the employees pulled me aside and told me my boarding pass wasnâ€™t valid. They said I was booked going to Stockholm in the computer system. So they didnâ€™t let me board the plane until they could figure out whatâ€™s going on. Then the plane closed the door and took off without me because they couldnâ€™t sort out my ticket situation. So whoever rebooked my ticket, did something completely wrong - gave me a boarding pass that wasnâ€™t actually valid, and I missed an overnight international flight.

Air New Zealand,7.0,J Pearson,26th August 2014,I am a Qantas Platinum but decided to try something different. Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing! Lack of storage in seat area. Would I fly Air NZ again? Only if the price was right.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Southwest Airlines,1.0,J Bova,11th February 2017,"â Unverified | Newark to Orlando. Open seating policy. I've never flown Southwest Airlines before today. In fact we're still taxiing as I write this. I was told the night before that there is an open seating policy with Southwest but until boarding I didn't quite understand what that meant. For those of you who do not know, when you check-in you are assigned a zone and a number. This is the order by which you board and from there it's general admission. Maybe that sounds fine until you travel with your wife and kid and realize that you will be forced to rely on the general good will of the 160 people who have boarded the plane ahead of you in order to sit with your family. We were not so fortunate. Even when the entire plane of passengers was bribed with free drinks for the flight, there were still no takers. I boarded the plane only to find 14 or so empty middle seats. This is my first and last flight on Southwest Airlines.

My experience with American Airlines as a whole is abysmal, however, there was an instance that occurred last night that is ridiculous. My husband and I were flying from Cancun to Charlotte and then Omaha. Our flight to Charlotte landed about ten minutes late, we then had to go through immigration, customs, and security again and make it to our next flight that was in one hour. We got through everything as quickly as we could and then ran to the gate our flight was leaving out of and had missed it by 3 minutes. The workers at that gate directed us to a service desk to help with rerouting our flight. We explained the situation to the service desk and they put us on standby on a flight in the morning and reported that they could not confirm this flight for us because missing the flight was our fault. We asked for a hotel voucher for the night and this was refused for the same reason - that missing our flight was our fault. They refused to do anything else. The plane was late, we had to wait in three lines to get to a gate on the opposite end of the terminal, and these three lines took their sweet ass time.

Air Canada,7.0,G Cassie,20th November 2014,"YVR to NRT. First off you can fly YVR to Haneda on ANA. I recommend that route. Narita is such a hassle even on the ""direct"" NEX train it takes an hour into Tokyo and that is after the long haul flight after Customs after waiting for a train before you transfer again in Tokyo or even if your hotel is near a station make the 900 meter walk out of Tokyo Central or Shinagawa. (I am not exaggerating. The time it takes to wheel your luggage from the NEX at Central to the lobby at the Shangri-La is nearly 20 minutes and that's when the station is relatively quiet.) AC was using an older aircraft on this route and it wasn't really too noticeable until we flew back on something much better (Cathay). The biz config in AC with their very comfortable if a tad firm lie flat seats afford privacy and ensure a good rest. The AV system is good although the screens aren't too big. Crew was extremely attentive and very friendly. One even had a sense of humour! The first meal was half decent quite good. The second a breakfast was mediocre. I find the ""second"" meal on AC long haul flights is always a letdown. The wine on AC could be better. On Cathay they were serving better champagne a wonderful Saint Veran a superb Gruner Vetliner and a lot of other wines that had obviously been tested at 39000 feet. Most AC wines just don't make the cut at the altitude. This was a points flight but if I was paying I would definitely choose ANA.",,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,yes

Twice now with well over an hour delay in a row for an airline I use to consider reliable. The worst part was the complete lack of information. The employees ran for whatever hidden cover they could to avoid questions. The captain came on just to give a 15min update of we aren't moving yet and they are working on it because in his words, ""he was required to by law"" as if the law wasn't there he wouldn't care. The lack of communication is dumbfounding for an airline who use to pride themselves on customer service and quality. The least they could do is give us a free movie for the delay but they didn't last flight that had a 2 hr delay and I have no faith this one will either if we ever get off the ground that is.

Southwest Airlines,4.0,Michael Hammel,30th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Diego to Sacramento. No interest in helping passengers. They create arbitrary timelines regarding departure time and announcements, with no real structure. Their ability to brush off all customer concerns and ""pass off"" customers to avoid problems overshadows the prices for flights. They are cheap for a reason. Consistently stuck on planes waiting for passengers on one flight, and on the next they turn multiple people away. They state they do hard paperwork for the pilot before each flight, which must be untrue if they pilot comes walking on 5 minutes before departure. Another example of an airline that overbooks passengers. When asked about the status of my luggage, I was informed of a new ""system"" to check luggage. The employee stated she could not see where my luggage went due to the new system. This is a joke Southwest.

The crew were indifferent cold and impersonal. There was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew (with the exception of the inflight supervisor) unwilling to engage in conversation. I mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the Captain had the seatbelt sign on. Dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. The plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour!! Too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. Food was good but not fantastic. The inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. The seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. Happy to note that Qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued.

American Airlines,1.0,Jackeline Voigt,28th May 2018,"âŒ Not Verified | I was very dissatisfied with American Airlines during my last trip. My flight from Colorado Springs to Shreveport was weather delayed in Colorado Springs. I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again. They would not even offer me restitution or a baggage refund for my inconvenience unless I showed receipts of $150.00 or more.",,Business,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Shreveport via Dallas,2018-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no
American Airlines,2.0,G Keene,2nd October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Portland via Charlotte. I rarely fly AA and will avoid doing so at all costs in the future. While the rate was decent, that was the only positive experience out of 4 flights. The trip was from the US to London via Dallas going, and Charlotte returning. AA was the operator for British Airways for the first 3 legs. For check-in, I attempted to do this via the mobile app and online. The message I got was that since they are operating the flight for BA, that I needed to do check in with BA, and gave me an option to redirect to their site. Fine. But once there, BA said I had to check in with AA. Anyone see the problem here? Not having the ability to check in electronically is incredibly stupid in the year 2018. Checking in at PDX was fine, as I was at least able to use the kiosk. Checking in for the return trip at Heathrow was not fine. The kiosk took me through the entire process and gave a message at the end stating I had to see a customer service representative. To say that these reps were slow would be an understatement. It took them 45 minutes to process the roughly 5 people / groups ahead of me. 45 minute delay at an already notoriously slow airport. Thanks, AA. On-board, I would characterize the attitudes of the flight attendants as varying between indifferent and rude. They don't seem to be trained that they are in the business of serving customers, not belittling them. I felt like a number, when other airlines seem to treat people with respect. Getting bags was a chore as well, as AA doesn't seem to care about connection times, and takes a really long time to get bags out onto the conveyor. Other airlines can do this faster, so why can't AA? One can only guess they don't really care. Avoid AA. There are options out there.

It was complete chaos with staff shouting out various connecting flights for people to come through in a very cramped area, which I can only describe as a herding pen! Other flights arrived and travellers became aggressive towards each other as the situation was made worse by staff! It was a stressful dash to the far end of the airport once through security. This airport isn't the worst I have been to, but this was a bad experience.

For the Toronto-Shanghai flight boarding was relatively efficient despite being a full flight. Take off was on time and the same AVOD was available. Seats although small were comfortable. Beverage service began 45 minutes after take off accompanied by a small bag of pretzels. Supper was served approximately 1.5 hours after take off which consisted of either a pork or chicken option. I had the chicken in cream sauce with roasted potato carrot and green bean. Also each tray had a corn and iceberg lettuce salad a white bun and brownie for dessert. It was quite decent for airline food and certainly not the worst I've had travelling. The wine selection was decent too. At the halfway point a Nissin cup of noodles were served with a chicken finger sandwich on white bread with a pack of biscuits. Finally there for breakfast there was a choice between congee or eggs and sausage. I elected for the mushroom and chicken congee which was quite good.

When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour, which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long.

There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport. We had to book a flight to Tulsa where our family had to drive a long way to pick us up. This plane was also delayed for an hour for no apparent reason.

The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers.

Gate agent paged me and offered an exit row instead of my originally assigned Y class seat which was beside a mother and infant. Loved that the gate agent was so thoughtful. Last Minute upgrade purchased from YYC-OGG at an additional cost of $700. Enjoyed the flatbed for the 7 hr flight. Service was OK. Once meal service had concluded J class passengers would have to ask for whatever they wanted by accessing the forward galley were the crew congregated. No moving map on either flight however both flights operated onetime. Confirmed with crew that this may be the last season Air Canada mainline operates to Hawaii as Air Canada Rouge will take over this flying which will not offer flatbed seating.

Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando.

Total flying time was around 17.5 hours from Berlin which was the quickest we have ever done it in and good if you have kids. One thing to mention we did have quite a few families near us and the staff really looked after them which was good to see. gave them some toys cool lunch boxes with meals in them and a little play time etc. Plane to terminal is by bus in Doha but with their new airport which is almost finished being built I think it'll be a thing of the past.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Air Canada,1.0,Peter Clements,13th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Halifax to London Heathrow via Toronto. We booked a flight to London for my wife. We made sure it was the direct flight as well to make it easier for her. Also booked it early to make sure we got what we wanted. Near the departure date, we got an e mail to say that her itinerary was changed to via Toronto. I phoned the airline and they told me the flight had been taken off and said book another day or accept what you have. It was a take it or leave it situation. Of course we had to take it. So she endured a long and difficult day as she is less able and the connection was rushed and it was tough. Imagine her annoyance when she finally got to Heathrow to find the direct flight we previously booked arriving at much the same time! They also managed to lose her baggage! Contact with Air Canada customer service was difficult. No response to the web mail submission. Telephone calls just produced advice to resubmit the complaint - which I did and still no response. In the end I had to badger them on social media to get any contact. It took a week to get anything from them. Their response was that some time after taking our flight off, it was put back again and people who had that flight cancelled were not given the opportunity to return to that flight. So those who were wise enough to book early lost out, while those who booked late got what we were denied. They said that as a goodwill gesture they would offer us 15% discount on our next flight. Useless as we don't intend flying again this year.

Qatar Airways,5.0,J Barner,17th August 2017,âœ… Verified Review | Denpasar to Berlin via Doha in July 2017. This time I was lucky to get both legs on the A330-300 so I could avoid the Boeing 777-300 and cramped B787. The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles. My suggestion would be to choose the aircraft wisely if you have the option to do that.,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Berlin via Doha,July 2017,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2.0,no

One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us.

Southwest Airlines,9.0,Paul Davis,27th August 2013,Another pleasant set of flights on Southwest. BUF-LAS 737-700 LAS-BUF 737-800 (Sky interior with larger overhead bins). Got the seats with double leg room on both flights even with an A30/A37 boarding number. Glad I paid for Early-bird check-in. ($12.50 US each way). Bag drop a bit slow in BUF - can't understand why they don't have a dedicated bag drop line. All flights on time. Drink/snack service on all legs with an additional water service on the longer legs. Luggage delivered quickly at LAS and BUF. Already planning my next trip on Southwest.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,10.0,Hoang Van Hiep,11th January 2015,LH779 SIN-FRA with A380 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops. I like the A380 very much.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

By rude responses we would be answered with words such as ""cool"" and ""move"".

It has now hit the bottom. Travelling to Rome has been a disaster from the start. At online check in, i could not find seats next to my 9 year old son. I couldn't book his seat without paying extra 50$ (my seat was free because of skywards) on top of the 900$ premium cost of the ticket itself (seriously this is what you claim in your radio ads favouring families). Called the call center. First time i was told there are no seats available (yet the app shows seats on rows 22, 23, 36 and 50). The second time I was told these seats are not eligible for children (seriously? bassinet seats not eligible?) and third time i was asked for 90$ to change my seats. Bottom line, no longer worth the premium paid. It used to be worth every cent extra, now even FlyDubai offers a better service (and you dont even pay for seats at check in!)

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Natalie Tan,10th January 2016,"London to Singapore via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, and a 22 hour delay on the ground. Outbound to London, everything went excellent - service by attendants and minimal delays taking off and landing. When I fell asleep on the first leg from Singapore to Istanbul and couldn't find my glasses, the attendant was very helpful in searching for it, even ripping out the seat in case it was stuck there. Food was really good also, considering when I slept through meal service and by the time I woke up, the flight attendant told me that my meal wasn't fresh anymore so she gave me a business class vegetarian meal instead. However, on my inbound flight on New Year's Eve/day, everything was a mess! I showed up at Heathrow to hear of a flight delay. Supposedly 1 hour became four, then five hours due to snow. They could have updated the website or sent a courtesy email so I didn't have to spend 8 hours at the airport before take off. Landed in Istanbul after circling for 2 hours due to lack of landing spots and another 2 hours waiting on the runway. Missed my connecting flight of course, and had to queue for 2 hours to get rebooked and re-sorted out on my next flight back to Singapore. Total chaos there with 30 crying babies at any one time and very rude, sneaky men cutting in line and making offensive remarks when I didn't let them cut in behind/infront of me. Ground staff and customer service desperately need training on conflict resolution and soft skills. Finally got on my plane, yet after another 1:30 delay. In flight entertainment wasn't working and the attendant had to spend an hour trying to fix my console as the flight was completely full.

It was the little touches that made a difference like taking a Polaroid of the kids for them to take as a souvenir, or wearing ""Happy New Year"" head gear as we were flying on New Years Eve. Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didn't feel claustrophobi, probably as the plane's walls don't curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasn't working properly - plus the system was trying to offer too much (i.e. loads of films) without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it.

I'm 5'4"" and 135 pounds so if I can't fit in a seat - something is drastically wrong! And I couldn't get comfortable - the flights to/from Europe were each 12 hours of misery. How greedy could AC be as to try to fit in that many seats? The plane is already super-efficient - so having an aisle seat is awful - you will constantly get your elbows arms and feet banged by the flight attendants. Add to that - the washrooms are so small I couldn't even fit in. And the toilet seats refuse to stay up!

American Airlines,1.0,B Merchant,9th October 2015,"I had booked American Airlines travel in advance for myself and family well in advance of our trip at a fairly decent rate. a month before travel, the airline removed a flight from our plan. After trying to find a flight to get us home, I booked one with Southwest (who I've never had issues with, props to them), and asked for a partial refund of the flight I wasn't taking with them. They refused. Gave me the run around with customer relations, then got told to request a partial refund with the refunds department, which I did, and then all my flights were canceled. I was then forced to rebook my trip at a higher cost of course. All the while, the admitted that their refunds department should not have canceled my flights. This trip ended up costing me almost $1000 more than my original booking. They didn't care. I waited until I returned from my trip to request again the money I'm out. After writing 6 letters to the top 6 executives with AA, I once again received a customer relations email (auto-response) that tells me I again, won't be granted a refund.

However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response.

I didn't know that number of bags reduced from 4 to 3 and the front desk people asked me to arrange bags and charged me 10lb extra weight fee of $50 and verified my cabin bag weight(8kg). After cleared the security, I bought some duty free stuffs from Chicago ORD airport and there is no question in Chicago airport boarding.After I reached Dubai when I board Chennai Airport Emirates staff asked me to weight cabin bag and duty free stuff and they said everything has to be placed in the cabin bag. They kicked out me out of the queue and asked me to arrange my luggage. I spent 10-15 minutes to arrange everything. After arranging every stuffs they said my cabin is overweight (includes duty free stuff). They suggested to reduce weight by throwing some stuff in trash or return duty free stuffs. Since the duty free stuffs I bought from US I couldn't able to return and they said I need to pay fee then only they can let me in. Staff behavior is totally not unacceptable, Emirates staffs are trying to steal money from customers my saying you have addition weight on your luggage. Staffs didn't say anything about the price detail and they charged me USD120 which more than the dutyfree stuff/10lb extra weight. Finally I saw my card was Charged $120 for $80 dollar stuff. This is my worst travel experience ever. If you have a policy then why are you allowing the duty free in ORD airport and not Dubai. If the duty free stopped in ORD airport I would have returned in ORD airport. Since the duty free stuffs are allowed in ORD I couldn't able to return in Dubai and I am force to pay. I am returning back to US today and restricted my baggage today to avoid any confusion but there is no cabin baggage verification or weight check happened today. Few of the economy passengers have both Cabin luggage and back pack and some of them have cabin luggage, back pack and Duty free from Dubai but no one was checking.

American Airlines,1.0,Scott Giller,25th June 2018,"Not Verified | Miami to Minneapolis. This was my first and last time flying American Airlines. I was scheduled to depart from MIA Friday at 5:40pm to land in Charolette where I then had a direct flight back to MSP. My scheduled arrival time in MSP was 12:20am Saturday. We started the boarding process where group 1 was starting to board. Then an announcement was made that there was a flat tire on the plane and they needed an hour to replace the tire. Half hour later we had a weather delay, no big deal its weather not their fault. After the weather cleared the work on the tire never started and another announcement was made that they needed an hour to fix the tire. These series of delays caused connection issues with other travelers and my connection was now in jepordy. After the repairs were made and driving around on the runway we finally departed at 9:40pm. We landed in Charolette around 1045pm, my flight to MSP left 20 min before I landed. After talking with an employee about needing to get home I had to spend the night in a questionable hotel that American Airlines paid for and gave me a $12 meal voucher. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30am (Same time I should have landed back home). Instead of having a direct flight from CLT to MSP I had to fly to ORD at 9:40am then land at MSP by 3:05pm. No issues flying to ORD (I was shocked), but now another issue with the plane. After the plane arrived from Las Vegas we started boarding again by calling group 1 then announcing we had to delay because of fluid leaking in the engine. Another delay of 1 hour. The announced that the plane had to be decommissioned and a new plane had to be brought in as a replacement. We finally took off from ORD around 3pm (Again the same time I should have been home). All the delays and setbacks caused my fees in the parking ramp to skyrocket. My overall experience with American Airlines was horrible. I have never been part of so many delays and questioned the overall safety of planes by one fleet. If a plane landed that had fluid leaking in an engine shouldn't that have set off an alarm? Why would they try and board knowing there was an issue on the plane? Also the on flight entertainment is the same level as Spirit airlines, there is none. Only if you want to burn through you phone battery which is an extremely valuable resource when flying American Airlines and can't call your family to tell them you are delayed...again.

Qatar Airways,1.0,Mohamed Tadkar,29th December 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Washington to Doha. I had an award ticket and wanted to change the date on my return. I have modified my ticket in the past during previous holidays and it was a relatively easy process usually completed with a single phone call to Qatar Airways customer service. I called Qatar Airways and the representative informed me that I should contact the Privilege Club department, as Qatar Airways does not deal with award tickets. I called the Privilege Club department which informed me that I need to submit my request using their online contact center. If this wasnâ€™t already a convoluted process, the automatic response to my request from the contact center was that I had to wait 3 business days before my request could be tended to. How is this practical when a customer needs to make an urgent change? My request was simple - I just wanted to know what dates were available for me to change my return ticket to and what the cost of implementing such a change would be. The response I finally received three business days later, was a generic one that did not even address my request. They replied stating that a change would cost $25 if completed 24 hours or more prior to departure and $100 if within 3 and 24 hours of departure. However, they did not provide me with any answer as to what dates were available for me to change my award ticket to. Not only did I have to wait for 3 business days to receive a response, but the response I received was completely unhelpful and useless. Having to wait 3 business days to get a response is unreasonable, especially when the responses are not helpful. My case was an urgent one and could not wait a week, let alone three business days. attempted to contact someone from the Privilege Department on Friday and was told that my request would be expedited. I tried to follow up the next day but because it was a Saturday, the offices were closed. I tried to call on Sunday and was informed that the office was closed. What is the point of being a privilege club member if the customer helpline is not open on Saturdays and Sundays while the general Qatar Airways customer service helpline is? I would rather be a standard, non-privilege customer and receive more reliable and timely customer service, than be a privilege club customer and have to wait days upon days for anything that even remotely resembles a response.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Doha,December 2018,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no

Emirates,1.0,G Somlai,5th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Budapest to Colombo via Dubai. If I can name the most child hating airline, than Emirates must be the one. It was 4 flights but each and everyone was a nightmare. We travelled with our 1 year old son. He was offered food on 1 of the 4 flights only. We weren't asked even once if the baby is all right, if we need any help but we were harassed several times instead. The seats were uncomfortable and narrow, the on-flight entertainment hardly worked, once the screen was broken, once it was frozen and had to be restarted, once the console were broken, 3 different flights, 3 different problems. The utensils were dirty in the sealed pack and the food were terrible but hey it's economy so this would be least problem of ours. All in all the staff was probably the rudest it can be, we hardly met any kindness or smiles, although they cooled down the aircraft to something between 15 and 10 C degrees they arrogantly collected all the blankets way before landing so we almost frozen to death. At least it made us understand why some people are flying in winter jackets near the equator.

I get to the airport and they delay my 8:50 pm flight about 6 times, to the point where it's 1 AM. They tell everyone the flight is cancelled because they cannot find a pilot. On top of randomly canceling the flight after the many delayed, they do not bother to accommodate us with a voucher for a taxi back home or a hotel. They just simply said to call the airline and book another flight. Not to mention how rude and unprofessional one of the ladies at the gate was. When I asked her for information on booking the next flight she gave me an attitude and didn't even answer my question. When I called their customer service phone number and spoke to a supervisor he as well spoke to me in a very unprofessional manner and seemed very careless to hear anything of what I had to say. He didn't bother finding me any sort of accommodation either. It was so unfair that I had to drive to the airport in the terrible weather, to 5 hours later be told the flight is cancelled. And then that I had to pay for my own transportation back home. There were so many angry customers because everyone was pretty much stuck st the airport and United Airlines refused to help!

I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no

The overall seat was superior to anyone else's business class I have been on. The food and beverage service was excellent. Appetizing decent portions well served and proper temperature.

Fast forward to today when we used the United Airline app to check in and download our boarding passes. Once we had gotten them and started to look them over guess what we found out? Our seats had been changed. When we called to verify we were told by someone not speaking very good English that since the plane was changed our seats had to be changed. I asked if this plane had seats 3A and 3B on it. We were told that indeed it did, but those were already occupied. We were then told that we agreed to ""any necessary changes in planes or seat assignments"" when we agreed to the ""terms and conditions"" of our ticket purchase. Since we don't have any way of changing airlines at such a late date we will have to live with not sitting in the same row as we had planned. This is the second time in as many first class flights that United has done this to us. I guess someone paid more money or had better connections then we did.

Virgin America,10.0,P Rass,22nd December 2015,"I was flying with Virgin America today and I was impressed. The seat comfort was amazing. Being 6/7, flying is not always easy. However, VA had lots of space for my legs and seats felt like being made for my size. It felt very comfortable. Even the headrest was high enough (which did not happen to me yet and I am a frequent flyer). Neither Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and others had this comfort. The entertainment system offered everything you wanted. Movies, music, games, food and drink orders. In general, the plane seemed very modern. When ordering a gin tonic (the 50ml gin bottle was told to cost 8$, which is a regular price for short haul flights) they offered me 2 for 1 bottles. Soda was free. As I bought my ticket via Skypicker and had a connection flight, I cannot tell how much the single flight was which makes it difficult to state anything about value for money. Ground service was very solid and friendly, no complaints. Cabin staff could have been a little bit more friendly. When I was asking for an emergency exit seat (one emergency exit row was kept empty as any passenger could upgrade their seat for $150, which I think is a lot, especially having that great seat comfort, which I did not know at that time), the cabin staff was not overly friendly, however, they have not been rude at any time. Altogether, I would absolutely recommend Virgin America, at least when they are using the plane I was flying in.

United Airlines,1.0,G Calezzi,23rd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Anchorage to Rio de Janeiro via Chicago / Panama. I bought a ticket flight with United a long time ago and I choose United because of the short duration of the flight and short layover between the flights. Less than 1 month to the trip I received an email with a flight change using Copa Airlines flights. It was added another connection increasing my overall flight trip for more than 6 hours. The trip hours doesnâ€™t make sense: I would arrive in Chicago at 11 am but my next flight time would be at 9 am from Chicago to Panama, which means I would arrive in Chicago 2 hours late for the next flight. (they sent it to me - company huge mistake with time sense) I called to customer service to try to fix it and they offered another ticket with 16hours of a layover or the reimbursement of the ticket! How I would find another international ticket in so short notice with a good price and good conditions of time flight? I asked to talk with the manager that was not flexible at all and said that I must accept the conditions of the changes otherwise the only thing they can do it is reimbursement. However, that was not a simple change condition... that was a huge mistake with time flight. I couldnâ€™t get a plane that had already left because I flight that they added. I would miss the connection because of a United airline mistake. The manager was not doing anything to try to fix my problem and she said that: â€œ in my end, there is no more I can doâ€. I had to accept their change offer conditions resulting in a more 7 hours of increase in my overall flight trip. By the end of the call, the manager was impolite on her manners with an angry tone of voice.

Air New Zealand,3.0,Don Welch,30th August 2016,"Wellington to London via Hong Kong. I am a Kiwi expat, have lived in London for 17 years and have used Air New Zealand many times over the years when returning to NZ to see family. I have to say that gradually, over time, I believe the airline has fallen into the trap of believing its own PR. The first thing you hear when you get on a flight these days is about the latest award the airline has won. While there have been upgrades over the years to the fleet, in-flight entertainment and recently check-in procedures (more on this later), the personal touch and focus on service that made the airline stand out, are no longer as obvious and seem to be replaced with a slightly superior cockiness that is not that attractive. Over recent flights Air New Zealand have dropped a brand new solid suitcase on its corner, stoving it in. When I complained (which was extremely time consuming and difficult), I was told the suitcase still works fine so Air New Zealand were not going to offer anything by way of remediation. Lost our luggage between Auckland and Wellington (via the high tech new check-in procedure). When I registered concern on the return flight I was told by a cocky attendant that Air New Zealand doesn't lose luggage so I must have been on another airline!). Ironically when we registered our lost luggage we were in a not insignificant queue and the ground staff gave the impression that this was a very frequent event. On my last trip, 4 out of 6 flights on the return journey from London to Wellington were late, one of which arrived very late in Auckland which required a group of transferring passengers to run from domestic to international to make the next flight. This caused stress and anxiety. While I am sure Air New Zealand would say that some of the causal factors are out of its control, I think it is the general air of disinterest mixed with self congratulatory arrogance that puts me off the most. Will I continue to use Air New Zealand - well possibly because the network of flights to and from the UK is generally very convenient in terms of door to door elapsed travel time. But I certainly don't feel as patriotic and loyal towards the airline as I used to and I certainly check out other flight options a lot more than I used to.",Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,WLG to LHR via HKG,August 2016,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,no

American Airlines,10.0,B Klein,30th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I was on flight to Charlotte from Munich via London. My plane from Munich was already delayed due to weather, so my 1.5hr layover in London for a USA flight was cut down to 40 minutes (in which I needed to change Terminals, go thru security and get to the other side of the airport). My American Airlines flight which left on February 22 at 1:30 pm was already closing, so I had started to run. I finally arrived, out of breath and about to collapse. The gate lady let me quickly run across the hall to purchase a bottle of water before I dehydrate. Finally on the plane. I sat a good 10 minutes in stillness, trying to catch my breath. I wanted to get comfortable and ""set up"" for a transatlantic flight when I noticed that I had lost my cellphone! I ran up to the stewardess and explained my situation. She calmed me well, but explained that I couldnt leave the plane. Another staff came up and inquired what was wrong. I told them I needed to leave and get my phone, thinking I hopefully left it by the gate or the small store across the hall. He walked out and some minutes later returned with my phone. My vacation was saved and I couldn't thank him enough. Both of those flight attendants had done such an awesome job at calming and fixing the whole ordeal. I flew again with AA on my return trip on March 6th to London and they were my attendants again! It was wonderdul to see them again. I will always recommend American Airlines.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Charlotte,March 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

So, many people were waiting when the counter opened. The flight was fine, cabin crew pleasant and food OK. I had an empty seat next to me and was comfortable. The seatback entertainment system was very good. A downside to Aeromexico is that when you change planes in Mexico City, you have to collect your luggage, go through Mexico immigration and customs, recheck your luggage and go through security again before you can go to the departure gate for your connecting flight. This is time consuming and somewhat inconvenient. The flight MEX to LAX on a Boeing 787 was very pleasant and on-time.

We check in at the personal check in because we are flying as a family and I have car seats.

However on the way back I was directed to the kiosk checking only and I got annoyed because I wanted to check in with a person so we could change our seats. They refused and said I had to use the kiosk no exceptions. They said I had to go upstairs after security at the actual gate. So I went up there and asked them to arrange the seats so each parent could sit with a kid but they said the flight was full and they could not change seats. I told them my departure flight was the same way and they were able to change my seats but the person refused to do so. So I got mad and just left and let it be.

But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing, as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate, cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free Wi-Fi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top.

Even though a code share flight they couldn't give me my AC boarding passes and told me my luggage would go through to Montreal but I had to check in at AC in Istanbul. Too many people scheduled to be an A320 switched to a A340 at last minute leading to delays leaving Izmir. Arrived in Istanbul we were taken to a remote stand and finally bussed to the domestic terminal. Dashed to the international terminal reps for AC were waiting all smiles and no problems got my two remaining boarding passes. Massive line at immigration control to leave. I went to the front and asked some people if they would let me go ahead as my flight had already started to board. Just made it to my flight to Toronto. Once on board a perfect as a flight in economy could be. Excellent flight attendants professional and friendly. Drinks then a wonderful meal of lamb. Plenty of water runs snack part way through self service drinks and snacks in galley. Another meal 1.5 hrs before landing chicken again excellent. B767 had been refurbished excellent seats comfortable and entertainment system first rate with plenty of choices. Bags didn't make it to YYZ Turkish Airlines fault but AC was very good about getting them to me in Ottawa to my hotel 2 days later. Transfer to YUL smooth good short flight.

Crew was helpful and unlike other Turkish Airlines flights I've taken, they were able to have an actual conversation in English. I bought in flight WiFi (for 14.99$US) and it worked well throughout the flight.",A330,Business,Economy Class,Istanbul to Montreal,January 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Candace Burns,11th January 2015,Flew round trip Houston to Honolulu in Business Class costing over $6000.00. The seats didn't recline enough to sleep comfortably. The foot rest was manual and difficult to operate. The seat was not as wide as a normal business class seat. There was no TV monitor only wifi via the United app and your personal screen device. No one on the flight was aware of needing a personal device on the flight. There were no outlets available to charge a personal device if you had one and the wifi kept going out. The selection of movies was not current. Older movies and TV shows were the only thing available. The meals were awful pasta and sauce and a burrito the return flight had the same offerings other than a pathetic breakfast sandwich with paper thin ham. No amenity kit was offered on the red eye return flight. There was nothing upgraded or business class about this flight. I do not recommend this airline for the trip to Honolulu from Houston.,,,Business Class,,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Delta Air Lines,5.0,Susan Curry,29th March 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | This flight was booked through Virgin but they didn't do flights from Manchester to New York, so they use Delta Air Lines. My daughter and I were sat on seats behind the seats where the exits were and it was very cold as is usual. The blankets provided were not adequate to keep out the cold even though we had a couple each. The seatbelt sign was on for a while after take off but people were walking up and down and the staff didn't say anything to them. The exit area was blocked with litter but the staff did not make any attempt clear it away. The food was not worth eating, it was cold, dry and hard. I felt as though I was flying with a second rate airline, the cabin staff didn't speak and look thoroughly miserable.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Osman Gulseven,3rd August 2014,June 18-21. Ankara (ESB) to Istanbul (IST) and to Rome Fiomicino (FCO).TK 2109 and TK 1965. I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for about 10 years. Mostly I enjoy excellent flights. Luggage is rarely lost. Out of 100+ flights it happened once which was likely due to a non-Turkish Airlines connection. Food is halal and of top quality. Most of the fleet is brand new. Once in a while you get an old one which makes the flight experience mediocre. The miles program is great but they started reducing the number of miles that can be earned. One thing annoying is the in-flight announcement. The pilots better stay silent instead of trying to speak with their low- level English.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,Brian E Smith,9th March 2015,Flew Business Class from NRT to BCN (via AMS) in seat 4E of the updated 747-400 aircraft. Besides this plane being ancient and the fact that I felt sorry for all the people by the windows with no direct aisle access I had a terrifically smooth flight. I had heard about and seen photos of odd dishes served but not on this flight. All food throughout the flight was delicious plentiful and served on interestingly designed dishware. Previously I experienced some plastic items but not this time. The AVOD was OK but did not have as recent offerings as their partner Delta and the quality of the large screen was milky. The seat was surprisingly soft and was comfortable in any position including lie flat. The toilets were cleaned throughout and FA were always available in the galley with smiles. The FA were remarkably genial and good at their jobs. There were two toilets dedicated to all of business class and I never once saw an economy passenger try to enter. Overall I loved my flights. The connection on a 737-700 was more of the same with continued good service and food though the intra-Europe seats are not that comfortable.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,,Mark Evans,8th January 2014,London Heathrow to Odessa (Ukraine) return. The only positive was that the leg room is actually fairly decent. However: Online check in is a time consuming and laborious process. It is a completely pointless exercise as we had to queue for almost an hour to have the ground crew re-check us in for the flight and take our bags. Staff both on the ground and in the air were surly and miserable. My seat on the flight from LHR-IST was broken and did not lock in any position which was deeply uncomfortable. On the same flight my partner's TV was broken and did not work at all. It took the flight crew almost 1 hour 40 minutes to serve a drink. Transfer arrangements in Istanbul can only be described as a complete and utter shambles. No clear directions people everywhere being funnelled into a small security check area. On the way home we were told to go and join another random queue for a further passport check. Whilst at the gate in IST the flight to Odessa was delayed by an hour with no staff whatsoever in sight. The planes are filthy both inside and out.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,no
Qatar Airways,1.0,T Eldem,18th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Johannesburg to Montreal via Doha with Qatar Airways. Arrived at the check-in counter only to find it not open despite it being 3 hours before the departure time. Following check-in which offered no hint of a problem, I proceeded to the lounge first and then the gate close to the scheduled departure time. At 30 minutes to departure there was no aircraft and no sign of ground agents which was the first sign of a pending problem. After the agents showed up and at around the scheduled departure time, the electronic boards showed a gate change but the gate agents could not confirm it. Eventually, all passengers made their way to the new gate where we were told the plane had a technical issue but it was almost resolved meaning we would board shortly. As minutes ticked away, this story changed multiple times and finally at midnight the station manager showed up to tell all of us that the flight was cancelled. What unfolded after can only be described as pandemonium with 200+ passengers many of which had already missed their connecting flights from Doha demanding answers from the ground agents who seemed to be unable to provide straight answers. All passengers were bussed to nearby hotels and many of us are getting to our destination 24 hours later than planned.

In the end we had a delay of 06.49 hrs. No compensation, no proper information, no special care, just sitting in the lounge. The flight SU 204 was okay, no idea how the meals were, too tired.

Alitalia,1.0,J Kanser,10th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | On 9 December 2016 I bought a very cheap business class ticket from Florence to Bangkok via Paris and returning via Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf for flights operated by Air France and Etihad but with Alitalia flight numbers and an Alitalia ticket number. A week later I received a phone call from the agency where I bought the ticket. I was told that Alitalia had changed my reservation and that I should contact it. I checked online and indeed Alitalia had changed my reservation to a one-way flight from FLR to DUS via FCO with the departure on 12 Jan. My original departure was to be on 11 Jan. I contacted Alitalia, which was not easy - their HQ in Italy can only be contacted by phone or fax which makes it difficult to launch a written complaint and thus prevents you from acquiring any written evidence of communication in case you may need it. I wrote an email to their Customer Relations Office in the Czech Republic (which can only be contacted by email or fax). I received a reply with a phone number inviting me to call them. Only after I asked for a written reply to my complaint, my claim was registered and I received a claim number. On the phone I was told that there was an error in their reservation system which made it possible to book flights from FLR to DUS with unusual routings and because they made a mistake, I am not going to Bangkok. So far my claim has not been resolved.

Both Cityhopper flights were excellent â€“ no hassle quick decent snack and good attendants. Transfer going out was a bit tight but comfortable with a brisk walk and knowing your way through Schiphol. Boeing 747 to SFO was a little dated the IFE in my seat didn't work due to a broken audio input socket (not ideal on an 11 hour flight!). Luckily the gentleman on the aisle agreed to move to the only remaining seat on the plane had this not happened I think I would have lost my mind with boredom. Flight attendants were great - brought us a couple of glasses of champagne from Business Class for our honeymoon which was a nice touch. The journey back from Dulles was a different experience. Modern 330 again good selection of IFE. Cabin crew weren't particularly friendly - gave the impression of doing the bare minimum didn't want to ask for anything extra. Food was also a lot better going out than on return Our transfer at Amsterdam was scheduled to be 50 minutes between flights however with our first flight being 10 mins late and with taxiing etc we only made our flight to Leeds by 4 minutes with a sprint through Schiphol. There was no help in the terminal available or information to help us get there and the KLM staff at the gate made us to feel it was our fault we nearly missed the connection. The luggage wasn't so lucky â€“ no apology was given but they did arrive at our home in Leeds later that day.

We were served a complimentary snack and offered non-alcoholic beverages with free re-fills. Boarding was efficient. My only quirk with Southwest is that they do not have assigned seating hence getting a preferred seat is tricky unless you pay the extra $10 and get early boarding.

Emirates,5.0,W Peters,14th June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Good journey from Manchester to Dubai. Had a 1hr 25min connection time for our flight to Bangkok. When we got to Dubai the plane seemed to take an age to park up, the pilot said that there was a slight delay as waiting for a slot. We stopped, and were bussed off: why does such a modern airport have to bus people off such a large modern aircraft? Eventually got on to our bus. Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal, people around us even joked that we're going straight into town, it just kept driving & driving. I've never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off, an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says 'you better run for it!' So we run for it, two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty, no time for water or coffee, & angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help, point the way etc, we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot, thirsty and angry. The staff on the plane were really nice and gave us some water.

Staff theree organised by boarding pass for SYD-MEL on Virgin Australia. while I had cold glass of orange juice in their 'lounge'. Whisked through security with a minimum of fuss and went upstairs to the lounge. That was modern and spacious with enough variety in the beers, spirits and wines. Lounge had shower facilities, Wifi was very fast. However, the food on offer is far below what is available in the lounges in the TBIT. Boarded about 20 minutes late then sat for an eternity before takeoff. Left LAX an hour late which we did not catch up on the 14 hour flight which was probably due to head winds. Meal after takeoff was poor so I left it and went to sleep. Lie flat beds are ok, if a little narrow. Pyjamas, two pillows and a great duna provided me with the creature comforts and enabled me to sleep for ten hours. I had seat 9A which was tucked away in the back of the first section. It seemed to be more private than the other seats. As mentioned in my earlier review, I am not a fan of the reverse herringbone layout. I'd prefer either herringbone or the more traditional forward seating. Breakfast was just OK.

Delta was the only airline with lines longer than space available for lines on both legs of the trip, so clearly it's a consistent and internal issue.

American Airlines,3.0,Martin Tune,21st August 2015,"Poor overall compared with other flights, particularly the BA one we got from Manchester to Heathrow then to Washington on the way out to the US. The flight was delayed overall by at least an hour, we spent the majority of the delay time sat waiting to set off due to a ""Minor repair"" which was announced by the pilot over the tannoy once we were on board quite some time later. Our delay continued probably due to missing our take off slot, it wasn't clear because no-one really explained what was happening. Within this time period, the cabin crew turned up and suggested we should move to another seat, we'd been settled into our seats for 20-25 minutes and had chosen seats towards the rear of the plane close to the toilets. When we tried to reserve a seat together before flying, it was fairly limited at the time and we were happy enough to be here however the lady suggested they'd be making a lot of noise behind us and would probably be bashing about around the seats as it appeared they'd used up the back row for their stuff and seating, we said this was OK initially but she continued to prompt us to move, we started to do so with us having to start moving and packing up our stuff, there wasn't much in the way of help on offer and we were made to feel like we were causing more of an inconvenience by booking ahead to get our seats, no suggestion of where were going was made initially which resulted in us moving without our stuff and in the end all the confusion and messing about just raised our stress levels. It appeared in the end that some of the cabin crew had taken up the seats around us and thankfully some of the crew, particularly one of the younger female crew members and another gentleman were very courteous and offered help with a clearly very upset passenger, the other more senior staff could do to perhaps follow their lead as their idea of customer service was far below expected. Aside from this, this particular plane had screens above rather than individual ones on the back of the seats, one film was offered, food was OK, same usual fare, I assume from the amount of chatter about drinks I heard that there was a shortage of certain drinks, particularly beer at one point. Generally, I'm disappointed as this is one of the longest and one of the most expensive flights I've been on. I've flown on the more notoriously bad budget airlines and still found that despite all the shortcomings at least the staff seem to care and they also seem to be a bit more apologetic about late flights, I don't think I'd use American Airlines again if there was another choice.",Boeing 767-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to Manchester,August 2015,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,no

Qatar Airways is very uneven, it sets standards with things like the Qsuites and with frequent outstanding service, some flights below average. Marrakech to Doha had the type of cabin crew for which US and low grade European airlines are better known. Doing the minimum, serving a meal in a totally indifferent way, then disappearing behind a curtain not to be seen for the remainder of the flight. The bar counter at the back of the Business cabin was left depleted and dirty, not once in over 4 hours did the crew check on passengers and enquire about drinks. Only during the last hour or so did they reappear to offer, unenthusiastically, drinks or snacks. The food was good, but with a service expedited as quickly as possible (the cabin was full or almost). The wines have recently taken a dive for the worse.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Marrakech to Doha,February 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Kyle Stock,7th January 2016,"Pittsburgh to San Diego via LAX. The worst consumer experience of my life. My flight for Tuesday morning was canceled at midnight. 3 hours on the phone, with numerous people telling me I'll be delayed for 3+ days. Finally at 3am, a supervisor finds me a flight leaving in a couple hours. Hustle to the airport and the lines are crazy at 5am. Not enough employees and the logistics were terrible. Fast forward and I arrive home in San Diego. My luggage didn't join me. I went to the baggage office and it turns out the check-in person in Pittsburgh put the wrong code on my bag. I filed the appropriate claim. Fast forward 5 days, no bag arrives at my home. Now, I've spent the last 2 days listening to terrible elevator music for 4+ hours on hold with ""central baggage services"" without hearing a human voice.

The staff that greeted us were very polite and pointed us towards our seats. The plane did not have any monitors but was fittied with wifi. Only issue with the wifi is that it doesn't work over the pacific so doesn't matter. This isn't United's fault but with the wifi provider. There was no food offered on this flight but got the stroopwafel and drinks. I love the waffel so I didn't complain and asked for one more. We were also given a blanket which was nice because the plane did get a bit chilly as our flight was early morning. Once, we took off the flight was bump free and smooth as it got. I have been on many flights and have done this flight numerous times with many airlines. This flight had to be the smoothest I have been on. Overall the only thing I wish they had was actual food on the flight and working wifi but the latter cant be blamed on United.

Air Canada,3.0,Sarah Wolfe,23rd November 2015,"I am not one to usually write a negative review, however my last 3 experiences with Air Canada have been very disappointing. My partner and I have flown to Phoenix, St Lucia, and NYC all within the last year. We have not had one vacation without a significant delay on either the departure, arrival, or both. Tonight we were delayed by 6 hours. The delays, such as this evening, have been due to mechanical issues. I can appreciate valuing everyone's safety, however the volume and length of delays has forced us to view Air Canada as unreliable. We have missed out on nights of hard-earned vacations, and even worse, time spent with family. A few food vouchers for airport food, at airport food prices is simply not sufficient for the repeated inconvenience and frustration we have experienced. Air Canada has told us on many occasions that they appreciate our business, however they have certainly missed opportunities to show us. We will be reluctant to use or recommend Air Canada again - we require a company we can trust and rely on.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,YYZ to LGA,November 2015,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,no

This time was no exception. I took two flight over the last week. All the fights left on time and arrived early. Check in process in Athens airport was fine and no big line ups. The check in agent even manages to tag my bags to my final destination with a partner airline and they did follow. The crew on all the flights were nice and welcoming. They even helped to make space and store carry on bags in the overheard compartments so the flight could leave as soon as possible. They even hand out candy before take off which makes a nice touch of a warm Greek welcome. There's a complementary meal or snack provided depending on the flight time with a selection of drinks. Aegean Airlines is one the best airlines and the service has improved a lot over the past years. The only downside is that they don't operate flights to the USA or Canada.

Virgin America,1.0,David Harrington,4th December 2009,SFO-LAX-JFK. I had high hopes for this carrier and I even flew them an extra leg as part of a connection to see what they were like. The problem with Virgin America is Cabin crew. There was nothing friendly about the flight. I smiled to one of the crew on boarding and he just looked away. There are only 3 members on each flight 2 in economy and the lead flight attendant spends most time in First class. The flight to LAX left 40mins late and just made the connection. Paying $20 for a 10kg bag is a joke and the way the ground crew were witnessed to be treating out luggage will further refrain me from using this carrier. Virgin America were also in no means cheap especially after baggage fees. I flew another Low cost carrier on the return and the difference was amazing.

Greeted with indignance at Bangkok Lounge which was my very first impression of Emirates having flown Singapore and Qatar many times. Comfortable lounge. On board brand new A380-800 was comfortable with all the latest gadgets. Food ok and wine list a credit to the selectors except for Champagne. Why would you choose such a large House as Moet which seems totally out of balance with the rest of the wine selections? Friendly service although not as professional as Singapore and Qatar. HKG-BKK on an older A380 was a real experience. Seats feel more cramped than the new version although I have read they are the same width. Nowhere to put your arms when reclining and it feels like a very cramped space. Food was downright awful and service was staff who in their attempt to be over friendly and hip just got it wrong. I would much pefer to pay the extra money for Singapore and Qatar where I am almost guaranteed of a better experience. Upon disembarkation the staff were very rude.

United Airlines,3.0,D James,20th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew UA895, 12/16/16 from Hong Kong to San Francisco, then UA 638 from San Francisco to Houston. UA895 was 12 hours long, and was advertised as having inflight entertainment and wifi when I booked it. The aircraft was old, so it had no personal TVs on the back of the chairs, just the main one near bulkhead. Not a big deal, but about 45 minutes into the flight, we were told the WiFi wasn't working. They tried resetting it, then called tech support, but could not fix it. We were told that because it was considered a ""premium"" item, we wouldn't be compensated. I didn't expect compensation, but on a 12 hour flight, I expected some effort to be made to make everyone more comfortable. Instead, there were 4 children in our cabin and they took turns crying for the entire 12 hours. I understand kids cry, and I felt terrible for the parents, they looked fatigued. The kids would only stop crying when the parents walked the aisles with them or stood where they could see the TVs, which obviously wasn't sustainable for a multitude of reasons. I imagine the flight would've been much more enjoyable for the parents, children, and other passengers if the wi-fi had worked. Additionally, even the entertainment on the screen near bulkhead crashed mid flight and had to be re-set, so even that was flawed. My second flight, UA153, was scheduled to depart at 12:05pm. At first it was delayed by 20 minutes, ""due to delayed incoming aircraft."" I decided to look it up, and saw that the flight, UA424, Dulles to San Francisco, was originally scheduled from 08.50-12.06. Yes, the scheduled landing was for 1 minute after our flight was scheduled to depart. This is a terrible planning failure on behalf of United, who knowingly scheduled a flight they knew wasn't going to depart at the scheduled time. Our flight didn't end up departing until close to 2pm, after loading up around 1.15, and then taxiing for a long time. Multiple people on our flight had connecting flights, which were missed or they narrowly made it to, especially since United didn't accommodate or prioritize their exit from the aircraft. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing that United knowingly did this. There were over 100 people on the aircraft, all delayed an extra 1.5-2 hours, plus the people who missed their connecting flights and were even further delayed. United wasted 200+ hours of people's time that day. It seems extremely fraudulent that they knowingly did this. Last, I'm taking time to write this review this time, as every time I have flown United, I have experienced a delay of at least 1 hour. It is extremely disappointing as a customer. For example, on our flight from ORD to HKG, we were delayed by almost 5 hours. On a flight I took from DFW to XNA once, I was delayed by 4 hours. Unfortunately, this just seems to be something you have to expect and plan for when flying United.","Boeing 747-400, Boeing 737-800.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HKG to IAH,December 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,no

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8.0,Y Kiselev,19th January 2011,"Oslo - Moscow - St Petersburg return. Fine crew meals and planes. Boarding in A319 in Oslo took some 40 minutes most of which were spent inside the aircraft waiting for other passengers to take their seats - thanks to lack of management and guidance from the cabin crew. Due to this arrived to Sheremetyevo D with a 35 minutes delay cutting my connection time down to 40 minutes. Passport control /customs very fast. Waited for luggage about 15 minutes. Ran to the transfer desk where two of the three staff said they can offer re-booking for a later flight to LED. However the third representative was extremely helpful did few phone calls to warn the gate that I am coming and basically ran with me through the corridors carrying my luggage to the LED flight gate. Unfortunately the flight to LED was delayed people were standing at the gate for 40 minutes hearing no info but only ""5 more minutes!"". Finally the gate personal announced cancellation of the flight and we were rescheduled for the flight departing in 2 hours. On the way back from St Petersburg everything went smoothly I even did not need to pick up my luggage at Sheremetyevo for customs clearance. Service and flights were just great. Aeroflot does change for the better but has to put more effort into ground staff training and customer service. English training for the crew is necessary as well. As for lack of smiles - I guess this is simply a cultural feature - Russians generally reserve smiles for situations of fun and/or pleasure and apparently Aeroflot staff do not feel much of either at work.",,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,4.0,yes

To the right of it is a channel serving a continual line of Turkish Airlines crew.

Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch. Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short.

Aegean Airlines,3.0,Michalis Kapsalis,4th March 2015,I booked to Abu Dhabi Business. One month before departure they informed me that my returned flight was canceled because Aegean had canceled all Abu Dhabi flights after November. I asked for a replacement ticket with their partner Etihad but they told me they can't do that. So they gave me some money back and made me buy another return ticket for 300 euros. The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers.

This is a business paid for flight. However I still think it is horrible the things I go through every time I fly American Airlines. They even canceled my return flight back to Birmingham without my knowing. It was taken care of however that was still a potential inconvenience. Today they loaded us on the plane. We sat on the plane for an hour, they tell us something is wrong. We have to walk out of the plane. We get back in they change our gate 3 times.

Turkish Airlines,3.0,Rossini Maitre,13th April 2014,I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed. They had no consideration for people's choice or diet preferences. You may get lucky but you may also dearly regret flying with them.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,no

Southwest Airlines,1.0,Michelle Kozubal,2nd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Chicago to Oakland. Southwest cancelled our flight going and coming home.

When they cancelled our flight flying out, I called and the customer service rep said my flight coming home would not be cancelled. It was and I was not able to get another flight for two days which was not possible due to a connecting flight. We had to go with another airline that could accommodate us. It cost allot of extra money and time. Southwest could have cared less. Then when I had to cancel the flight I booked two days later after I asked if I would get a full refund if I could get another flight, they tried to charge me anyway. It is unbelievable the lack of customer service they have provided this trip. Iâ€™m not understanding why they couldnâ€™t just get another plane to put all of these customers on and leave them where they are rather than just leave them with nothing to fin for themselves. As of now I am considering never flying with them again and cutting my southwest card up. They never once tried to make the situation better. Itâ€™s really sad they are treating their loyal customers this way. You need a better system Southwest when you cancel flights. For me personally, Iâ€™m scared to ever book a flight with you again.

Lufthansa,1.0,P Hester,19th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Toronto to Manchester via Frankfurt. The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'.

One of the exit lamps was playing up so the attendant whacked it with her hand - to no avail. Cabin crew were inattentive and appeared bored. This flight originated in Istanbul and flew to HCMC via Bangkok. Perhaps the crew didn't change in BKK? The plane was an older 777-300 and the seats looked like they needed a good scrub.

Emirates,3.0,B Lanner,15th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester.

Delta Air Lines,3.0,N Hiserote,4th December 2014,DL352 from Nashville to Detroit. Advised that the flight will be full and customers are allowed one personal item and one carry-on bag which must fit within the size check box. My carry-on was approximately 1 inch too wide due to my use of the one inch expansion zipper. So my option was to pay to have my bag checked or to use the other small duffle I had inside of my carry-on. So I basically carried on the same weight of items which now took up twice the amount of room.

I flew back with a low cost airline from Thessalonikiâ€¦the ticket was more expensive and of course nothing was offered to eat or drink.

I only fly United because they dominate the Newark airport, which happens to be the closest to my home. To be fair though, and to set aside all my prior experiences I will review the flight from a fresh slate. The aircraft, a 17 year old 777 with the old Continental interior. There was personal in seat IFE but it was slow and unresponsive. The movies that were available were recent and best sellers. I was very happy to see that the drink cart was busted out maybe 4 times during the flight and about every hour there was an FA distributing water. Flight was only about 20 minutes. Food itself was a choice between western and asian meal. To be honest, none of the meals were good. But what kills me the most about United is the horrible customer service, flight attendants are all rude and cold.

Flight from Istanbul to KL service-wise was flawless and seamless. Very attentive service needs were taken care of before you asked and very good food although I have had even better food on other THY flights. My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high. I wonder why Turkish a forward looking airline as using the A340-300 on the IST-KL run with this seating arrangement in business class.

Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,S Silver,22nd December 2014,"My family my husband and I and our two children ages 11 and 14 are well seasoned travelers. We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be. I do know that I will never fly Southwest again.",,,Economy Class,,,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,no
American Airlines,1.0,R Ehrlich,22nd July 2016,"I left last Monday from Oakland Airport with a stopover in Phoenix and then onto Omaha. Well, due to poor weather we circled Phoenix airport until we ran low on fuel. We were then informed we would be going to Tuscon to get more fuel, we landed in Tuscon and were assured repeatedly it wouldn't take much time and we'd back in Phoenix very soon. Long and short of it, there was a line of planes ahead of us. They would not allow anyone off and we sat there for about 2 hours before getting refueled while being told we were headed back to Phoenix shortly. No food, people missed connecting flights, I was forced to say overnight in Phoenix and missed a very important day of work in Omaha. American insisted they would not offer any compensation in terms of food, hotel, etc., since it was weather related. On top of I found out from another flyer the hotel rooms offered at a ""discount"" at the Red Lion Inn were actually more expensive than their regular prices. Waiting in American Airlines customer service line was horrible, took a long time (over an hour) with lots of angry people. By the time I got another flight the next day and a room I got 2 hours of sleep. I understand things happen with weather, but the way American Airlines handled this during and after was the worst flying experience I've had to date and I'm 57 years of age.

Came to find out that 10 people from our flight lost luggage. Several conflicting explanations were offered but after an hour we all left without our luggage. On our return flight was told after boarding that the only way to watch anything was by streaming thru our own devices and that we must download the United app. Of course that wasn't possible for the large number of attempts to access internet and App Store. Probably wouldn't complain but then we were delayed after we were seated. It was explained that they had no pilot or flight crew. Would drive to get us a flight crew and pilot ASAP. An hour after boarding we were told that the pilot Was at the airport and would begin preparing to leave. Still attempting to access App Store. I will never use United Airlines again!!

I arrived to the airport at 9am, and so I had an hour before the gates closed. Unfortunately it took 40 mins to find parking, and by the time I got to the check-in, I had 15 mins to spare. There was an agent chatting and paying no attention to customers, so given I had very little time left, I thought I'd use the self check-in machine. Those machines are not very user friendly at all! It wouldn't recognize the name of the city where I was staying and the name of the hotel. I was timed-out after trying 3 times, and only when I exasperated loudly did the check-in lady look up and nonchalantly say, ""If you're having trouble go over there."" Over there was the other end of the booths, where an agent seemed oblivious to her surroundings. By the time I rushed to her and handed my passport, she told me that I was late and wasn't going anywhere. Then she pointed out that I had a checked bag and so I was definitely not getting on this flight. I raised my voice out of despair, and explained to her that I had spent 15 minutes trying to figure out their machines. I was even the one who ""apologized"" saying it wasn't her fault. Instead of her apologizing for being inconvenienced by the airlines for whom she works, she had the nerve to look up at the other agent and ask her if I was telling the truth! She then told me she could get me on a flight that'll get me to Providence by 11:55PM. That's when I told I needed to be there in the afternoon because I had a rental. Of course, she wouldn't override the system and open the gate, claiming it was too late even though it was an hour before boarding.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Craig Mauk,2nd January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Delta Comfort+ from Springfield to Greenville via Atlanta. Flight delayed in Springfield 7 times. First explanation was a weather issue then changed to a maintenance issue then to a crew timed out issue at which point it became obvious it was nothing more than a lying issue. Connecting flight in Atlanta leaves on time at 10:29 pm, unfortunately we do not arrive until 11:30 pm. Directed to 3 different agent locations then to Baggage Claim area. Approximately 150 people standing in line at midnight after being stranded by Delta. After 2 hrs of standing we are close enough to make out the Delta employee stating that Delta will rebook your flight and nothing more. Someone asked about overnight accommodations and was told there were plenty of chairs in the terminal. Another person asked for a meal voucher and was told Delta does not provide meal vouchers. It was suggested that if anyone got a hotel room they could try to apply for up to $100 in reimbursement after the first of the year. After watching the Delta agents treatment of the customers in front of them and twice hearing an agent tell a customer they did not like their attitude and would have them arrested we exited the line. I am not adept at kissing someone's butt while they treat me like an animal and it had become apparent that Delta's agents were fully aware that passengers have no legal recourse against Delta and they did not hesitate to pass that along with a heaping serving of disdain and arrogance. During this fine example of ""Special Services"" Delta continued to be consistent with the emails telling me how sorry they were for the delay and how they care about their customers. New flight leaving 8:55 am next day. Delayed twice because the Flight attendants were reported by the gate attendant at 8:45 am as being in the airport but did not show up at the gate until after 9:30. Possibly they were in time out like the ones the day before. All in all our 6 hour flight only took 32 hrs to complete and the depths of Delta's incessantly repeated ""The most important connections we make aren't between places. They're between people"" really applies.",,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Springfield to Greenville via Atlanta,December 2018,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,8.0,Pierre LongprÃ©,29th January 2014,Originally meant to flu YUL-LGA/JFK-CDG on Dec 24th 2013 and CDG-JFK-YUL on Jan 5th 2014 but a lot of changes occurred! Our JFK-CDG was cancelled due to weather in Paris. Flight from YUL-LGA was finally cancelled at the gate they rescheduled us on Air Canada to BOS (CRJ50) then British Airways to LHR. AA agents were ok and all speck fluent French. On the BOS-LHR flight (B747-400) they put us in premium economy seating was good but meal disgusting. Arrived at LHR around 4.50am we had our CDG flight scheduled at 3pm but British Airways found places for us on an earlier flight (A320). Our return wasn't cancelled as we entered the plane a B757-200 wifi- equipped we and 10 other passengers were told to go back to the gate. Given vouchers 800USD each Hyatt hotel and complimentary meals. The next morning staff helped us find the best flight. CDG-MIA-YUL. The 10 hours long CDG-MIA flight was on an outdated B767-300 but was really clean. Food was better than BA but still not as AF or Egyptair. No individual TV of course but good seat. I was able to sleep. The rest of the trip MIA-YUL was on an B737-800. Normal flight free beverages and everything else we needed to pay for. Great staff.

American Airlines,4.0,Krisztina Dobrocsi,25th February 2016,"Our outbound American Airlines flight to Indianapolis was fine, except for a rude flight attendant. Our way back was a disaster. Our flight from Indianapolis to Chicago was cancelled but this was told with zero kindness or empathy, but they told us we will go through Charlotte instead of Chicago to get back to Europe, all taken care of without asking the passenger at all. We refused and chose to drive to Chicago instead. The ground service at Indy was rude, nonchalant and not helpful at all, first they put us back on Economy class between ORD-LHR and afterwards they said there was overbooking on Business Class so there was no seat guaranteed. From Chicago everything was fine, we could not complain. The cherry on top of the cake was that the Charlotte to London flight they wanted us to take was also cancelled and never made it to London, so if we listened to the airline, we would have been stuck in the US for at least another day.

American Airlines,1.0,C Kidd,18th May 2015,I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late â€“ â€˜to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representativeâ€™ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic â€“ two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical â€˜issuesâ€™ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual â€˜packagesâ€™ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky â€“ even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was â€˜betterâ€™ â€“ in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped â€“ the 777 clearly had not been â€˜spring cleanedâ€™ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the â€˜entertainment systemâ€™ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is â€˜company policyâ€™ to only fly American carriers â€“ and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

The flights to and from Toronto to Ottawa were uneventful. The food served was a fruit plate. The flight to San Francisco was OK except for the fact that by the time that the FA got to be he said that he was all out of meat, fish, and chicken and the only thing he had left was pasta. I am on a low carb diet so I ate very little. In fact, he told me that I should eat salad. On the flight from Los Angeles, there were sufficient meals so that I had my choice. The FA here was very pleasant and accommodating. In general, Air Canada business class for North America is nothing special with seats that do not provide a lot more room than economy and the food is only the middle of the road.

Air New Zealand,3.0,Tony Maddern,13th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | To sum my family's experience up with Air New Zealand on our most recent trips with them - we felt like second class citizens. In my opinion, Air New Zealand's standards have really slipped since I flew with them in 2010. We flew Apia to Auckland, then Auckland to Sydney the next day. When I made our bookings 2 months before travelling, I only had a small selection of the worst seats on the aircraft (which I had to pay $40 each leg to choose) as the better seats were reserved for Air New Zealand's richer passengers to choose from. Air New Zealand have brought in a policy of penny pinching now and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of you. You now have to pay for luggage, for a meal and even censored in flight entertainment of any quality - with the crew only offering water to us occasionally, while people around me were served meals and drinks etc that they had pre-purchased. To me, this would be fine on a short flight (1-2 hours) on a budget carrier, but not on flights exceeding 4 hours. I opted to pay $10 for all movies in the end, but was pretty disappointed to find that the film I watched had been heavily censored and there were constant interruptions every time an announcement was made (usually about food, or welcoming platinum members etc) and including annoying messages popping up on the screen during films and games. The check in at Auckland the next day was a disaster. Unless you were a business / premium passenger, you are forced to spend ages trying to use their automated check in machines that are very complicated and frustrating, then have to use another even more complicated machine to drop bags off. In both cases, we needed help from 3 members of staff. The ground staff were helpful and the cabin crews, although not particularly warm, did their job. Air New Zealand have a fleet of modern aircraft and the 2 Boeing 777 aircraft that we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. At this stage, I will avoid Air New Zealand if travelling to or through New Zealand again. I'd rather go for a full service airline, not a budget airline.",Boeing 777-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,APW to SYD via AKL,July 2016,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Air New Zealand,3.0,Raphael Verdugo,25th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Sydney to Rarotonga. This was by far the worst flight experience with a Star Alliance Carrier so far, especially the cabin crew. We flew Premium Economy. Seats etc. were ok although outdated in regards to comfort which was probably because we flew with an older 777-200ER. However we never experienced such a bad crew: - Safety: they did not show much concern for safety or did everything in a rush. When they prepared the cabin for landing they were in such a rush that they did not even check if we had our seatbelts on. One of the crew members was more busy looking outside the door window to look at the islands. Service: very bad, slow and unfriendly. - Entertainment: best part of the flight, although the volume of announcements during the flight (even safety related) were so low you almost could not hear them which maybe was the reason why we missed a welcome announcement of some sort. - Crew did not care for the passengers or to keep the cabin tidy. Not once in a 5 hour flight they cleaned up the rubbish or asked if we would like to have more drinks. We had to hold on to our used coffee cups and cans even during the landing because they did not prepare the cabin for landing. Towards the end of the flight they served a small breakfast when the pilot informed them to prepare cabin for landing which put them out of concept and put everyone in a rush. This was by far the worst flight in a premium cabin we ever had. It was the first time we flew with this airline and after our return flight it will also be the last time. Compared to other Star Alliance members the difference, especially looking at the crew, is like day and night.

We were a group of five, my mother (a senior), me and my 2 children ( age 6 and 4) and my youngest sister. Unfortunately our seats were randomly assigned and not close to each other, so I decided to speak to the agents at the gate to help me sit at least with my kids together. I approached the guy at the gate in a very nice way and I asked him if he can help me with seats. I was shocked because of his unprofessional attitude! Instead of answering my request, he pointed at me with his fingers and asked to go ahead and board to the airplane! I repeated my question again and he started yelling at me. I boarded with my kids and family, me and my 6 years old had to sit by ourselves in different places, I asked the flight attendant if they had any open seats, she said yes, we have 20 open seats so I managed to sit at least with my son!

JetBlue Airways attracts it's customers with low prices for airfare as well as complimentary items such as their free 36 Direct TV channels on their in flight entertainment systems. However, while complimentary items and low airfare are nice, the customer service always needs to be a priority and that is what was lacking on Flight 602 service to Boston. Even though this was a Red-eye flight (aka an all-nighter), I believe that at the least flight attendants shouldn't be screaming for people to sit down. The attendants on this flight I can imagine probably don't like their shift but taking it out on the passengers isn't right. And while I understand that they have a tight schedule to keep they are perfectly capable of saying please and thank you every once in a while.

They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice.

Delta Air Lines,,David Kaiser,14th April 2015,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Olesya Musorina,3rd September 2015,"We had a flight on Turkish Airlines from Moscow to Manila via Istanbul. Because our flight to Istanbul was delayed, we missed my second flight to Manila. After some time spent in queues we discovered the next flight to Manila will be two days after and staff of Turkish Airlines gave us the option to go to Manila next day via Bangkok. They told us that we should wait in the airport till they book our tickets. So, we waited for 3 hours without any service and during this time the staff couldn't do it. Only when we found manager he told us that we can go to hotel service and get our tickets tomorrow, and by that time it will be booked. It seems that staff from Turkish Airlines who told us we should wait our tickets didn't know about such option. Next day we got our boarding passes to Bangkok, and staff told us that we should get our tickets from Bangkok to Manila on Turkish Airlines transfer desk in Bangkok. They didn't tell us anything about second flight - no time, no airline. We asked about this flight from Bangkok to Manila two times - the guy on registration desk and the girl on supervisor desk. We also asked about our luggage and they told us that it will be sent to Manila with us. When we arrived to Bangkok, we didn't find any transfer desk of Turkish Airlines). It took a long time to found someone from Turkish Airlines with help of airport service, and at that time it turned out that flight, booked by Turkish Airlines for us, passed some time ago. After long investigation with girl from Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines they booked us tickets to Manila for the second time. I should say the Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines were the only ones who really tried to help us. When we finally reached Manila we found out our luggage haven't arrived yet and be in airport next day.

Well, maybe no service would have been better than the treatment we had to endure during this flight. Apparently, if you order a vegetarian meal, and another one, and receive a confirmation that your orders are OK, you should not trust it. At least mistrust was the attitude of the stewardess during the flight. When we asked why didn't we receive our vegetarian meals, the stewardess gave us the clear feeling that she did not believe that we had made the request in the first place. No effort was made to check if such meals could be offered. The food that we did eat and the food that others receivd, was nothing to write home about as well. The flight attendant had very little patience for us passengers and had to reprimand one of us in a rather rude manner. The only entertainment during the flight was the change of scenery outside the windows.

My seat was tilted outwards and it was not possible to change seats because the plane was full. The flight staff was quite good, but not always attentive to passenger needs as in others airlines.

The food was better than any Air Canada Business Class meal I have had before. The staff were enthusiastic and attentive. The onboard entertainment selection was very weak, with a few new movies and even fewer classic movies. The music choice was appallingly short. I was not given noise cancelling headphones and was left with the awful headphones that AC gives out for free to economy class. The lie flat bed has very hard and I could not sleep.I expressly book business class so that I may get good sleep. The agent in Toronto did not mention to me that I needed to obtain my luggage in Munich and take it to my connecting flight. So, I had no luggage for the first two days of my trip.

However, when I boarded the plane, I was told by the guy sitting next to me that I was not supposed to be seated beside him as he told the air steward that he wanted my seat for him and his son. I sat down anyway, as I was not told of it. 5 mins later, the air steward told me to change my seats to accommodate the father and son, and I was moved all the way to the back of the plane. Best part, I have requested for special meals to be served, however, they did not update my special meal request even when they were the one who forced me to have my seats changed. So Turkish is hinting me that you can paid for 2 seats and request for 3? Mind you, it was the seats in the first few rows.

It's probably been about 20 years since I last flew Lufthansa and it is still as efficient and good as I remember. Prior to boarding, LH sends out a link where you can download magazines for your flight. Even though there was no in-flight entertainment such as movies, this was an innovative way of rectifying this issue. Business class in Europe, apart from Turkish, is generally done with economy seating and the middle one kept free. That is pretty much the standard. This A321 was the newer generation with the new sharklets (winglets) and looked brand new, the seats were good but no better than in Economy. The service was excellent. even though the flight was relatively short, just over an hour, we were served smoked salmon, some meat and a dessert which were all delicious.

Air Canada,1.0,Stewart Gordon,18th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | We flew Air Canada from Amsterdam AMS to Toronto YYZ having used British Airways to fly into Amsterdam. Initially we were concerned about the 1 hour 50 minutes connection time but this was not a problem as the Air Canada flight was delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes. Plenty of time for our baggage to make it from the incoming flight. Ground staff at AMS were useless, there were 5 of them behind the counter at the gate but only one appeared to be interested in serving passengers. Once on board, the aircraft itself was old and in serious need of TLC. The seat in front of me was split and the inner foam was bulging out. The in-flight entertainment was delivered on poor quality screens with an even poorer selection of out dated movies. The staff were pleasant enough and appeared to care about passenger needs. Upon arrival at Toronto, only 3 of our bags had made the trip with no explanation as to why one of them was still at AMS. We completed the form and were told that the bag would come on the next available flight on the following day. It didn't come, in fact it was finally reunited with us 9 days later and this was only after I had re-attended YYZ twice after being told that it was there when it wasn't.

On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music.

Emirates,1.0,Richard Chapman,24th September 2015,"I was excited to be flying Emirates A380 business class for the first time. Chauffeur service top notch. Seats well-designed, but the film choice was poor. The onboard service was appalling. The problem being that there are so many people in business class in the upper deck of the 380 that the logistics of meal and drinks service go up the creek. Added to which the stewards/stewardesses act like automatons with no common sense and often poor or no English. One example of cock-eyed service is that my wife and I were sitting next to each other but service came from different aisles so she might be waiting patiently for her soup while I am waiting (less patiently) for my pudding. And her wine steward wasnâ€™t permitted to fill up my glass and my aisle wine dispenser appeared 40 minutes later. Seemingly the only way to beat the system is to go to the bar at the back of the section but that would have requires all sorts of seat contortions. On a 7 hour evening flight you expect to get some decent sleep but there isn't enough sleep time when the airline's gambit is to stretch out drinks and dinner unendingly.

It took two hours to get the inflight entertainment system to restart but service was good otherwise and the same type of seat in the A380.

Received email flight cancelled and rebooked automatically 10.30am to 1.30pm - no phone call for other flight options?! Called representative to ask for earlier flight for both of us .. after 30 minutes was able to make the changes for both of us, I thought. Received an email next day saying I missed my flight and was considered ""a no show"". The phone representative booked the wrong date for 1 of our tickets! I called to complain to representative and they were unable to refund my ticket! I had to purchase a new ticket on my credit card. He referred me to another customer service line, waited 50 minutes on hold before being assisted. Then I was told they would ""try"" to refund me when it was clearly the employees fault! After arguing my case politely and being on additional holds, I was told I would be refunded within 30 days. So my credit card remains double charged for 30 days? 3 hours on the phone and 4 people later on the phone and still waiting for my refun.

United Airlines,2.0,S Rogers,13th April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | So not helpful and illogical. Showing up at the Aspen terminal for a flight to LAX, there were low clouds/ground fog that prevented the incoming aircraft from landing. Certainly not United's fault. Thus, this plane - intended to carry us to LAX - was diverted to the nearby, out-of-the-weather airport in Grand Junction. Those passengers were then bused up to ASE. Our complaint is that our flight group wasn't offered a ""return"" trip on that bus down to where the plane was residing (and wound up spending the night on the tarmac) at Grand Junction Reg Airport. No, we were all told - in spite of the inclement weather with promise of more to come - to ""come back early tomorrow morning",,,,,,,,,,,,

Turkish Airlines,1.0,M Lueneburg,12th January 2016,"When things go wrong (which often they do when it comes to international air travel) Turkish Airlines simply are not equipped to handle it, nor do they have any interest. Their company is built with a front end, but no back end. Incompetent and rude staff hangs up and walks away in the face of concerned customers. Turkish Airlines uses confusion, bouncing their customers from call center to call center and desk to desk, playing them in circles until they tire and give up. Most of their flights connect through Istanbul airport and it is pure chaos. A shiny building and western style stores and restaurants do not make up for under experienced, under trained and the lack of an idea of what the concept of customer service is. This is something I experienced on a flight from Chicago to Istanbul 7 days ago. In the 7 day time span my bag has been ""found"" 3 times, even informing me of its location at the Sofia airport. I had confirmation from a Turkish Airlines desk, and their Call center. When I traveled there to gather it, I was told it was never there. The lost luggage airport staff in Sofia informed me this happened with 80% of the people coming to the airport to gather luggage sent by Turkish Airlines. I have never seen anything like this.

American Airlines,1.0,Matt Crook,12th February 2016,"Washington to San JosÃ©. I made a mistake booking my AA Ticket online. Luckily the DOT requires airlines to allow you to make changes (with no fee) for up to 24 hours after booking a flight. I realized my mistake and called a mere 10 minutes after my original booking and informed the airline of the mistake and asked to change to the correct flight. The correct flight was the same price so it was a simple change. All went well and they agreed to change it no problems. (I thought) the correct flight was booked, and all was well. As I prepared for my trip, I realized my itinerary on aa.com was still the original flight. I call AA and they informed me that although they can see I called in, they have no record of the change. I explained that the reason I called (obviously) was to correct the itinerary, but they must not have done so. Despite the fact that they could see I called - they still wouldn't change my flight without the $200 change fee, since the operator apparently didn't annotate in the notes why I called, or change the flight correctly. Since all I have is a call log, and not a recording of the call, not sure how I would prove it. I'm not upset they made a mistake fixing my mistake (I made a mistake too after all) - what upsets me is that they are so insistent on charging that $200 change fee - even after I can show them that the itinerary should've been fixed when I called them the first time!

United Airlines,2.0,Peter Jensen,14th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Started with 1 hour and 45 min flight delay out to Santa Ana. The crew were unbelievably rude. Poor elderly folks trying to catch their connecting flights were trying to figure out what they should do and the advise is this, ""if it were me, I would get off the plane and find another day to fly"" or it was a short and impatient tone. The same crew responded to me in the same way when I asked if they could let the gate of the connecting flight know that I would be running almost a half a mile accross the airport to reach my connection. After running accross the airport and reaching my connecting gate, the guy manning the stand said I'm sorry they pulled the bridge back already, the plane had not even left yet. This was the last flight out for the night which led to me missing an event. The next day, the app made me walk a mile out of the way to the wrong terminal. I finally got on the plane and guess what, the plane happens to be the smallest plane available. To give you perspective, I am 6'7m, the height of the roof of the plane was about 5'8.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,4.0,Shkaruba Anton,25th February 2014,AMS-SVO-KJA-SVO-AMS. Economy Feb 15/23 2014 the only one-stop option on this route. AMS-SVO on Feb 15 was OK A321 clean and relatively new. The biggest problem here was the handling agent in Schiphol apparently Aeroflot took the cheapest option out of available and all the issues such as slow poorly trained staff and poor co- ordination with airport services - everything is delayed all the time and every time (I took over 10 Aeroflot flights from AMS during the last two years). No entertainment system. SVO-KJA on the same day was served by a brand new B777. A decent entertainment system but not much space in the economy cabin. KJA-SVO-AMS was served by A319 and 320 - everything described for the A321 on the AMS-SVO route applies here as well. Business-class check- in in KJA was a very strange procedure but in does not have to do with Aeroflot I guess (although my experience with their KJA agents was thoroughly unpleasant so probably they just do not care to check how those procedure work). Safety training of the crew seems to be a very big issue. They just could not care less. Their usual passengers are not very disciplined in general but the crew just does not act on this at all. Food was good on all the legs although the beverages were a bit below average though - juice and wines were really bad (alcohol only on international legs). Transfer in SVO from Terminal F international to terminal D domestic (and especially back) is still a big problem. Poor information little help from staff. When you are transferring from D to F you really shall look around carefully at each turn (there lots of them) - once you skip a little half-hidden pointer - you are running into a wrong spot and getting through security control (double!) all over again. No SkyPriority service in the Terminal F except business class check-in counters and a VERY poor tiny and shabby business lounge.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew.

Virgin America,2.0,J Taylor,30th November 2009,JFK-SFO one way. I flew jetBlue out to Boston drove up to Albany then down to JFK. As you can imagine I was tired. Takeoff was scary I could see the end of the runway while we were still rolling but otherwise pretty good. Plane not so clean found gum on my armrest. Cabin crew did nothing about it. Inflight entertainment good only it kept freezing. Seven bucks for internet access was steep so I decided to watch TV instead. It was OK only signal a little corrupt and couldn't see well. Also not a whole lot of channels. Don't be fooled by their low fares. Once you board you should be prepared to spend about fifty extra for a decent flight.,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Brandon A Stauffer,5th May 2014,My father and I had a reservation to fly from Boston to Sacramento. We had a connecting flight in Denver. Our flight leaving Boston was delayed 50 minutes our flight arrived in Denver at the exact time our connecting flight from Denver was leaving. United Airlines didn't hold the next plane just a few minutes and so 13 people on our plane missed the connecting flight. The next flight for Sacramento left the next morning so we went to customer service to have them reserve a hotel for us but they claimed that the error was not made by their airline and wouldn't pay for our hotel. Now we have to sit in an airport terminal all night. United Airlines is not a good airline and I won't be flying with them anymore.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no
United Airlines,1.0,M Riccio,5th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | This was the worst airplane experience I have ever encountered. My friend and I were going to Orlando and chose United Airlines because they were most convenient. On our way down to MCO we had a connecting flight in Newark, NJ. We boarded the plane as normal in Hartford and we were on it for 2 minutes before being told to get off because there was something wrong. We departed the plane and was out for another 2 minutes before telling us to reboard. We couldn't take off right away which made us late and when we finally did we knew we weren't going to catch the next flight. They told us to just go to customer service and get a new flight. When we reach Newark, we did just that. We got another flight pretty close to the other one. We boarded like normal, and five minutes in, they tell us they have to change the brakes. They said it would be a 30 min job. After that, they said they had to change a tire. That was supposed to be another 15mins. After that, they broke a piece and we weren't going anywhere. After that, they got a new piece and we were going. 20 mins after that we were finally in the air. We didn't land in Orlando until after 2pm, when we were supposed to be there at 11am. They offered us free alcoholic drinks because of the long wait. When my friend and I ordered she rudely asked for ID like we were lying or something and then made us split a drink instead of giving us one each. 4 days go by and it was time to go home. I received a text the morning of my flight (3am) saying that my flight will be delayed. This was the 3rd flight to be delayed. I had to go to Newark before Hartford as it was my connecting flight again. When we arrived at the airport and got to our terminal we asked about the delay and what to do about our connecting flight. The man at the desk said, ""I believe you will still make it, I can move your seats closer to the front to make sure you get off the plane in time."" We obviously believed him. It took us a while to get in the air and when we landed we rushed off and ran to our gate. It was closed. When I asked the man at the counter about it he said ""listen, I didn't work the flight."" I never asked if he did. I was then told to go to customer service. When I did so, the woman said she would put us on the 9:30pm flight to Hartford since that was the one leaving next. I was supposed to be in Hartford at 4pm. I didn't want to be in the airport for another 6 hours and get home by 10pm. I mentioned renting a car because Newark was 2 hours from my home and she said that United will not pay for it because they're offering me a 9:30pm flight as compensation. She then stated, and I quote, ""Well, you know what, you're here. At least you are here."" I was not only taken aback by the airlines ability to have broken planes every time I was supposed to board one, or the fact that they kept making me miss my flights, but I was unbelievably astounded at the constant rudeness, unhelpfulness, and overall attitude I received the entire time.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BDL to EWR,November 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,7.0,Farouk Mogheth,22nd November 2013,Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port!

Virgin America,8.0,Mike Palmer,17th February 2011,JFK to SFO. Booked main cabin select for extra leg room (+ one free case priority boarding priority check in and some free food / drink) - 6 hours before (in the middle of the night) we upgraded to first for $160 each. The money was well worth it due to the luxury of 2x2 seating for the first two rows only. However like a lot of flights you're at the mercy of your neighbours - in our case a mother and child who were loud. 1 hour delay announced at the gate at JFK where staff were indifferent beyond belief. They didn't really know what was going on and in the end we left over two hours late. There were some nice touches- lighting in the cabin music in the rest rooms pilot doing his briefing from the cabin. The flight attendants were very pleasant quite informal and helpful. The food in first wasn't really up to scratch. A salad main dessert. (and free drinks on request) followed by nothing - I'd expect a second snack at least. Although the seat was roomy there were no obvious instructions for the seat and it was trial and error to work out the best config to rest in. WiFi was NOT free and cost $11.95 for a laptop - good value with pretty good speed for 39000 feet. The negative comment really was on safety. A mediocre briefing poor checks of the cabin and lead flight attendant despite making the PA for all electronic items to be switched off continued to use his iphone!

American Airlines canceled my flight home from Boston without warning and there was no care or concern for the predicament I was placed in. Customer service kept passing me around only to tell me the same repeated message that there was nothing they could do to assist me.

Service good staff efficient but indifferent on the long-haul flights with food below par on occasion particularly breakfast. Dinner on both long-haul sectors meals edible. Drinks plentiful with frequent top-ups. Entertainment excellent with plenty of choice of movies and programming. Will definitely use again but a little bit more required to maintain 4-star rating.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Vic Kaushal,20th April 2015,AA flight 2891 on 19th Apr 2015. Flight was late 140 mins due to which I was sure to miss my next connection to Calgary. Technical faults do occur and are understandable. But the issue is how rude and uncooperative the staff were. They had a permanent no for an answer for everything in a most unprofessional way. As a last resort I was booked on same day from San Francisco to Calgary as it was very important for me to be there in Calgary. I had to rush and take ground transportation from Sacramento to San Francisco and working out the next step as I was moving ahead. Forget help no guidance was provided on how I can get to SF airport.

My family has stayed true to United ever since. No matter how much money we would save by flying with other airlines, we never do. It's for this reason that I take it so personally that United Airlines customer service has gotten so poor. 6 weeks ago I had to reschedule a flight due to a medical emergency. Rescheduling was no problem, and they handled the situation very quickly for me. I was supposed to receive a refund 10 days later. It never came. I've tried calling the past 2 days. Yesterday. Although I was on the line before closing time, as soon as closing time hit my call was dropped. Today, I waiting for 18 minutes just to have a rep ""transfer"" me to a dead line that said ""your call cannot be completed as dialed. Goodbye."" I'm now calling back a third time.

American Airlines,1.0,H Simpson,10th February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Where do I even begin with this airline? I could start by saying I will never be flying with them again. American has not once, but twice lost my infant car seat, stroller, and base when flying with a 5 month old baby. My most recent flight I had checked my stroller, car seat and base at my gate, when I arrived in Dallas for my layover it was nowhere to be found. When I asked for assistance it seemed that no one working for American had any idea what they were doing. One gentleman unloading baggage was trying his best to help us by calling his supervisor who took 30-40 minutes to even answer the phone. We got sent back and forth between employees who didn't feel like dealing with us and told us things like ""I honestly have no idea how to do this"". ""Baggage claim isn't answering my calls"" and things like ""You are going to have to go back to the gate you came from I don't have time to deal with this"". The most frustrating moment was when the supervisor finally showed up 40 minutes later, meanwhile I am holding my sick, hysterical child on my hip in the airport trying not to miss my next flight that leaves in 30 minutes. The supervisor drives past us in a baggage car, not even stopping saying ""you are going to have to call baggage claim and see where it is, I don't know what to tell you, it must be lost somewhere"". It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was then told to go to my next gate and wait there so I didn't miss my next flight. So I carried my child to the opposite end of the airport with no stroller and no extra hands to carry my personal items. When I arrived at my next gate and told the new American employee what was going on she responded by saying. ""Oh, you're going to have to go back to the gate you came from. That isn't in my department since you came from a different gate"". So extremely frustrating! I then proceeded to ask the employee how she expected me and my child to get home from the airport with no car seat or base when I arrive at my final destination. She then stated that I can file a claim with American and ""maybe"" they will supply me with a used one to get home from the airport. $250 later my husband had to meet me at the airport, 2 hours from our home with a brand new car seat and base we had to purchase so that we could safely leave the airport with our child. When we arrived at our final destination we were then told our baggage had never even left the first airport we left from. American Airlines stated if they could find our items they would send them to our address. Two days later an American airline employee shows up at our house at 1am with our items! One o clock in the morning! This is one of the most ridiculous and stressful experiences I have dealt with. American not only has terrible customer service but not one of their employees was knowledgeable or accommodating to our situation. This was a nightmare and totally unacceptable! I would advise anyone to steer clear of flying American Airlines. Thank goodness for family that was able to meet me at the airport with new items to get home, otherwise I may have been stuck at the airport with my child all night!

Turkish Airlines,6.0,T Merter,13th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Bodrum to Istanbul. While the ground staff at the Domestic IST CIP terminal are great in reserving front rows or exit seats for their premium Miles&Smiles members, unfortunately, the TGS ground staff in BJV are the opposite. When I asked politely if I could have a window seat towards the front of the cabin I was handed a boarding card with a seat in the last row with a grin. I then asked if I could do a last minute mileage upgrade. Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess. The flights to BJV and to IST were excellent in the air. On time, friendly and attentive cabin crew and detailed flight deck announcements.

At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good.

The attendant in the lounge told me we were lucky we had a plane. After boarding I was told the seat was not operational there was a barely visible sticker. But they did not know to what degree. The pilot had to look it up in his log. This took some 30 minutes. Verdict seat does not recline at all! They moved me to the back an arms reach from the coach bathroom. Each time someone went in and came out door slamming flash of light. There were 2 other much more desirable seats 4 AB it turned out those were for the staff. AA knows this are undesirable seats and it does not book them for their employees. The service on AA compared to other airlines is pitiful. With a few exceptions they treat you like they are doing you a favor. You never see a smile. The food most of the time is just plain bad. Due to the delay I almost missed my connection. After arriving to my final destination I found out that my luggage did not make it they found it 2 days later. Due to having to file paperwork for the missing luggage I missed my connection.

What I experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things I had read about them: first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided.

Luckily another passenger was commenting on how bad the gate agent was treating our daughter when an Attendant overheard and told the Captain he needs to make it right, which he did by ordering a non-rev off the plane and my daughter onboard. Continental Airlines never treated customers this was. They are truly missed. The flight crew was awesome by the way, but I have to give a low rating because of the Gate Agents and Manager.

Compared to other airlines on the route Lufthansa is downright boring but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat.

Bumped from first international flight with instructions sent by email to obtain update on the phone - only a local number was given (and I was on hold forever). Last flight leg ultimately canceled. Sitting in the airport - first it was 15 minutes late, then late due to medical emergency, then late due to engineering problems, finally cancelled. Foreseeing this as the process unfolded, I asked if I could be put on another flight (there was one, it was not full). I was told that Air New Zealand had ""a team"" working on it, then (snottily) that ""premium"" customers would come first. At the end, big scramble at the gate with no apparent rhyme or reason about who was rescheduled (I was not). They cannot field a plane, but staff are able to be rude. Other flights were also cancelled while I was waiting (engineering problems). Many angry people here at the airport today. I previously travelled on Air New Zealand more often for work, and I have to say, this domestic flight scheduling/delivery problem coupled with rude ground staff seems to be more frequent than the on-line statistics that I see suggest.

American Airlines,2.0,J Hunt,16th April 2016,"Salt Lake City to Knoxville via Chicago with American Airlines. Half way through boarding the first flight everyone was removed from the plane. It took the agent 25 minutes to tell the passengers any information as to what was going on. Mechanical problems. We sat for at least an hour before anything else was said. We were told to come to the counter and schedule another flight if we wanted. After standing in line for 45 min we were then handed a 1 800 number to call to reschedule. When I was near completed doing this they said the flight was canceled, we would have to go collect our luggage at the baggage claim, and go through the ticket counter to then get our new boarding passes. The 1800 agent had me scheduled, but it automatically canceled that one and scheduled me on another flight - 1 hour from then. I rushed to collect my bags and at the ticket counter the agent was not concerned about my troubles. The new schedule delayed my arrival by a day and I would have to stay in Chicago over night after arriving at 11 pm. When I asked she told me she didn't see where 'they' were giving any vouchers for food or overnight stay. Also, despite the long security line she wouldn't get me a 'prescreen' pass to get through security quicker. She said 'you have plenty of time.' Well, I did make it, with 3 minutes to spare. She was so right. I was routed through Dallas where I asked the agent there if I would be given a food and/or overnight voucher. She said I would have to check in Chicago, she couldn't help me. Upon arrival in Chicago the airport was almost empty except for a gate where they were about to load a plane. There were 4 agents standing at the counter talking (ie. doing nothing), so I asked one what I needed to do about staying in Chicago and is American Airlines going to give me a voucher. She said 'she was busy having to get ready to load a plane' and gave me another 1800 number to call or I could go down to the service center, which is a collection of phones, but no agents. I decided to consider it a complete loss. It was now almost midnight so I walked to the Airport Hilton, paid for a room, and left the next morning with yet another delay.

Once airside, boarding was not announced until 13:45 and flight departed at 15:00. There were many Emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. Clearly Bangkok's gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of A380 passengers and it was jam packed. No effort was made by the Emirates ground staff to separate passengers. Boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. Once on board, cabin crew was cold. The lady responsible for the area I sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent English when distributing the 'meal' (tasteless and cold curry chicken rice) and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley (Diet Coke for example), the request would fall on deaf ear. Despite such rudeness, service was slow and inefficient. They only served the meal one hour after take off and barely managed to collect the trays at top of descent. Inflight entertainment was good and a saving grace so that you do not have to speak with the crew.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to HKG,January 2017,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,no

They did not really interact with the passengers less smiles and seemed to lack manners. On the other side indeed there were the dedicated cabin crew who were willing to care and serve the passengers.

American Airlines,1.0,D Thomas,8th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Avoid American Airlines at all cost. They could not care less about their customers. I spent 17 hours at different airports all do to with American Airlines problems. Starting my flights in Salisbury, MD. Supposed to have a connection in Charlotte, then on to Fort Lauderdale. The first flight being overbooked. Thinking I was helping out the airline, I accepted a 300 dollar voucher and rebooked on a flight that should have gotten me into Fort Lauderdale earlier than my original flight. Now the fun starts, arriving at the first airport at 5am and finally getting to my destination 17 hours later. The first flight of the day was overbooked. The 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems causing me to miss my connection because of the delayed flight. Since I missed my connection American Airlines tried to find another flight for me, the next flight they offered was almost 10 hours hanging out in the Philadelphia airport before taking off. Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner. Also a friend had to rent a 2nd car, because I was the one with the car rental for the trip. Once I got home a few days later I contacted American Airlines and explained the situation, and to let them know I was not pleased. Of course I get a company generated form letter, not even mentioning my complaint, just stating policies. This company could care less about their customers and how they treat them.

It turned out the airport didn't have a gate ready for us and we were standing 45 minutes on landing field. Then my transfer become really tight and I literally had to run through the entire O'Hare.

Flight time of 12-13 hours is not bad for such a long haul across the pacific. Cabin crew are generally very good have struck few that seem pre occupied but overall they are very good. The lay flat beds are great. The fare seems to jump around a fair bit and can vary by up to $1000 for each one way leg. The 777-300 is well kept and tidy. The cabin lights at night are a pain they are yellow and bit too bright. I always get the centre row as it quieter. Food fine for business class. Snack bar available during the night. The inflight entertainment can be bit limited but generally enough to fill in the flight. Having done the trip a number times with different airlines in my opinion its one of the best airlines for the trip taking into account service equipment and ticket cost.

I asked him to document the conversation so I could follow up with customer service. He refused stating ""I can't document activities for interaction with customers"".

American Airlines,3.0,Derek Northcutt,27th November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service. This is not a problem in Europe where you are treated as a human being.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,,R Pacey,4th August 2013,We were booked 3 months in advance Johannesburg to Amsterdam. Arriving at the airport 3 hours ahead of takeoff we were told that the flight was overbooked and we were on standby. This was the first leg of a flight to Barcelona for an important business trip. There would have been serious losses to ourselves had we not been able to travel. No airline has ever done this to us before. Some pleading with the staff got us on to the flight but seated a couple of rows apart. I would never trust KLM with a flight booking ever again.

Emirates,5.0,Chia Ty,23rd June 2014,20/6/14 EK88 ZRH-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Pretty new aircraft of 1.3 years old. 85% Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. This time drinks came with salted biscuits 40m after take off. Dinner service 2h30m after take off and drinks came 30m later. This left many passengers parched and kept asking crew for drinks which they weren't very happy to oblige on this leg. There was no menu as well not sure if crew forgot or there was insufficient. Dinner was really good with choices between salmon with saffron risotto and grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes. I had the latter. Chicken breast a little dry but went well with the sauce. My mother had the salmon and the risotto was really delicious. Dessert of lemon torte was really good and I could have had multiple servings. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Staff service was terrible on this flight the worst flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Hardly any smiles during service which honestly does not matter call buttons by other passengers went unanswered. No drinks service after the meal service. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. I asked for 2 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and a rude male crew told me to get back to my seat and ask for it later. Not recommended this time. On a positive note a family of passengers who ordered Indian vegetarian meals didn't have their meals loaded and a female cabin crew were extremely helpful even going to business class to get a sandwich for them.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Lea Douglas,17th February 2016,"Barely professional and calmly arrogant. Both outbound and inbound flights with American Airlines were problematic to put it discretely. Outbound from Albuquerque (ABQ) to LA we waited on the tarmac for nearly an hour for what was explained as ""too much weight"". This enlarged into needing to correct the paperwork for this weight problem and finally into having to burn off fuel to eliminate the extra weight. Overall confusing and seeming disorganized in the first place. Our last leg through Phoenix to ABQ was a true mess. We came in on an overnight flight from Honolulu with a connecting flight leaving at app. 9am for Abq. However, we were held in Phoenix until 2pm due to ""mechanical problems"" with our assigned plane. This plane was still in Austin, (or so the gate staff said but the Customer service staff office nearby said it had departed earlier). As we sat and waited one could hear constant AA gate changes followed by a rush of passengers to elsewhere. The question steaming through our passenger group was simply, is there not another aircraft available when such a thing happens? Will we need to hustle to squeeze on to the next scheduled fight to Abq? Shall we rent a car and drive? The stressed gate staff kept announcing new and later departure times with no other info available. Then suddenly (our) plane arrived and after waiting briefly for a co pilot we left app. 5 hours late. The impression left was one of being in a gritty country called AA where chaos, lack of information and customer service is casually routine and where shareholders and yet greater profits are really the primary goal.

American Airlines,7.0,Jezrel Sabaduquia,11th July 2015,"First Class on A321 Transcon. Ground service was excellent. Flagship Check-In was fantastic, very spacious and modern space away from the crowd. After check-in, I was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre-Check Line and was done with security in two minutes, although I wish the agent was more jovial. Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast. Overall, a great space with much better food and drinks than the regular lounge. Flight was good. Seats were spacious with tons of storage. Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table. Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily. Overall, food could have been better although for a flagship route, American should step up their game, considering Delta offers excellent inflight meals on shorter flights.

My trip was cancelled, I was stranded at New York JFK at 3 in the morning, with no way to get home but spend $100 on an Uber back to my home in Jersey. I was inconvenienced, exhausted, and upset. I waited in the customer service line for two hours, only for their support team to tell me they could not refund me. I was finally refunded the next day after waiting on hold for an hour. It was not weather - it was that this airline could not handle the magnitude of flights booked for the Holiday Weekend and did not have enough Pilots.

Lufthansa,5.0,L Davids,20th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flight from Hong Kong to Luxembourg via Frankfurt. First leg with Airbus A380-800, upper deck business cabin. I've had the 'pleasure' of flying Lufthansa Airbus A380-800 in economy cabin and it was a horrible experience, unfortunately flying with business is a similar experience. One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning. At that point I would also suggest to avoid travelling through Frankfurt as this airport is a disgrace with rude and puzzled personnel and long waiting lines. The only bright point is the Lufthansa Welcome Lounge with extremely nice and helpful staff.

While on route to the airport Delta left a voicemail that our flight was delayed so we would miss our next flight home.

So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours.

United Airlines,1.0,Gersten Zvia,4th March 2015,2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would have co-oped with these extra hours had it not been for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots was tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. When we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flight attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Ahmad Aweidah,27th August 2015,Planes were new and seats where like any European business class (i.e. economy seating with an empty middle seat) with the exception of the Istanbul - Amsterdam leg where it was a proper business cabin. Service was good and the food very good as usual. The lounge in Istanbul was great and I believe is truly exceptional by any airline standard. Turkish Airlines are also very competitive in price since their business class ticket was only a few dollars more than KLM or EL AL in economy. Transit in Istanbul was surprisingly smooth but i would recommend at least a 4 hour layover. It is obvious that the airline has outgrown it home base a long time ago and the airport can barely keep up with the volume of traffic going through. All four flights were delayed by at least 45 minutes to one hour which seems to be a standard now for TK flights.,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tel Aviv to Amsterdam via IST,August 2015,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,Michael Critchley,31st October 2014,Since the late 80's I have been flying UA for business and pleasure and it has been a roller coaster ride. Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management. Once again we are riding the competition who are not perfect but much better than UA.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Nathan Gau,2nd April 2016,"My recent experience flying out of Oakland to Indianapolis via Phoenix has shown that American will stoop to incredible lows when trying to avoid FAA regulations regarding oversold flights. Our flight was oversold, and when they could not find enough people to take their vouchers, they announced a last minute delay. They didnâ€™t follow any procedures for said delay. Their gate agents knew nothing and the flight information wasnâ€™t updated until sometime after I had boarded. Once onboard, we were told the delay was due to a leaky coffee pot. Iâ€™m still at a loss as to what safety issues were at stake for this issue. The flight attendant wasnâ€™t much better simply stating, â€˜you wouldnâ€™t water on the floor would you?â€™ Clearly there is a disconnect here, because missing a connecting flight over a little or even potentially a lot of water on the floor isnâ€™t worth it, especially on a holiday weekend where my plans for the following day ended up completely ruined. Myself and probably a dozen other people missed our connecting flights. In my case, I arrived at my gate just as my plane was pushing off. My destination wasnâ€™t a hub, and the people managing this flight couldnâ€™t wait five more minutes to allow myself and the other two passengers who arrived at the same time I did, the courtesy to board. The next flight was four hours later (on a red-eye), and for my inconvenience, I got a meal voucher that would only be able to pay for a fast food dinner. Running through Phoenix, my laptop bag managed to open up causing my laptop to fall out. My experience with AA customer service wasnâ€™t much better. They donâ€™t get back right away, and they refused to escalate this. To this day, Iâ€™m still trying to figure out how a leaky coffee pot presents any real safety issue worthy of grounding a flight, and customer service didnâ€™t have a good reason for it either. I was offered a measly 10,000 bonus miles, worth nowhere near what the travel voucher I should have received for essentially being involuntarily bumped. That will get you (if youâ€™re lucky) one third of a domestic ticket, and not at all worth the inconvenience that was forced on me and fellow passengers. At best, this was someoneâ€™s incompetence. At worst, this was an unethical way for an airline to save a few thousand dollars. If it has really come to something like this to make a few extra dollars, then perhaps itâ€™s time for their customers to find an airline that respects them a bit more.",,Business,Economy Class,OAK to IND via PHX,March 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Amnon Freund,5th October 2015,"We flew Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt with a layover in Istanbul. First the service on the flight was terrible, I accidentally spilled hot coffee on my wife, the stewardess noticed it but couldnt care less (although it was burning hot, and my wife yelled), when I asked her for a napkin to clean the spilled coffee, she handed me 1 napkin without even asking if there is anything else she could do to help. That was only the beginning, due to late departure from Tel Aviv, we arrived late to Istnbul just to see our connecting flight push out of the gate (15 minutes earlier to take off time), we went to the Turkish Airlines desk, who told us we need to go to the transfer desk. When we got to the transfer desk, the clerk told us that we have been rebooked to a flight at 04:10, which meat that we had 9 hours wait. when I asked if they will give us a hotel room till the flight, we were informed that only if the delay is over 10 hours do they supply a hotel room. I asked to speak to a manager on duty to explain that the wait is 9 hours at night, we went to speak to a staff member but after letting us wait for 10 minutes he informed us that he is not a manager, and if we want to speak to one we need to go through immigration to the Turkish Airlines desk they will help us. We did so only to realize that there was nothing there. We needed to go back through immigration and went again to the desk to try to understand what we are expected to do in the 9 hours wait. The clerk informed us that we will be able to go to the Millennium lounge but only from 22:00 and until then we can get a complimentary meal from any restaurant in the terminal - which turned out to be false, only Burger king accepted the voucher for a lousy restricted basic meal. I can understand delays and re-booking, but I expect the airline will take responsibility for the delay and supply passengers a reasonable solution for their malfunction.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,TLV to FRA via IST,September 2015,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2.0,no

I booked through Travelup and thought I was on an Air Brussels flight and I discover it was United Airlines one. At check in I was impressed by all the help while taken aback to be asked the address I was staying. I unfortunately gave them an old address out of my address book which I then had to somehow correct, the staff reassured me with address labels. The staff on the plane seemed older. I started to be unimpressed when I found myself sitting in a seat that had a yellow sticker on its arm indicating that the inflight entertainment would not work from that seat. The staff alerted technical support who confirmed this so I and other passengers were given the opportunity to sit in any other spare seat. What unimpressed me was the staff could not get the inflight entertainment to work for any of us, we were given the option of buying into their wifi service (about $25) which out of principle I was not going to do, especially when the staff commented it was a bit intermittent anyway and there was no way of recharging my ipad as there is no USB port at the seat. I asked if they had any magazines, no. As compensation we were, at the end of the journey, alerted to their online 'appreciation' service. This I duly filled in, however their site did not allo me to put in my uk county for my address so i had to lie to make the page move forward and say IL for Illinois where I am staying.

Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future. Unfortunately Delta is not that type of provider, so if you are reading this review I suggest that maybe you shop elsewhere just in case (god forbid) a similar situation happens and you are stuck not able to get your money back.

United Airlines,1.0,Larsen Troy,6th April 2014,We were on the last leg of our trip at Denver Airport when out flight had been delayed 5 times. After the fifth time they changed out gate assignment and again the flight was delayed twice. After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids. The customer service lady gave us some vouchers for the food stores in the airport but the stores would not accept these vouchers. I will pay great amounts of money and drive hours to other airports to never use this airline again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no
American Airlines,1.0,Reshma Kadam,29th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Utterly disgusting experience. They are cheap and full of inconsiderate staff. They are not fit to be in the service industry as they lack compassion towards their customers. The supervisor at the airport did not allow me to get past the security line as my bag was 1 inch over the bag size allowed. He said ""I have to stand here all day if I have to deal with customers like you"". I had a basic economy ticket that allowed one bag under the seat and my bag fit perfectly under the seat as I have traveled on different other airlines with this bag placed under the seat. They made me pay for the bag and did not allow me to board. When called customer service for the refund of bag fee which I did not even check in, she was highly disrespectful to my request. American Airlines needs to train their employees about basic things like being polite, considerate and accommodating to customer needs and not forget that each customer has paid for the service.

The online reviews are fairly awful but I have had overall decent to good experiences. All flights have arrived on time and early on a few occasions.

United Airlines,2.0,Gail Winter,25th August 2015,"I was on flight UA1538 scheduled to depart EWR today 8/23/15 to West Palm Beach. My experience was nothing short of horrendous. I, along with many of the passengers on this flight, were appalled at the lack of customer service and communication regarding this flight. We boarded and deplaned twice over a 3 hour span due to mechanical problems, first waiting to see if there was another plane available or if the plane could be fixed, until it was declared that the flight was cancelled. Employee at the gate got said ""your flight is cancelled, go to customer service."" No other information was given, no concierge came to speak with us, we were on our own with no other information about where to go, the luggage, departing flight alternatives, procedures, overnight accomodations, nothing. I asked a baggage handler what happened to our luggage, he said it would come off at carousel 9. Carousel 9 was under construction and another baggage personel told us that the bags were going on another flight to West Palm ahead of us. They put a call in to get my luggage and said, go to carousel 8. After another hour and a half later, the bags were still not there. Over a 5 hour span, there was no customer service to address any issues. I finally tracked down my luggage and proceeded to customer service to get an alternative flight. I was told everything was booked until the following evening. My friends looked online and found a few sooner flights with JetBlue. I finally got another flight reservation at 11.30 tomorrow morning, a connecting flight that will now take me 5.5 hours to fly a 2.5 hour route. I am amazed at the miscommunication and complete lack of compensation or customer attention afforded by United. Their personnel had no idea of anything, we all got different answers to the same questions and felt completely abandoned by United.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Newark, NJ to West Palm Beach FL",August 2015,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,P Gealen,30th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Not a first time traveler, however this may have been one of my first times on American Airlines. It was the worst travel experience of my life. We get to national airport and wait for the flight. I look up and notice, there is a delay. No big deal Iâ€™ve had delays before. So we wait. Finally they are boarding. We get on the plane and taxi out to the runway. We stop, pilot announces we are delayed again because we can not get air to the engine. As we sit on the runway, there is no air being circulated through the vents. Itâ€™s hot and keeps getting hotter. The woman behind me tells the flight attendant we need air, you canâ€™t keep us on the plane like this. After an hour like this, people are sweating and feeling faint. Another woman asks if her and her infant child can get off as itâ€™s not safe for an infant. The flight attendants reply was â€œsorry, we are all hot. Youâ€™ll just have to deal till we get goingâ€. After 2 hours in the incredible heat they allow us to deplane. It was such a relief walking back to the air conditioned terminal. I wouldnâ€™t even leave my dog in the car like that for 2 hours but I suppose American Airlines doesnâ€™t care about leaving a whole plane in the smoldering heat. Shame on them! Another delay followed by another delay. Now Iâ€™m getting worried as I do need to be in Orlando by 8:00 that morning. I know our flight choices will be limited if they end up canceling this AA flight. I saw a flight leaving Dulles ( 20 min drive away ) 10:30 pm. I asked the gate agent should I head to Dulles or what is the likelihood this plane is leaving tonight? He said hold tight. I asked if I can get my luggage so I can have a chance at another flight. He literally said to me â€œif you were Nancy Pelosi or Oprah we could give you your bagsâ€. Hmm? So because Iâ€™m not a politician or a celebrity I donâ€™t matter? Nice AA customer service right there! So we wait. Like he said our flight did leave that evening. I think we took off around 11:00. I know we landed in Orlando by 1:30am. After getting rental car, and drive to our hotel we made it to bed by 3:00am only to be up again at 6:00am. I honestly wasnâ€™t going to write a review for this part but what comes next. I will never again fly American... We end up enjoying our stay in Orlando. We are set to fly out Monday April 29 3:00pm. Sunday night we are all packed up and checked in. Only to wake up to a text from American 7:00am stating our flights have been canceled. They can rebook us for a flight the following day. I canâ€™t miss another day at work, the kids have to get to school. What about the rental car and hotel? I have to pay extra for this too? Frustrated I dial AA customer service to be greeted by a machine and prompted to speak to a robot till I can finally get an agent on the line. The agent tells me we can book you Tuesday or nothing at all. She is apologetic, however canâ€™t do a thing to help me. She basically tells me thatâ€™s all I can do for you, have a nice day. I ask to speak with a supervisor. After a brief hold the supervisor gets on the line to tell me she can book a flight with another airline. Well at least now we are getting somewhere. She tries to book with Delta but during the booking she says the seats sold out. She says she can get me an AA flight landing in BWI which is an hour from my home, so will AA pay for that Uber ride? She says no, weâ€™ll have to figure that out on our own. Again, maybe if I was Nancy Pelosi or Oprah!",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Orlando,April 2019,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,1.0,no

Positives: decent meals plenty of choices in IFE baggage offloading was quick. Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness. Too many announcements and most of them were barely audible and sounded like mumblings. Overall not bad but I was expecting a bit more.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

The passenger sitting in the aisle seat next to me received her dinner but the flight attendant passed by me without leaving my dinner. She didn't even try to gently wake me up. When I woke up the flight attendant was two seats in front of me. I pressed the call button for someone to come see me and I also called out to the flight attendant, but she ignored me completely, unwilling to turn her head and look at me.

It was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. Although the kids meals were given as they had been pre-ordered I don't think they were particularly great quality. In terms of the cabin crew - rude, unfriendly and I could go on. We were issued the wrong menu - no apology. I asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if I'd asked for gold. The serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed - no system, no organisation. I wasn't offered food twice as they bypassed me. My partner was missed out on a few occasions too. No apology. They didn't bother with the kids, I went to change the baby and when I was returning to my seat I had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way.

United Airlines,1.0,E Ramesh,20th June 2014,I have flown this airline (on the way to Ukraine) twice in the past. This time I flew to Frankfurt Germany. Each time has been progressively worse. Every flight was delayed beginning with my flight out of Huntsville and on each connecting flight. One time they said it was some latch was broken or something to do with the luggage conveyor belt to load the suitcases into the airplane. Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it. The seats on the 747 were so jam packed together I always felt squashed into the neighboring passenger. Their computers were broken at the airport and so there was another half hour delay getting through customs was horrible enough on my return trip but dealing with United's mess was just reprehensible.,,,Premium Economy,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,no

They booked us on a flight from Atlanta to Boston and then to Richmond - they said we could go to the airport on Sunday (the day before the new flight) and said we could standby on each flight going to Richmond along with 150 other people and this meant running from each terminal and gate to be on the list. One time I might be 40 on the list, the next 15 and not get out.

Morning LAS-ORD flight delayed 60 minutes despite good weather across the country.

American Airlines,1.0,Fred Mertz,24th June 2016,"American uses dubious business practices when booking tickets. I booked tickets for a family of 4 weeks before the flight date. There were no available seats at the time except for the upgraded seats at premium prices. I checked daily for a month and no seats opened. I hoped to get seats when we got to the airport. When I checked in online 24 hours pre-flight, I checked seats again. Surprisingly there were 42 empty aisles and window seats now available. American wanted to sell out the middle seats first, then make you pay extra for an upgraded seat rather than make all the empty seats available. We got 2 aisle seats and 2 window seats in the same row. The plane was extremely small and the seats were closer together with less legroom than any of the other 7 carriers I've flown domestically this year - by a lot. When the seat in front of me reclined I had no room to read my iPad without propping it on the top of the seatback in front of me. This made for a very unpleasant flight. Further - all the cabin overhead lights were turned off for the entire flight. It was a red eye but there was no option to turn a light on if you wanted to. Whenever a passenger opened a window blind they were told by the flight crew to close it. This was supposedly to allow people to sleep (because nobody sleeps on day flights obviously) but in effect it minimized the work the cabin crew had to do since everyone was relegated to darkness and had little reason to ask for anything from them. The worst airline and the worst flight I've ever taken is an impressive one-two punch. Avoid American at all costs.

American Airlines,1.0,Christophe Vacher,24th October 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I had enough with American Airlines. It's now #2 on the list of worst airlines I ever used (#1 is Wamos, a Spanish airline). Their personnel on the ground (and in the air) is actually pretty helpful and their machines fairly simple to use, at least from my experience. But it's once you're onboard that you realize your mistake. I paid $1030 for a flight from LA to Reading and back, the same price I would pay for a trip to Europe, which is twice the distance. You'd think for that price you can get a minimum quality, even on economy. Wrong. For a start, you pay $30 for your first check-in luggage, and it grows exponentially! Totally outrageous. What this does, it makes everybody bringing carry-ons, overcharging the cabin with carry-on luggage, making it hard to find space above your seat for your luggage, so you have to put it in a totally different area (what a hassle to get it when you exit the plane!). No food for the whole flight (Yes, AA, I don't call food a couple of pretzels and a soda). If you want food, you have to pay for it. And what kind of food! Then, there is the entertainment: just as it seems to become a trend on the worst airlines, American Airlines forces you to use your own devices to be able to watch their programs. In their penny pinching minds, they automatically assume that everyone has a smart phone, or a tablet, or a computer. If you don't have any device on you, or your device is not compatible with their system (more on that later), you're out of luck. But the incredible part is, they don't even provide any electric plug or USB for you to plug in your devices! So, if all you have to watch movies onboard is your smartphone (which is already pitiful), and you need your phone battery fully charged for when you arrive at your final destination and need to call your friends, taxis, hotels, etc., again, you're out of luck. Now, let's talk about device compatibility with their onboard movie/TV system, which uses Flash Player. I did have a fully updated version of Flash Player on my computer, but their system kept saying it was not updated. After several attempts, since they were offering to download their own updated version of Flash Player, I decided to uninstall my version and replace it with theirs. Guess what? It still would not work. Their system would not recognize its own version of Flash Player on my machine! Unbelievable. I uninstalled and re-installed the app again, tried everything to get it to connect. Nothing worked. I spent the whole trip with no entertainment. Also, the cabin remained pitch black the whole time (you could barely see where you walked) which was very hard on your eyes when people constantly turned on their individual light or their computer screen. When we got to the luggage claim area at the airport, no indication anywhere of which carousel it was. When we finally found it, the previous plane had not even started their download, which made us wait for an extra hour. To top it off, I was carrying fragile items in a separate box. American Airlines made me pay an extra $200 (one way) because it was oversize. But the best part: they didn't put it with the oversize luggage (that are usually handled with a bit more care), they put it with the regular ones. Nothing was broken, but the whole experience really made me furious. The irony in all this is: AA is one of the only airline companies to wear the name: American. Aren't you ashamed, guys?

Their prices can't be beat for the quality you get. I personally like the seating setup, where you choose your seat based on a ""first come, first served"" basis regarding check in time. If you are traveling with young children, they do allow you to do family boarding after the small first round of people, so you can almost always find seats together. Seat room is a bit better than average, but nothing to write home about. Two free checked bags plus a carryon and personal item is unreal. Where Southwest really shines, however, is their customer service. They're funny, helpful, and always seem to be smiling. The flight attendants are especially good with kids. Overall, if you're used to high class flying, this may not be the airline for you as it lacks the preselected seating option and has only one class.

There are no more flights on any airline from Newark or La Guardia for 3 days. They refused to give a voucher for a rental car or a hotel. Instead gave us 20 dollars of food vouchers to use while we wait for a bus to be arranged. But no specific time or actual promise of this bus ever appearing. The food voucher is worthless as well because it's the middle of the night and nothing is open here.

United Airlines,1.0,S Burgquist,31st March 2014,I just returned from a flight from Chicago (ORD) to Tampa (TPA) for spring break. I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs.

American Airlines,1.0,S Simpson,28th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew from London Heathrow to Chicago Illinois this January 2017. I was pregnant and very tired from the previous flight. My seat was right in the middle of middle row. I was experiencing very bad nausea and vomiting at that time so I asked one of flight attendant to change my seat to the side so I wouldn't have to bother the person sitting next to me to get up over and over again. There were 3 seats empty behind us. I asked her if I could sit there, it was closest to the bathroom too. She said no, even though those are empty seats, you're not allowed to sit there. So pretty much they'd rather leave those empty than give it to a pregnant woman. Nice job American. She told me once everyone was seated, she would find me a side seat closest to the bathroom. I said ok. So I waited and she came back and told me there are two seats available and were closest to the bathroom. I moved there and there was 1 person sitting at the other end. Luckily, he moved with his friend and I got 3 seats to myself. Being tired and fatigued, I pretty much slept throughout the whole flight. I missed the dinner. When I woke up, one of the flight attendant noticed that I was one of the passengers who hadn't eaten, however she did not care to ask if I wanted anything. I got a glass of water and went to sleep again. When I woke up, I went to the bathroom and when I came back I asked the flight attendant if I could have a food tray, she gave me a very rude look and left. She came back after 15 minutes with the tray. I will not recommend or fly with American Airlines again. Our captain made an announcement that the in-flight entertainment system was out so we had no entertainment while flying from London to Chicago which was a 9 hour and 35 minute flight.

All seemed fine, until they tell you after payment that the Â£60 was only for the return flight! Fair enough, so I ask to add one on the way out, and surprisingly I can't because it's a FlyBE / AirFrance flight.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,David Bergstrom,11th March 2017,"â Unverified | Austin to New Orleans. I usually stick with full service carriers, but occasionally fly Southwest on routes where they provide a nonstop routing, such as this. Traveling one way to New Orleans for a sports competition my wife was participating in. Needed to check a couple of bags, using a Kiosk. All in all check in took no more than 5 minutes, despite a busy morning at AUS. Spent time in the United Club, then went to the gate about 45 minutes prior to boarding. We fly often enough with Southwest, so we are familiar with the boarding process, which to tell the truth, if I have to fly coach, I prefer. We always pay the earlybird check in fee, we are always in group A, even though it's not guaranteed, so we always get a good choice of seats. Sitting together, had a window and aisle, row 2, as the flight was not full this morning. Fast boarding, on time departure, quick taxi and we were off. Rainy morning this morning, so take off was bumpy and drink service delayed, but once above the clouds, we were served the usual complimentary drinks and light snacks. 58 minutes later on the ground in MSY, a quick taxi and an on time arrival. Bags were off quicker than American Airlines ever does, even when priority bags are attached. Over all a good value, quick trip, on time, nice crew, comfortable, clean plane.

American Airlines,1.0,Mark Elliott,2nd August 2014,I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies.

Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,L Barallat,2nd July 2016,"Travelled recently on Delta to Paris CDG, opting for the EWR flight as the time was more convenient than the earlier departure from JFK (I was using Delta Sky Miles for this segment). The Delta ""rotunda"" at EWR is actually a near-pleasant experience. For one, the departure time, just after 9pm, means its the last Delta departure out of EWR for the day and the entire security experience to gate was hassle free. The Amsterdam flight departs much earlier, at 6.30pm. The boarding area is standard Delta fare. There is a small Duty Free shop, some relatively tidy bathrooms, and one sports bar in the long corridor that leads to the gates. Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate. Flight push back was delayed 35-40 minutes due to a Sofia bound passenger that didn't board, and the luggage had to be removed from the hold. The plane was a 1991-build 767-300ER, which once flew for Gulf Air. Delta has done a nice job of renovating the interiors and even Economy Class was decent. AVOD was great as was the USB port to charge your phone. Meal service was nothing spectacular, but did the job for what is a 6 hour 30 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient, relatively friendly.

Southwest Airlines,1.0,D Barceso,20th January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Phoenix to Atlanta. This was the first time for me, luckily, to fly on one of the planes with the ""upgraded"" seats. Never again. In fact, I may never fly SWA again unless I absolutely have to. These new ""seats"" have pencil-thin ""arm rests"", without padding, meant to discourgage people from using them - and that design works: if you don't mind elbowing your neighbor, you'll get bruised from the ""arm rest"". The shoulder / arm area is thinner than normal, and unlike the older seat design, even very thin people, such as myself and the passenger on my one side, will be bashing elbows and rubbing legs when constantly shifting positions to try and get away from the constant pain of the seats. See, the seats have no padding. NONE. They seem to be made out of cardboard. There is not just no lumbar support or seat padding: it's shaped oddly the opposite that seating for humans dictates: the lumbar region of the seat goes back rather than forward toward your back, and the seat curves up at the part right under your upper-upper thigh (the seats are also the shortest depth of all seats). While you are hunching your shoulders forward to avoid being shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to bring your elbows in front of your chest and hold them there, while your lumbar region is being pushed into an outward curve by the back of the torture seat and your legs have circulation being cut off by the upward curve of the seat edge. After 30 years of flying only SWA for all domestic flights - 8+ in the past 8 months - I will not be flying with them again unless absolutely necessary. This flight was yesterday, and I am experiencing moderate neck, back, and leg pain as a direct result of SWA's torture seating.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Atlanta,January 2018,1.0,5.0,,,3.0,1.0,yes

The boarding process, even in ""Zone 2,"" was organized and efficient, again in contrast to the priority boarding / rugby scrum I usually encounter at AA gates in Miami.

London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong.

Air Canada,3.0,T Eldem,31st July 2014,AC 811 from IST to YYZ on B767-300. The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection.

United Airlines,8.0,Neil Ramsay,7th November 2015,"Check in at IAH was quick although we were overweight 1lb in one bag and were forced to transfer a jacket to the other underweight bag. I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs. The toilets were kept in reasonably good condition the whole flight. Seating in economy is tight and becomes a little hard after some time but you get what you pay for.

Water and or juice was offered quite frequently a courtesy bar area was available with drinks and snacks ie help yourself not that you needed it because staff were very attentive to requests. Food was ok with staff working well as a team when some options were short on supply. All flights were right on time. I flew on with them to and out and of Norwich.

United Airlines,1.0,G Meares,2nd February 2019,âœ… Trip Verified | I booked this ticket exactly a week ago. The app told me it was a 92% that the plane is on time. So of course I get to Houston just to find out the plane is late due to maintenance. I purposely chose this flight because it landed at 3 and i worked at 5. But now my flight does not arrive in TPA until 4. So now I do not have a ride and the Uber home is 45$. I have already paid 354.82$ with no carry on just so I could get out of the airport quickly. The ladies at the desk in Houston were so rude asking me why I am questioning them and they do not provide ground transportation. I contacted customer service only for her to tell me file the claim and they will get back to me in 7 days. After this I went to the customer service desk located in section C in the Houston airport. The gentleman there was the kindest and reassured me I would get reimbursed for something because itâ€™s a plane issue which means itâ€™s United fault but I cannot handle the situation until I get to Tampa. So now my options are a 45$ Uber or I have no way of getting home. As I walk the hallways I see signs saying United #1 in on time departures and then I get to the website and see there are so many complaints about flight delays and not because of weather.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,J Hutchinson,15th January 2014,Flew LHR-CUN (via ATL outbound and MSP return) in Business Elite. Pre-flight customer service (via Twitter) was excellent with the one or two queries we had. Check-in fast track security and lounge at LHR T4 very good - much better than BA at T5. Seats (flat beds) very good although foot area a little compact - we're 5'6 and 5'8 so taller travellers may be less happy. Pillow and duvet very comfortable. Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage. On board service excellent and friendly - on the outbound flight two crew (including the purser) came round with chocolates and thanked us for flying Delta they really sounded like they meant it.

While in route, nearly arriving at the airport, my boarding pass changed to a 7pm flight. I received no email, no phone call and no text. I called to have this corrected and the representative lied to me and told me that the 7am flight was cancelled so they moved me to the 7pm flight without any form of update. Upon checking with Delta, I found that the 7am flight was still on time to depart. I state again that I had already nearly arrived at the airport by the time I got the notice of the 12 hour change. I have never been so disappointed in my life, I was able to have it changed to a 12pm flight, however this should not have been the case.

Emirates,6.0,Franz Koepernik,3rd May 2014,Flight EK050/EK705 in Economy Flight EK706/EK051 in Business. Used special EK offer for business class. From MUC to DXB and back A380: comfortable seats with enough leg room even in Economy! DXB to SEZ a very different story: A340-500 with really cramped seating in Economy seats in Business on SEZ to DXB are not lie-flat and not comfortable. Food ok on 3 legs but worse (with old bread) in Business on SEZ-DXB leg. However can not understand the policy of EK to serve breakfast on a night flight at 3am on DXB-SEZ leg in Economy whereas the C-Cl and First Class Pax could sleep. Crew in general were polite but seemed very unorganised with bad service in Business Class on SEZ-DXB leg: they just served coffee and tea after breakfast with no refills and no additional drink rounds or offers. Personally addressed in C only on the DXB-MUC leg but also forgot after dinner to serve coffee or tea and the chocolate to me and my wife. In MUC they had troubles fixing the airbridge at the upper deck which resulted in late disembarking of all C and F-Class pax so at the passport control all Y-Pax (almost 300-400) were in front while the priority baggage was already on the bag carousel.

Air New Zealand,10.0,Mark Gibson,14th January 2014,MAN-LHR-LAX. Flew Christmas day from Manchester to LAX via Heathrow using Virgin's 'Little Red' service to Heathrow then onto LA using ANZ's premium economy 'spaceseat' product. Check in at Manchester terminal 3 was quick and painless our bags were checked in by Virgin and went through to LAX even though our main flight was with ANZ. After arriving at Heathrow and checking our gate number it was time to board. I find that ANZ excel in this area in PE. We were boarded as priority passengers right after business class. In their PE cabin its essentially just economy with extra legroom whereas I find ANZ really do differentiate with their premium customers. Onto the plane and as always its spotless I am always impressed at the friendliness of the cabin crew and the spaceseat itself. Yes this seat does not fully recline but this is not a business class cabin and more importantly is not a business class price! After a smooth take off and tasty dinner (both my partner and I opted for the lamb and it was very tasty) it was time for a few glasses of wine before they dimmed the cabin lights. I have seen comments that say drinks can take a while using the touch screen service. I usually just go and get my own drinks in this case the flight attendants are more than happy to let you pick anything you want. So a few glasses of wine later and a decent sleep and the cabin lights are slowly brought back up to full before breakfast is served. Finally we arrive into LAX 30 mins ahead of schedule. Once through immigration our bags are already waiting for us as they are labelled 'priority' and so are one of the first off the conveyor. If you are expecting a business class seat (i.e fully flat) then ANZ's 'space seat' isn't for you however neither is the price. I paid just over $1600 for my return ticket and at that price this flight was an absolute bargain. Compared to anything else that's out there the ANZ's premium economy cabin is head and shoulders above its competition both in terms of the product itself and the quality of its staff. Its just a shame they don't fly to more destinations as I believe the only thing keeping BA in business is their routes it certainly isn't their service based upon my last trip in PE with them. If you are taking the long flight from the UK to LAX and have a few extra dollars to spare then go for this flight it makes an unbearable experience (11 hours in a metal tube) actually pretty fun!,,,Premium Economy,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes

Air New Zealand,5.0,B Sparrow,8th November 2013,Having just returned to the US after visiting New Zealand. I wish to comment on the economy seating on B777-300 compared to the B777-200 AKL-LAX. The seats in the new B777-300 are ridiculously cramped both in width and pitch. I had the fortune to buy the emergency seats on both legs but would have struggled if I had been in normal economy on the B777-300. In addition the extra crammed in seat reduces the aisle width to uncomfortable levels for both sitter and walker. Perhaps you should be calling them Hobbit Seats for Hobbit sized people. Even your steward staff were complaining bitterly about the negative feedback they had received from cramped Kiwis. Did Air New Zealand get any focus groups to try these seat mockups for size or did Air New Zealand marketing people get done over by the people who sold the premium seats? Your superb airline staff cannot overcome the 12 hours of cramped misery that that I heard people complain about.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,no

Although advertised as allowing a carry on bag, there was an effort to get folks to check bags at the gate. Question, if it is allowed, why do they need to be checked - if the plane is small, allow free bag check before getting to the gate. Based upon the way the industry is geared, it seems that the best thing to do is always take the bag with you and allow it to be checked at the gate for no cost. In order to check a bag it required the removal of any medication, batteries, personal items, etc, the items one specifically packs into a carry on bag because they want to have it when they land. Also the cost for the seat (booked last minute) was extremely high (>1000) for a flight of approx. 2 hours. The service on the plane was good.

I paid for the man who came at the airport to do that instead of me, he passed the bags to the bus to Kumasi, I also paid for the taxi to the place I stayed near Kumasi. Etc. I had to buy items like clothes, shoes, cosmetics, drops, etc. I had to buy to use as I landed just in pair of jeans, trainers and jacket. I did not know when my luggage would be with me. I wrote a letter of complaint to KLM. Attached about 10 invoices for the items I had to buy. KLM replied me after one week. They decide to pay me only 100 EUR compensation. For delaying 4 bags! I had to organize by myself picking the bags up and delivery to different city and paid a lot for that. I did not agree with their decision. But they are not going to change their mind. Its very sad and unfair how they treated me in a very challenging situation. No empathy. No sense of responsibility. I learnt the lesson.

Flying United Airlines from Melbourne to Mexico through LAX, the flights were delayed for 6 hours. Had a similar experience on the way back and United lost our luggage! The customer service is rude and unhelpful. While waiting in the long line for customer service at LAX I overheard one of United's customer service agents joking about how she directed one customer to take the long way around the airport to intentionally cause him grief. My advice is to do anything you can to avoid flying with United Airlines. The small amount of money you may save with them is not worth the trauma.

I feel the need to leave a comment here in regards to the disorganization that Air Canada has in regards to baggage. I was delayed and missed our connecting flight home due to customs. I had asked every attendant or working persons that we had dealings with about whether I needed to get my luggage and everyone stressed due not worry about it. And like many would be, I was. I work hard for a living to have nice things, some of those of which I had brought on our trip. There is no system in place and the bag never made it back home.

Lufthansa,8.0,S Vukas,2nd November 2016,Flew Lufthansa from Lima to Frankfurt. Gate was a bit too small for the pax load and boarding was delayed by 20 mins. I reserved a seat with extra space and it was great value for money. Cabin was clean and FAs well presented. Take off was delayed for almost an hour due ATC. It's overnight flight so dinner was served promptly after take off and lights switched off soon after tables were cleared. I slept for about 7h and extra leg room helped the experience quite a lot. Manged to watch a movie at the beginning and another at the end of the flight. I like Lufthansa's IFE as it is not focused only on commercial entertainment with music section being my favorite.

The seats are very narrow and leg room is nonexistent, especially if the person in front of you decides to recline the seat. Furthermore, there is a box of equipment under the front seat, further reducing room for your feet, so you can't even stretch your legs as the comfort video tells you to. I know Emirates have a few configurations for the 777, it seems they put the condensed seats on the Asian routes, profiling the average body size of the passengers. Very disappointing for Emirates.

When I arrived at LAX, Virgin America had then lost my luggage. After waiting around I finally hurried a lost luggage report that took so long I was in jeopardy of missing my newly booked flight. I had to argue with the attendant as he would not accept the fact that my phone number was an overseas number. He was adamant that I needed to provide an American phone number(?), which of course I could not provide, as I live in Australia. We agreed on my email address. After arriving back in Australia I did receive an email saying that they had found my luggage and it was ready to be picked up.I replied that this was impossible and how was I to get the luggage and would it be couriered to my house.

Qatar Airways,9.0,A Hafiri,28th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Paris CDG to Doha. Qatar Airways is such a nice airline to fly with. From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner. The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest.

I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the ""Premium Access"" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus. I had a scheduled stop over of six hours but United decided to double it to 12 as the plane taking me to Wausau was delayed due to weather which I will say not entirely United's fault but some food and drink tokens would not of gone un-noticed.

United Airlines,1.0,A Welling,25th June 2014,"Flew from Hong Kong to San Fran and around the US in late May. I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a lowâ€™ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since.

The airport staff at Tokyo Haneda are from fellow Star Alliance partner and Japanese airline ANA, and they are exceptionally friendly. However onboard the plane, the staff are a bit more ""standard"" by North Anerican standards, but compared to US airlines, they are better. Food was edible to say the most, and nothing unusual. Typical Airplane food. The seat is a little thin in my opinion, and I am rather thin. IFE changed from the flight to Tokyo, which was good to see. Airport services in Toronto, however wasn't very enjoyable, but it wasn't Air Canada's fault completely as customs was sluggish. The second flight was delayed due to weather, but it seemed as if there were mechanical problems too. The flight was rather cold, but they gave us a lot of pretzels. Unfortunately, at Dulles, all of us couldn't find our baggage until they brought it out a good hour after our flight arrived at the gate, and it was midnight so it wasn't a busy time.

The policy has changed so much that it almost sounds like United doesn't want to retain cutomers anymore. On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins.

But I selected a Standard seat, my seat was changed by the airline. I had no choice but to pay an extra $89.00. Tried to check in online (return trip) no luck.

A tale of two contrasting legs: First leg Bangkok to Dubai fine on 777 or A380 depending on time of departure.

I flew business class and was upgraded to First just as I was walking on board the plane. It was a complete surprise but they really look after both their silver and the gold card members very well. BA does nothing of the sort. The plane was clean the food superb the staff lovely. It honestly is one of the best experiences in flying on earth and they have really got their product right.

Southwest Airlines,6.0,R Shaffer,17th April 2015,I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable.

I wanted to wait until the following week, and stick to my Mon-Fri schedule instead of arriving mid-week. They would not accommodate me this way. I could only reschedule within a limited time-frame. Any other flight at any other time would be full price. When I informed them about my insurance, I was told they don't actually have any, and I must contact the insurer directly, even though they haven't told me who that insurer is.

I realize that Virgin America is a low cost no frills carrier with a modern flair but the flight attendants on duty that day should take a lesson from the charming pilots heading the flight by at least cracking a smile and welcoming passengers on board rather than avoiding eye contact and appearing preoccupied with personal concerns. Moreover I was greatly disappointed by the lack of hot meals sold on board where small cold sandwiches and junk food consisting of crackers chips and cookies dominate the in flight menu.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,7.0,A Witham,17th September 2013,Zurich to Chicago with a layover in Amsterdam. My flights to Chicago were wonderful. They upgraded the plane to a 747 from a smaller aircraft and made announcements on board that after we were in the air they would move people around. I was moved from an aisle seat with 2 people next to me to an aisle seat with 2 empty seats next to me. I found the food service quite good and the flight attendants very friendly. While I would have liked a better selection of movies to watch the amount of TV shows I could choose from made up for it. However the flight home was a bit different. When I checked in at the airport I was given a middle seat although I had specifically booked aisle seats for my entire trip even paying to upgrade when I needed to. After a bit of hassle at the check in counter this was resolved by giving me an aisle seat in the exit row. The exit row seats are very narrow I had to wedge into it and if you were very large it would be very uncomfortable. At take off and landing the flight attendant who sat facing me took away everything on our laps including coats blankets and the boo I was reading. I understand putting bags away but really my coat and book? While the food and service seemed almost as good as the first flight for some reason they kept forgetting to give drinks to my row they would start at the row behind me.

I am a loyal AC flyer and in all of my travels over the years I have never experienced this level of attention and superior service. The ground crew was phenomenal and did their jobs with smiles and without a hint of frustration. On board, aside from the age of the aircraft and the worn-out interior, service, amenities, food and beverages were of high standards. I chose to sleep most of the flight and got a good 6-7 hours of shuteye. Flight left on time and arrived ahead of schedule.

I can only speak for the two of us but I found it very annoying and not relaxing at all.

When she got to her first connecting flight she was told that her flight was delayed which only allowed for 17 minutes to get her second connection which she will obviously miss. American Airlines was kind enough to make her wait all night in Chicago and fly her out at 7:15am, 10 hours later. This is the second time in a row this airline has done this. I will never fly with this company again. I don't care if I have to pay 500 dollars extra. If you buy a certain flight schedule they should have to honor your purchase.

We flew round trip to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe (Pointe a Pitre) via Charlotte and Miami inbound, and via San Juan and Miami outbound. We flew a mix of first and business class. We did not experience any delays or cancellations but the basic service you would expect in first class wasn't there. Leaving Seattle, we were able to access the Alaska Airlines lounge with our first class boarding pass, however when we got to Charlotte we were expecting to spend our 7 hrs layover in the lounge, but turns out, American Airlines does not allow lounge access to it's domestic first class passengers (even though we were flying to an international destination)! This was quite a shock to us, we fly Alaska all the time, and never have this issue. Service onboard was not what you would expect in first class, seats on most flights were pretty uncomfortable, the food was ok, except for the flight from Charlotte to Miami, where ""lunch"" was a bag of chips (on a 2hrs + flight), on this flight we notice the flight attendant serve herself a 3 course meal.

After travelling 30+ hours from Nepal on Qatar Airways with my two kids, I had a connecting flight on Jetblue to Tampa. What should have been a 3 hrs. fight, turned into a 5 days ordeal. We were on the Initial flight on the 22nd of July which left the gate and then after being in the tarmac for 3 hrs, they returned us back to the terminal because the delay caused one of the crew to be above legal flying time allowed. Our initial flight was eventually cancelled at around 2:00 AM the next day and they gave no compensation citing the cancellation was because of weather. I had to be in the line for more than an hour to book our flights for the next day. I was told we were booked for the next day flight, but when we reached the gate the next day, they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights. Same thing happened for a couple of days. Finally, after 4 days, they gave me an option to fly out to Sarasota. In between, they told me they had misplaced my luggage and was asked for me to find out where my luggage was. So, after 5 days, without any luggage, they put me in a flight to a different destination and to top it off, they put us in completely different areas of the aircraft and while I was trying to console my 7-year-old to go sit with a stranger, the flight attendant asks us to take our seat promptly. Please do not fly JetBlue, because they have zero passenger concern, they seriously need to fire the guy who manages the flights and reorganize. They were completely disorganized, desk and the person on the phone telling me I had confirmed flights, while the gate told me I didn't have any.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,6.0,M Dessart,2nd June 2013,BKK-AMS-BRU / MRS-AMS-BKK. Long haul leg from BKK to AMS was fine. Paid the extra for a bulk-head seat so no complaints regarding legroom there. Plane appeared to be an early generation 777-200 as the cabin was looking a bit dated and seats a bit worn. Plane was clean though. Food was decent though nothing to rave about. Arrived in AMS and checked the board for my transfer to BRU and all appeared in order. I get to the gate just in time to find out my connecting flight got cancelled because the plane had no crew. KLM offered to bus the passengers on the flight to BRU but I made my own way. KLM provided the usual voucher and an apology. Return flight from MRS to BKK via AMS was fine. On the AMS-BKK leg I was on the same 777-200 but bought the premium economy for this leg hoping to be able to get some sleep. Seat I selected lacked legroom because the seat in front of me had the equipment box underneath it so I had to sit at an angle to stretch my legs. With the exception of getting off the plane first there is little point in buying premium economy. IFE system was seriously dated. Small screen with visual static (it was visible on all the other screens I saw). Hopefully KLM upgrades these when the plane goes through its next D-check.

My husband and I were returning home from our wedding/ Honeymoon in St. Lucia on Flight AA4658 from Miami to Nashville and I was carrying my very expensive wedding dress on the plane. I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response.

The check-in at Sydney Airport was absolutely appalling, the whole experience took 40 minutes and after waiting 15 minutes in the priority line I was rudely told to go back to the automatic check-in machines, despite other passengers in the business check-in being served at the counter. The check-in machines didn't work properly (which is why I went straight to the counter), so a staff member had to be located to do it for me, then I had to drag the bags back to the check-in counter to stand in line again for another 15 minutes at least. I understand this is the process when flying in economy, but this fell so short of the mark for business it wasn't funny, and the different treatment for other (older) customers was insulting. When I did eventually manage to get to the lounge in Sydney, the barista service was nice, I was able to find a seat and the choice of food was good. However I preferred the vastly superior views at the old lounge (before they renovated about 3 years ago I think). The Business Premier seats on the 777s are comfortable and I find the bed excellent. The meal service overall was fine. I prefer to dine in the lounge instead and only eat lightly on the flight. I recommend taking the Peter Gordon dining options where offered, or having the cold appetizer or soup (which they always seem to have) as those are the most reliable. The breakfast smoothies are also consistently excellent. I had waffles for breakfast and that was also good. On the return flight from San Francisco to Auckland, I found the menu options a bit unappetizing. Usually I have the fast dine option, but it was a creamy cauliflower soup which is not what I wanted, so I ended up with three courses of a cold Gazpacho soup (good), chicken main (average) and lemon shortcake dessert (average). The hot breakfast options were eggs or pancakes which I didn't bother with, I just had the continental breakfast of a smoothie then fruit and yoghurt, all of which was fine. Having taken this route with Air NZ a few times both on the old 747s and the 777s, unfortunately it is noticeable how much noisier the 777s are. Even with noise cancelling headphones, the noise was annoying on the return flight and it reduced my sleep time. The 300s are marginally quieter than the 200s but compared to being at the front of a 747 or an A380s it is loud. If you are flying to LA the 787s would be great, but the San Francisco flights are on 777s. Air NZ use the Singapore Airlines lounge at SFO. I understand it's the best of an average bunch and the only one with airside showers apart from United First. Food options in the lounge were quite good. If you want to use the showers, make sure you get in quick as they had a total of four towels and couldn't be bothered to get any in until the next Singapore flight after the Air NZ one had left, very poor service. I had to buy a towel at the airport as a result. You also have to ask them to unlock the showers, what a pain. Singapore staff asked us to leave 5 minutes after boarding was called, and they shut the lounge to clean it for their flight.",Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Sydney to Los Angeles via Auckland,August 2017,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Stephanie Curl,4th April 2014,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke.

I held in the airport from 5am to 2pm. We got on a flight only to be sitting there for 20 min before taken off for maintenance issues on a plane that was supposedly sitting overnight. Why would you not have your mechanics looking at the plane prior to boarding time? The the flight was suppose to leave at 7:30 am only to be sent to another gate to board another flight only to be told 5 different boarding times and 2 hours later that that plane had mechanical issues as well. We were told it was due to maintenance and unable to fix. We did not board our flight until 1:30pm. How do you sell tickets without proper working planes? I also purchased an upgraded seat for the first flight, which I never sit in. What a waste! I had to miss 2 business meetings. Customer relations is refusing to set me up with their manager telling me they don't have one. American Airline you need to really do better. This is not the way you conduct business, especially when your dealing with my time and money. You really need to get yall act together and give your employees a proper training. The attitude that your staff have is so unprofessional. The sad apart American Airlines you do nothing to make sure your customers are feeling at ease after all the issues that you cause.

Emirates,5.0,James Johnson,6th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston. Am hoping the flight back home in two weeks are better.",Boeing 777 & A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to BKK via DXB,April 2016,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,no

It then took KLM 5 days to deliver the luggage to the place we were staying, two hours away. I called begging for my luggage every day and even offered to come to the airport, but they would not allow it. Our vacation was a long one lasting a full 3 weeks. I got back to Germany and sent paperwork to KLM for 200â‚¬ of reimbursement for the clothes and toiletries we needed to buy in the 5 days that the luggage was not delivered. KLM, responded saying that they did not receive the claim within 21 days of the luggage being lost, so they simply did not care and would not do anything for the horrible experience they put my family through.

From Doha to Manchester, luckily I was seated near the front and therefore had choice of food, and they provided numerous drinks run throughout the flight. I would give this airline 10 out of 10, but only going got give it 8 out of 10 due to not having my choice of food.

United Airlines,1.0,Jennifer Maguire,23rd November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Chicago to San Francisco. Literally the worst. Why do they offer cheaper flights if they go out of their way to punish you. They make strenuous concerted efforts to make your life difficult. There were 12 window and aisle seats available and I asked for one. ""No. With your kind of ticket you get what you get."" Made us low life ""discount"" ticket purchasers wait while 30 people on stand by got called up individually, got their ticket, and boarded in front of us with their aisle and window seats. Absolutely pointless. They really go out of their way.

United Airlines,7.0,Lee Matthew,7th February 2014,Flew from HKG-ORD and ORD to IAD. I had very low expectations on United. Surprisingly HKG-ORD ultra long haul flight has excellent service. Probably this is because the flight is staffed by Hong Kong-based crews. The 777-200ER aircraft has decent AVOD. Food is average but the crews offer multiple drink runs throughout the flight. ORD to IAD domestic flight is normal US standard. Only drink is served. PTV is useless unless you pay to watch Direct TV. Service by cabin crew very average. The experience is 4 star for the international flight and I would not hesitate to fly United if Hong Kong crews serve the flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,no

My new husband lost his passport 2 days before our wedding, 5 days before flying to Madagascar. After a  passport office appointment they said it would likely be done by Mon/Tues when we were meant to be flying Monday. On Monday we were home waiting for the post hoping the passport would arrive before our evening flight that we booked with lastminute.com (spoiler alert, it didn't.) First thing we rang lastminute.com  to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didn't arrive, after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring KLM . So we rang KLM and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldn't be a problem to change and they would email the details through, so we waited a while. Then rang KLM again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again, then they of course didnt. Then rang KLM again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com Long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and KLM and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction. Now we treated ourselves with an expensive holiday for our once in a lifetime honeymoon but we are by no means able to just throw money away, and as noone would help after 6 solid hours of ringing people, we drove to manchester airport to see if anyone on a desk there would help. Turns out as i stand there making a fool out of myself sobbing my eyes out at the KLM desk they won't help us either and told us to ring the KLM number. So I had to make a decision, as we were unable to see if our flights could be changed to another day for a reasonable cost and in a panic of not being able to afford new flights for both of us I checked in myself and left him behind to sort this mess, in the end he just had to buy completely new flights, which also meant he couldn't fly back with me. I appreciate this whole mess was caused by a stupid mistake of my husbands, but seriously how hard is it to talk to someone about a change of flight . And even if it isn't something you can help with, how hard is it to not lie and say you will help but then don't, or even how hard is it to treat people with a little empathy and kindness. Every single person i have had to deal with from KLM, from the phone, helpdesk, check in desk and flight attendants were rude and looked like the last thing they wanted to do was do their job properly. And on the way back our bags were lost and every person dealing with that was equally unhelpful and rude.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Antananarivo via Amsterdam,October 2017,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

I cannot imagine how taller people manage or bigger people for that matter as the seats are also very narrow. The seats barely reclined maybe and inch or so. This was a long flight 5.5 hours with no food offered. Drinks of just tea coffee water and some soft drinks offered only twice in the whole trip. Not sure what the attendants do in all this time. The reading lights for all the middle section of seats did not work. This was an international flight - US to Canada but I think Air Canada views it as one country.

Emirates,7.0,Ed Roggeveen,1st May 2015,I flew with my wife and 3 year old son from Auckland to Dubai via Brisbane and then a few days later onto London all on A380s. Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though.

My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy.

Not one incentive was offered because of this inconvenience. I have never traveled on an airline that doesn't provide travel incentives when there are changes of this magnitude. I will never travel on Air Canada again. Appalling service!,,Business,Economy Class,Nassau Bahamas to Toronto Canada,March 2017,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1.0,no
Delta Air Lines,10.0,D Sun,8th July 2014,Flew DL #231 from Amsterdam to Boston on July 6 and I have to say that it was a great flight. On time departure early arrival. Very tasty meal (Thai chicken) perfectly adequate amount of food. Nice snacks first an ice cream then a sandwich. I really appreciate the large bottle of water everyone gets after the meal service. Inflight service was very efficient though I think the flight attendants could have smiled a bit more. Seat size and pitch were comfortable and I'm not a small person. Inflight entertainment was outstanding - a huge choice of movies both new releases and older classics - that I really didn't want the flight to end. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased but I found this Economy Class experience to be very good.,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

American Airlines,1.0,Charles Jones,26th December 2017,âœ… Trip Verified | Jacksonville to Charlotte. Poor service both ways. Why use mobile ticket when one has to go back to counter after waiting cause there is issue with ticket? What is the purpose of pre check if line not open? Flight attendants subpar. Multiple flight delays on way to this destination with aa personnel ever changing excuses. Uninformed reps in airport telling clients the can stay in airport then being run off by security telling us we have to leave terminal. Supposed to be best airline of 2017 but definitely not.

Southwest Airlines,,David Demar,8th January 2014,"Flew from Detroit on Jan 4 2013 flight 2112 to Las Vegas with my 10 year old son who is autistic and has glaucoma. Flight was delayed 2 hours while we waited for a 3rd flight attendant. The gentleman taking tickets was making jokes and doing a comedy routine once we finally got on board his parting shot was ""sorry for the delay hope you had as much fun as we did"". When we landed the flight attendants got on the PA and said ""finally"" like the passengers were responsible for the delay. Missed our connection to Burbank that flight was delayed as well but they apparently could not wait another 20 minutes or so to get the rest of the passengers on. I told the agent I'm flexible and can fly into any airport in Southern California. She seemed to be put out at having to help any of us. Their solution was to basically throw their hands in the air and put us all on standby. The did offer lodging though. Thankfully I spoke with a different agent and she was able to get us to Orange County. Have never seen a more unprofessional airline.",,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,no

Lufthansa,9.0,Mark West,29th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Addis Ababa to Frankfurt. Lufthansa Duty Station Manager was visible and helpful at check-in. Addis airport is the usual smoke-filled chaos it has always been. Repeated security checks make your journey through this airport frustrating. Welcome on-board was friendly and helpful. Premium economy seating is directly behind the business class cabin on the A330 (3 rows) with only a small 30cm partition hanging from the ceiling between you and the row behind, which is regular economy. If this is a well thought out marketing tool - I applaud LH, however I would prefer an entirely separate cabin with separate toilets (these became very dirty and did not appear to be attended to by the cabin crew for hours at a time). Some passengers from the economy section tried their luck by moving to a Premium economy seat but were soon informed that there is an â€˜extra chargeâ€™ for that seat. They soon went back to their seats in economy. As this was a night flight with a stop in Jeddah we were offered a substantial snack just after take-off (at about 11:30pm local time) after which I settled in to sleep through the stop in JED if possible. The snack was a hot meal (I chose the vegetarian option) nicely presented on a small tray with chinaware and metal cutlery. A choice of wines was served in glasses and additionally, an amenity pack with all the basics you might need for the flight was provided (including those socks that no one ever, ever uses!). I have heard it said that the PE food service is identical to the economy offer. While I could not see what the passengers behind me were eating, the method of service is very different and you do feel that you are receiving an elevated standard of service. Prior to take off in Jeddah, welcome drinks were served (juice). I settled in for the night after that so missed the meal service and woke only for breakfast, which in itself tells you that the seat is comfortable enough to get a decent nightâ€™s sleep. The adjustable headrest with head support makes all the difference. If I am to offer a tip, take the first row of Premium economy if possible, on the aisle. These seats have extendable leg rests (not just the ones that are fitted to the seat in front of you) and so offer support to your entire leg/calves which makes for a more comfortable journey. LH PE is NOT a watered down C Class product. It IS economy. However, the enhancements are good and sufficient to make a â€˜sky-snobâ€™ like me feel that it was money well spent and (sorry Lufthansa) money well-saved from the full C class fare. I felt that I was a premium passenger but was left in no doubt that the C class product (which could occasionally be peeked at through the curtains) was entirely superior - as it should be.",A330,Business,Premium Economy,ADD to FRA,2016-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes

American Airlines,4.0,Matteo Tonelli,3rd January 2016,"My family and I flew from Milwaukee (MKE) to San Jose Del Cabo (SJD) with a connection in Phoenix (PHX). The Milwaukee flight was about 4 hours long and only a beverage service was done. The aircraft was an old US Airways plane and seat were not very comfortable. At Phoenix we had a short layover, about 1 hour 30 minutes and the flight was stopped during taxi because our gate was occupied. We got to the gate abut 30 minutes later and we basically sprinted towards our connection. The connection was done on an A321, still old interior, new livery. This flight was a little more comfortable but no beverages because of turbulence. The return flight was all on time and every thing about the same. I really hope American Airlines will improve its domestic service with free snacks on flights more the 3 hours long. Also same rule should apply to alcoholic beverages. They should improve seats, especially in economy, with IFE and make it free on longer domestic flights. My experience was not one I would love to do again, unless American improves. Hope they work hard and build something better.

Emirates,1.0,L Salter,12th March 2016,"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead.",A380,Family Leisure,Business Class,BNE to LHR via DXB,December 2015,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,R Cawlie,10th July 2018,âœ… Trip Verified | Miami to new York JFK. Boarded the plane and pulled away from gate only to find out twenty minutes in that we needed air pressure and a boost and we waited 3 hours with no air in 100 degree weather in Miami just for mechanics to come fix the problem that they said was no big deal. Then we had to wait about an extra hour for a push car to come push the plane and only the crew shows up without the starter car! Had to wait another half hour for them to find the car . And all this we were only told 2.5 hours in that we may leave the plane but the kicker is they were not giving back luggage and were putting whoever wanted to leave on standby to wait whenever they decide to give you another flight. They said it could be tonight tomorrow or next week. How convenient. Who is going to go anywhere without their luggage? Basically didnâ€™t make sense for anyone to leave so we had no choice. On top of all that the flight attendants were the laziest I ever met. I am 6 months pregnant with an 8 month old baby. We were both sweating and overheated. My baby couldnâ€™t even eat it was so hot for her and I asked one for water about an hour in and she pointed to her metal cabinet draws where the water is. Was I supposed to get it myself ? Who knows. I had to start crying to finally get water. Then they said that maybe they should start giving out some water. Maybe? Is that a joke. People are dehydrating. When my husband asked one for iced water she just stared at him with a blank face she only got it once he yelled and then she got mad he yelled ! They only started giving out water about two hours in and had to ration it because they ran out. People had connecting flights in JFK that they missed and you would think they gate manager would help them reschedule or provide them with a compensation but no. Our only compensation was a movie and 1 pack of cookies. I could go on and on. So unprofessional so lazy so incompetent.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,S Cooper,12th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | Flew Copenhagen to Amsterdam. Good if nothing bad happens. Overall KLM offers a good service and has a great flight network. However, as soon as something goes wrong, don't count on this airline. I have now experienced it for the second time that a flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions and KLM just did not manage to provide any support. There is a busy hotline and the fact that you may miss your original connection once bad weather hits is totally understandable. The way how KLM reacts to this, however, is incredibly bad. In both cases, the airline sent an e-mail telling us that they would contact us within the next three hours, but in fact, they never (not even after two days) write or call back. You cannot reach the hotline (you get disconnected after one hour of waiting) or their Whatsapp support. When I tried to re-book online (which they offer for free under these conditions and advice you to do in their cancellation e-mail), the online-system aborts the re-booking process and displays a random error message. What worked for me last time is to book a flight with another airline and ask for a ticket refund at KLM. In sum, the airline just dumped me and didn't manage to provide any support. I would therefore not recommend this airline if you fly via Schiphol (frequently strong winds and flight cancellations) or you need support after something goes wrong.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Amsterdam,December 2017,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,no

Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am. Other airlines can figure it out so please do to and spare us all the pain and frustration.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Qatar airlines is bringing back the glamour and romance of air travel. This flight was 10 hours and we loved every minute of it. You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crewâ€™s attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, thereâ€™s less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve.

Qatar Airways,3.0,P van Jaarsveldt,20th March 2015,AMD-DOH-LHR. The lounge in Ahmedabad is very funny. All the airlines use it but it is more of a cupboard behind a restaurant. The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail. I gave up after the 3rd attempt and went and sat in the bar with my wife which is quite pleasant.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,no

Emirates made trying to get a refund nearly impossible. No customer care and branded me a no show when I was in front of check in and attended by Terminal 3 manager who spoke to the check in clerk. Customer Services staff passed me from one person to another, eventually discovered that my ticket was blocked so couldn't get a refund until that was listed. No response from UK office, just not interested - and indeed if I had rebooked with Emirates I would have been charged an additional Â£200 but if you are taken ill and spend days in hospital Emirates charges you Â£213.

My business in LA concluded earlier than planned and I wanted to get back earlier, they refused to waive a change flight fee for me saying they cannot do it and they told me they do not permit standby either. I took pictures of the disgusting condition of the plane I flew back on - the seat back flaps were peeling away from the seats, it was desheviled and gross. None of the entertainment options or free snacks they boasted about in their in-flight magazine ever occurred.

Qatar Airways,5.0,Charles Kennedy,6th July 2014,LHR-DOH-NBO. First leg was in business disappointed to find Qatar are still using angled lie-flat seats in business class a curse I thought has lifted from all decent airlines. It is probably easier for a customer to learn to fly than it is to find a comfortable sleeping position in these things. Another gripe the entertainment system wasn't working at all. I was happy to read but another very basic omission from an airline that promises so much. Finally despite the potential of an a la carte menu which most airlines only offer in F class (if ever) the food was completely without any flavour at all. On the other hand the fish may have been bland but the cabin crew were the catch of the day not only kind and helpful but also intelligent and articulate. Transit at the new Doha airport was easy and the building itself is stylish and functional - can't wait to come back. Finally the flight to Nairobi in economy on an A320 was great three choices of food (my vegetarian curry was very tasty) and working IFE meant I could finally catch up on two movies I hadn't been able to enjoy on the first leg.

When we finally get to board we see these personal items of somebody's placed on two rows of seating. When my fiance and I go to sit down we are told those seats are being saved for someone else's family members. Obviously those family members did not get up to get a higher boarding number. When I asked the stewardess if that was allowed the stewardess replied we don't regulate the seating. Needless to say my fiance and I we're separated during a very long flight.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Stephanie Bradley,20th December 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I was taking what was to be a simple flight from Phildelphia to Chicago with a quick stopover in Detroit. When I landed in Detroit (before 8am), I saw that the flight had been delayed by an hour. This was not a bad thing, given that my original flight would have been boarding by the time I landed and I needed to get from an A gate to a B gate. That flight landed, deplaned, some crew arrived and got on board, and we are waiting, and waiting. They told us we were waiting for a First Officer, they had no idea where he was but hadn't shown up. So while we waited, the crew for our flight timed out. So, they send us a few gates down, where we waited for a flight that was coming in from Minneapolis. This was delayed, then delayed some more, then mechanical issues, then for two hours they told us the plane had pulled away from the gate, but hadn't taken off yet. From what I can tell, the plane never did, and I am not convinced there even was a plane coming. So, at around 3 something, they move us yet again from a B gate, back over to an A gate. Here, the gate agent told me there was a 5:40 flight, but that this flight was scheduled to take off at 5:25, so I should stick with that. All things were looking good (9 hours later) to get this 5:25 flight out. Plane lands on time, plane deboards, some crew get on board, and we are all eagerly anticipating geting on and getting home. Then they start delaying us in 10 minute incriments. Now, while it seemed like some sort of sick joke, the announcement comes across that once again they cannot find a pilot or the first officer. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The horrible realization was creeping up that time was of the essence and I likely was not going to get home that day for no good reason. There was one final flight out that night at 8:30. I went to customer service, where she was anything of customer friendly, but I finally got one of the last two seats available on that flight. She told me I had been switched to the 5:40 flight and missed it, which I had never been told happened and had been given a boarding pass and seat assignment for the flight I was standing waiting on. She accusingly said, ""Well here you go Stephanie, if that's even your name"" as she handed me my boarding pass for the 8:30 flight. Not the slightest bit of an apology as I had been stuck there at this point for 11 hours at nobodys fault but Delta. My time is more valuable then a box of snacks and sack of food from Wendys that were tried to buy me off or passify me. I eat organic, gluten free foods, so that wasn't helping my missed work or hunger. Of course no vouchers were offered, as Delta doesn't offer that, nor was any comfort provided in the Sky Club as I was told that was a different branch. All in all we took off a bit after 9pm after being stuck in Detroit for 13 hours. Some may try to say this was a case of winter weather. That is a lie. This was poor planning, negligence, poor service, and a cheap airline that has no consideration for it's customers well being. I travel 60% of the time for work and for the most part am the decision maker on my travel. For the last year and a half I have purposely stopped flying Delta because of too many flight delays, cancellations, and the worst customer service.",,Business,Economy Class,PHL to MDW via DTW,December 2016,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no
Emirates,6.0,D Graubard,18th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Larnaca to Malta. This is the only way to get to Malta from Cyprus and it isn't a bad option. Bought a coach ticket and a few days before EK sent an email for an upgrade to Business for Euro 320. One-way business fare is Euro 800 so I thought what the heck - I'll do it. You get neither the car service pick-up nor access to the business class lounge - it's stated when you buy the upgrade - but I think I wouldn't do it again as it's totally ridiculous not to give you lounge access. Check-in was friendly and flight boarded on-time. They use the 7-across business Boeing 777-300ER for this route which is false advertising as the upgrade email said lie-flat seats in private all aisle-access seating. But I had the seat next to me free and enjoyed the space. ICE is always the best of any airline so can't fault entertainment system. Service - the key point - was the downfall. The FA serving my side was lacking much personality, hard to get her to smile but I did manage it once. The male FA was mostly flirting with the lady passengers behind me and not until we lifted off did he come by and introduce himself. Food was average - had the same in coach on other airlines. Cabin was clean and again seat was comfortable for the 2 1/2 hour trip. Landed on time but priority bags came out last - which was a pain as I had a car waiting for over an hour after I landed. Overall it was fine but I would not pay for full Biz Class on any EK flight.

I must say the flight back was good and that will be posted in a different review but this one was appalling. We were in the first row and had a birds eye view of the flight attendant having what I will call a bad hair day. She put her long, stringy hair in bun, let it down and put it up again and so on a few times. That wasn't so bad but at least twice she ran her fingers through her hair and dropped dislodged hairs and goodness only know what else directly onto the cabin floor! I can't believe it but she did. I never saw her wash her hands and yes she served meals too. The breakfast was supposed to be eggs Benedict. Well there was no poached egg, it resembled a scrambled mishmash and the Hollandaise sauce was baked into the egg instead of being a sauce.

Out of the blue I got a text 3h before flight departure that my flight from LHR to EWR was canceled due to weather. The weather could not have been more picure perfect in London and same was the case in EWR. Upon probing the customer care, they admitted that it was mechanical failure. The reason they say weather is that then they are off the hook. They could only find flight to fly the following day. Now I went from direct flight to connection through Frankfurt. I had to spend one additional day in hotel, food, clothing all purchased at my cost. Unfortunately, my flight next day was also delayed. The guys in Lufthansa said that my connection in Frankfurt was fine. I missed the connection. Now I contacted United. They said it was not their issue anymore and I have to deal with Lufthansa. Lufthansa put me now through Denmark. Fine print: My flight from Denmark to EWR was standby and Lufthansa said that it was confirmed. We go to Copenhagen to find this hard truth. Called United and as expected they passed the buck to Lufthansa who passed the buck to SAS and who in turned passed it to United. With great difficulty my family and I made it back to USA, The SAS flight was horrible. Old plane, poor service, charge for even a soda. Horrible! I came back and filed a complaint with United. They make their feedback site so restrictive that you cannot explain details or upload bills properly. They dont even have a contact number to follow up. When I didnt hear back from United and called Mileageplus service, they basically said that wait your turn and we will call you when we get to it. What arrogance and callousness. Is this customer service? I have had it. I will make every effort not to fly United. But again, do we have a choice anymore.

Air Canada,2.0,Ian M Fraser,18th February 2015,Planned to travel with Air Canada (Toronto to Ixtapa) on January 31st for a one week vacation in Mexico (given the short duration time was of the essence). Arrived at Pearson in good time and was advised the flight would be delayed 15 minutes (acceptable but just!). On arrival at departure gate loading of plane was initiated then minutes later an announcement that the loaded passengers would have to be deplaned as there as a maintenance issue (not a weather or staffing concern!). First observation: why does Air Canada insist on placing faulty equipment in the loading gate? Don't think it is too much to ask to have a functional plane ready and available to load at prescribed time! Worse the 'delay' (over the next six hours) lead to a flight cancellation at about 7pm. Many families with small children are then expected to deal with the development one that was obviously known hours earlier but not shared. Air Canada's behaviour in this regard is consistent - it would be only a common courtesy to advise on such matters - honestly and in a timely fashion - so passengers can make other arrangements. But no the airline drags the waiting times out until no other options are available. As a result a plane-load of angry passengers are at the 'customer service' desk to make alternate (hotel and air travel) arrangements only to learn that the staff there have not been advised of the situation. As a result more time is lost (almost an hour) as harried staff scramble to address the issue making other arrangements etc. without being prepared in advance for the onslaught with answers ready and alternate course of action determined! Again incredibly poor planning from this passengers perspective. Finally we were advised that we were scheduled on a flight the next morning and this one actually took off as scheduled and on time. Remarkably as for this passenger it was the first Air Canada flight (out of the most recent five flights flown with the airline) that was neither 'cancelled' or 'delayed' on departure (I reference flights between March 2014 and January 2015 in this regard: Denver SFO Nashville Miami and Ixtapa (1)). As a result my 'trust' in Air Canada is at an all-time low as they simply cannot be relied upon to reliably meet their contractual obligations. Worse no one seems to care about the stress and inconvenience caused by their unreliability. Wherever possible I would strongly suggest finding other airlines to utilize if and when possible.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,2.0,no

I decided to cancel and refund my ticket at 2:30AM and just leave as I was going to Reykjavik for the weekend and it would have been a waste. Thankfully the Delta hotline accepted the refund and told I was to receive my money in one week (we'll see how that goes) and that I had to go to baggage service desk in JFK to claim my bag. I filed a baggage request form and was told that it will be delivered to my house in Manhattan by 3:30PM and that the baggage employees arrive at 5:40AM (I had to wait 2.5hrs at least). I had already been at the airport for 8 hours so did not want to wait. Well, now I regret it. Bag never left the plane and boarded the flight to Reykjavik. Not sure how that happened. On July 14, hotline employee told me that it will board the next flight (DL246 KEF-JFK on July 15). I said no problem and did not mind the wait, and I handled this all calmly even though almost all my belongings are in that bag as I am in NY for a few weeks only. I call again today (July 15) and the bag is still in Reykjavik and employee is not sure when it will come back to NY. Honestly I do not mind waiting but to be promised to receive the bag on a day and then for it not to happen not once, but twice, is very poor customer service. After 8 hours in the airport and cancelling my trip, not having my bag with me is the last thing I would want to happen.

Onboard I get to my â€œcomfortâ€ seat which is the aisle seat at the front right beside the washrooms. The aisle where everyone crosses in front of you. The man sitting beside me had also paid extra. His seat was ripped and the stuffing was coming out. He moved to the next seat over. Meanwhile people who had not paid the extra asked if they could sit in the other comfort seats (including the two by the window on each side which were much nicer and also vacant) and told that they could. We paid they did not they got better seats than we did. As we were taking off the air hostess told me to put my seat to the upright position I was surprised because I had not put it back. A few minutes later she told me the same thing. Thatâ€™s when I realized the back of my seat was broken. The man behind me was unhappy with this and spent the entire flight pushing on my back in an effort to keep my seat more upright. It would stay for a while and then a passenger would walk past and push on the back of my seat for stability and back it would go. The man would push me forward someone else would push me back - this went on for 9 hours. One of the bathrooms went out of order (the bathrooms beside my seat). The staff did not put an out of order sign on the door. They knew it was out of order because I told them. People kept lining up. I would tell them it was out of order. They would walk to the other bathroom on the aisle in front of me. I would pull my feet up to let them pass - one more strike against my â€œcomfortâ€ seat. The man next to me was trying to work - every time someone walked past they hit his computer. He was very tall and got tripped over and bumped through the entire flight. The other bathroom at the front of the plane was put out of order. They ran out of toilet paper. I chose to avoid drinking for 9 hours so I could avoid the bathrooms. The plane was so old and decrepit. I fly several times a year for both business and pleasure. This was easily the worse flight I have ever been on.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Qatar Airways,2.0,Chris Hall,29th March 2014,Melbourne to London via Doha. Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Daphne Yeh,15th September 2015,"Horrible service, will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I took a flight from Lyon to Taipei with a connecting flight in Istanbul. I was informed at check-in that my flight had been delayed 4 hours, upon further check at the airline's desk, I was informed that I had a choice to stay in Istanbul for 24 hours as there were no connecting flight due to the delay. The airline would provide lodging, transport to the hotel, and I only needed to apply for an evisa online. Up to this point the service had been slow but fine. This attitude had a 360 degree turn in Istanbul. As soon as I landed in Istanbul, a few passengers who would be staying at the provided hotel, myself included, tried to look for a way out of the airport and onto the shuttle bus. We were met with inefficient and unreasonable staff, my politeness was returned with unbelievably rude attitudes. We turned from counter to counter, with the staff giving us unhelpful directions. A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave. Still, I was lucky as I found out the next day, a few of the passengers had to stay at the airport (for more than 16 hours) because they had not been informed to apply for a visa in Lyon and after running around the airport once again trying to apply for a visa, was met with unhelpful staff and contradictory directions. Sadly, this was not the end of my nightmare. The insulting attitudes of the staff I had to bear when I asked for a certificate of delay at the airport before my flight was appalling. Again, I was turned from counter to counter (the staff seems not to have the ability to direct one to the right counter at first request) At my last stop I requested the certificate and explained my delay. Shockingly, the staff with scorn and disdain replied that my flight was not delayed, why or how did I believe it to be delayed? If it hadn't been delayed I would have been on my flight that second, not running madly around the airport struggling with airline staffsthat seems to despise and absurdly question the intellect of their customers. The breaking point came when he asked me why my flight had been delayed. No, the staff did not have the courtesy to tell me why my flight was delayed but had the audacity to put that question upon me. I have been very disappointed with Turkish Airlines on this horrendous trip. Through my encounters with the airline staff I felt insulted and laughed at. I question the credibility of an airline without efficiency, quality, and professionalism, to call itself one of the top airlines in the world.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LYS to TPE via IST,September 2015,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

I have flown economy Rome to Miami and back, clean aircraft, nice crew, edible (may be scarce) food, 3 services going west and dinner/breakfast going east. IFE not spectacular but many good films, orderly and relaaxed boarding both at MIA and FCO. Only shortfalls, seats a bit hard for the 10 plus hour flight and toilets not in top condition already at midflight.

Delta Air Lines,8.0,Avneel Abhishay,23rd October 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew from Los Angeles to Atlanta. I get to the Delta terminal at LA after a somewhat 11-hour flight, the self-check-in was easy and the staff were helpful, I dropped the baggage, the lady serving the counter was really helpful and the baggage drop itself was efficient. I went through TSA and into the terminal. The Delta terminal at LA would be an insult to 3rd world airports because there is absolutely nothing going on there. Unlike the competing American carrier's terminal where there is always music playing and all duty-free on one side, and all planes on the other so passengers can watch planes come and go, it kind of already made me hate the airline. The boarding was pretty efficient, and the cabin crew was the highlight of the experience. This was a red eye flight, and despite that the FA's kept making rounds of the cabin offering water, drinks, and snacks. In addition to that, they went out of their way to shuffle baggage in the cabin to make space without having to check them in. The flight on the plus side arrived 45 minutes early and I couldn't have been happier. The seat was really uncomfortable, and IFE was decent, but you have to press really hard to get it to respond.

The man at the boarding desk actually said to me that I had no right to request better seats (the plane was only half full) because we didn't pay for our tickets. I was appalled at the rudeness we experience and will not fly on an airline that pays employees to treat people like this. We usually go to the border cities to fly out of to save money.

The seats in the first class cabin are spaced so close that the tray tables cannot be put in place if the passenger in front of you has reclined his/her seat. This was true of any first class passenger faced with the situation. The flight attendant offered lamely that she wondered why this was a problem saying: ""That's strange."" Well, it's not strange, Delta has crowded more seats into first class than the seats are designed to permit. It was VERY difficult to get seated in so little foot room as there was.

We use Air New Zealand on two or three round trips pa because of its excellent Premium Economy offering. Better seating than other airlines PE on this route. Staff are good and lounges and shower facilities good where operated by Air NZ. Having to transit LA is not as good as it used to be via Hong Kong due to poor airport arrangements and US lack of good transit arrangements. The online booking system really lets Air New Zealand down badly. Try booking from Cork in Ireland and it consistently says no flights are available. Talk to the call centre and their system shows passengers departing Cork having to fly to London then to Vancouver or San Francisco with a connecting flight to join NZ1 in LA. This is despite the Air New Zealand flight (NZ1) leaving from the same terminal in Heathrow as the inbound flight from Cork to Heathrow arrives at! Try booking from London on the same date and NZ1 is available. I have written three times to Air New Zealand about this systems problem, including once to their CEO, and have received absolutely no response and the system problem still remains. Very poor service from an airline that otherwise is good. The result is that for our next flight we are using Singapore Airlines Business Class which was only Â£200 more than Air New Zealand Premium Economy.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Wahid Kouider,11th June 2018,"Not Verified | This flight was delayed by one hour or so, which made me miss subsequent flights Delta 0121 (MSP to HND) and China Eastern 0540 (HND to PVG). This delay caused me to change my subsequent flight to next day which caused a penalty of $1,187.90 that I had to pay to China Eastern. Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG. After calling 2 to 3 times a day, finally I received my luggage 4 days since my original flight.

American Airlines,1.0,T Carben,16th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Quito via Dallas. For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior. She actually rose her voice with us when we asked to speak to someone else and said she had the authority to make these decisions. There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times. We understand that flights can get cancelled but expect to be helped onto another flight in a timely manner or compensated for our losses. At the very least we should have an explanation of why our trip was cancelled.

Food catering is of the highest standard to match and surpass other European Carriers like BA KLM or Lufthansa. Airbus A330-300: IST-BKK. The TK business class lounge is very impressive with kids room multiple TV rooms 2 grand pianos and some of the cleanest toilets I have seen at an airport. Lounge provides user friendly lockers to store your belongings. A bit chaotic boarding at IST. The shuttle bus used to take passengers to the aircraft was a bit overcrowded and ground staff seemed a bit disorganised. However after boarding it's all up hill. FAs were very attentive and professional. The personalised chef for the forward cabin was a nice touch. Good selection of food and drinks and the inflight entertainment is more than adequate for the 9 hours and 40 mins. Seats are very comfortable for business class with an exceptional amount of leg room although the seat configuration of 2-2-2 does not provide loads of privacy for a single traveler with the two end seats A and K not giving direct aisle access. Overall Turkish Airlines provides a very good product in business. Will definitely recommend and travel again in the future.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,yes

Food acceptable but very small portions. No alcohol was served at all. Return flight without any boarding problems. Food much better than from Moscow but no choices were given at all. Young crew didn't smile even once quite poor English female FAs looked very nice and groomed but male FAs looked like some cheap bar workers - all ties untied buttons of shirts were left opened really bad view. Not impressed at all. Generally I wouldn't recommend Aeroflot for longhaul flights as service is quite poor crew inattentive and very cramped cabin but they offer the quickest connection from Western Europe and day flights which saves a lot of time.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,,4.0,no
Virgin America,10.0,Nadia Vasilyeva,15th January 2016,Thank you Virgin America agents for everything and for your amazing service. My mom and dad who don't speak English at all were in a terrible situation of possibility to miss their connecting flight to Moscow if not for the Virgin America agents who helped them to collect their luggage and guide them through terminals! SFO to9 LAX Virgin America flight was delayed due to some mechanical problems and arrived at LAX 3 hours later than it was supposed to be. So they arrived at LAX an hour before their international flight to Moscow! I thought I was gonna die having to deal with all of that. I called Virgin America customer service and a very nice gentlemen sent a message to the plane crew that 2 passengers were running late to their next flight and need assistance! There are no words to explain how grateful I am for your help! Virgin America have the best service!,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to LAX,January 2016,,,,,5.0,5.0,yes

American Airlines,2.0,N Meacher,20th October 2016,âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Boston. Was very unhappy with the way my luggage was handled. This was a full flight and they were asking passengers from groups 3 and 4 to check their bags. That overhead bins were full and all luggage of groups 3 and 4 must be checked. As group 2 I expected to be fine but had my luggage taken away from me at the gate. As I proceeded to board I saw that there was plenty of overhead space for my luggage which was now checked. My designated seat bin was completely empty and I am very unhappy with being forced to check my bag when there was still room for it. And I was not even in the group that was said to need to check their bags.,Boeing 737,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to BOS,October 2016,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no

Air Canada,5.0,F Atkin,4th March 2015,Last Sunday travelling as a legit full fare paying J class pax from LAX-YYZ-YWG. AC792 arrives late from LAX into YYZ but still there is an hour to connect to AC271 YYZ-YWG. Canada Customs press a magic button which allow my 2 checked bags to go directly to my connecting flight when I announce I am returning from a vacation in Hawaii. I proceed to my domestic gate to board AC271 and while in line am redirected by the gate agent to see her colleague at the gate desk. I am told I have been taken off the flight as my 2 checked bags won't make the flight? I am offered a Y class seat on the last flight of the night with a suggestion by the gate agent that the stars may align and I may get to ride in the cabin I paid for. Sent unceremoniously to the Maple Leaf lounge to await my fate I am granted access to the exclusive club even though I have now been stripped of my upper class status. Within an hour I am presented with a J class boarding pass for the last flight of the night to YWG. Was I bamboozled by my favourite mother country flag carrier giving away my original highly prized seat 1A on a Jungle jet back to Winnipeg on AC271? My 2 checked bags went through YYZ without me even seeing them and they were secured for travel from LAX-YYZ-YWG on company aircraft yet I was denied boarding AC271 based on the fact that my bags would not make the flight? Was I being punished for flying Delta from HNL-LAX in order to avoid flying Rouge? Or was my seat given away prematurely to a company commuter? Even when you pay full fare J class you have to role with the punches.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,3.0,yes

United Airlines,1.0,W Lewis,29th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Charleston to Newark. I have flown with United for 4 years consistently now and have never had such a horrible experience as today. Customer service was terrible, no help was given, and no solution so I am now flying Delta. I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful. The horrid stories of this airline disregarding customers needs or even attempting to be helpful have never been more evident than today and I am overjoyed with the care and kindness shown by Delta airlines. There is no doubt in my mind I will never fly United again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Newark,January 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Arriving to Beirut airport, none of my bags made it to the belt as we waited for our 5 bags. After constantly chasing United and MEA for our luggage we got 1 bag out of 5, 2 days after our arrival. A couple of days later we got another 3. It's been 10 days now and I am still missing 1 bag! Yet the biggest issue is the fact that United and MEA still cannot locate my bag! I don't understand how an established airline like United can make such a careless error!

United Airlines,1.0,Alexis Flowers,10th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | After arriving at the airport at 4:30am in San Diego we flew into Chicago. Little did we know we would not be leaving that airport for 36 hours. Our flight to our destination was scheduled to leave at 6pm. After our gate got changed 10 times and our flight got delayed further and further we scurried up and down stairs to each one. We then arrived at the last gate at 9:30pm. We sat and sat and were told no updates. We then were told we were waiting on the plane to arrive that we were flying out. The plane landed. BUT we only have one pilot, so we waited for another plane to land for a second pilot. Thenone of the flight attendants timed out on her shift and could no longer board our flight home. BUT by the time the other plane landed the staff timed out as we watched them walk right out of the gangway to the plane passed us never to be seen again. So, we waited on another plane for a whole new crew. We were assured for the first announcement over the intercom of the night that we were heading out soon! At this point it is 11:30pm. 30 minutes later, at 12am, we are notified that the flight is cancelled. after waiting 9 hours and running around the airport, it is canceled. This is not even the worst of it. We call United customer service to see what can be done 2 times (go ahead and listen to those calls- they are pathetic) only to be told there are no more flights to JAX and that we cannot be helped. The couple in front of us got another flight booked automatically that left 6am the next day why our customer service experience was so different is beyond me. We ended up buying the only flight we could in a different airport. We ended up purchasing a flight from MDW in Chicago to JAX. Sometime after purchasing the flight I was so relieved to find one! That is until I realized the flight I purchased from Delta airlines was on September 27th when I need to leave ORD right then and there on now what is September fourth. So with even more stress added, I am out over $500 more dollars, I still have no way home, I have nowhere to stay no way to travel, I donâ€™t have my luggage, I am defeated. So, after searching for some more time, there are no flights out of ORD to JAX for 2 more days. I ended up purchasing another flight for $935.60 from a different airline and airport in Chicago that did not leave until 1 pm the next day. We were left with no other choice but the sleep on the ground. So, it is now 1:30am. We are wondering where is my luggage that has everything I need in it and were told our luggage went to JAX already without us. It didnâ€™t make sense. So, we then stood in another line and were told that our luggage is at ORD but if we exit to get it, we cannot get back in until the morning. So, we agreed to get our luggage in the morning before we spend another $40+ dollars to transfer to MDW where our new flight is.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Jacksonville,September 2018,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Rudd,4th January 2016,"Our Turkish Airlines flight from Mombasa to Istanbul (via Addis Ababa) was delayed. On arrival into Istanbul we had to queue for 2 hours to collect our boarding pass for our connecting flight. This meant we missed our connecting flight to London Heathrow. When we finally arrived at the front of the desk the man was very unhelpful and arrogant. He said he could not help us and that we must go to the ticket sales desk to rebook our flight. The process of getting a boarding pass should not take more than 2 hours! We were told that the flight had gone without us and that we must purchase a visa and exit the airport to go to the ticket sales desk to get a new ticket. After a further hour we arrived at the ticket sales office. We then queued for a further 4 hours (where people were fainting, arguing and children were being sick) we finally reached the desk. We were told that there were no flights to anywhere in the UK for 2 more days. Our return destination was not possible so we had to change our return destination to Manchester. After this, we were told we could collect our luggage from the lost luggage area. After waiting a further hour, the staff told us it was impossible to get our bags and were unhelpful. As a result we still have no luggage. After this we had to join the hotel booking queue which took another hour. We have been left with no luggage, no clothes, no toothbrush, no toiletries and no warm clothes in a snowy environment. The customer service for Turkish Airlines at Istanbul airport has been the worst experience of our lives. The airline have been completely disorganised, unhelpful and at times very rude. The staff are unprepared and spoke minimal English. People should not have to wait in queues for hours without being provided water or seating. People with children were not assisted appropriately. We were treated like dogs for a problem that could have been sorted appropriately and efficiently. We hope that our flight tomorrow is on time. We have missed 2 days of work which we want compensation for. We also have a car parked at Heathrow airport (our original destination) which we will have to try and get as our destination was changed due to their incompetence. We will never fly with Turkish Airlines again. I cannot believe they have been voted the best airline in Europe. The way they have treated people is disgusting and an outrage. We hope they are ashamed of their service. We just hope our luggage turns up eventually",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy.

American Airlines,2.0,D Ruckel,17th March 2015,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions.

Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendantsâ€¦- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable.

It was ridiculous and uncalled for. It was nearly 6 hours in line before we were scheduled from Milan on United Airlines. I asked hours earlier if they could schedule us on another airline and was told no it must be a KLM flight. We were told we had seats on the Milan flight and when we got there we were on standby. The woman who helped us at United in Milan was kind and got us seats. In the 14 hours we were at Florence airport we were given one voucher for a sandwich. After we got our booking for Milan we had to find and pay our own way and find a hotel. Florence airport only allows one hour of free wifi which we had used early that morning so we had to pay for that too. It was 11:30pm by the time we got to our hotel in Milan and cost about 500 Euros.

Southwest Airlines,2.0,V Harrold,22nd August 2016,Nashville to Tampa with Southwest Airlines. My flight was cancelled with minimum notice. They had the entire full flight go to the 2 agents at the gate to rebook (they did not even tell people there was an option to go up front to check-in). Being A-List Preferred I called the number and they tried to put me in an open seat on the 1:55pm flight but they could not help because somehow SWA closed making reservation changes to them from flight 37. After the A List plus folks could not help I went to front check in but they had no ability to get me out until the 9:45pm flight. Despite my Business Select fare I got a boarding pass with position B5 on it. When I complained I paid the high fare and was A-List Preferred they said they could do nothing but I could try to better myself (13 hours later) at the gate. They also said if I called back Monday they would connect me with customer service. In addition to going out 13 hours later I had to wait 1 hour to get my bag back and leaving the airport paid $12 for parking that would have been included in my regular parking fee for 24 hours. On Monday I again called the A List Preferred number to be connected to the customer service to complain as I was told Sunday. They instead told me to send an e-mail. You have no idea how frustrating this has all been. Not only did I not get to meet the people I was to have lunch with Sunday I arrived at my hotel well after 1AM (flight landed at 12:20AM) to have to be at my office a 7AM meeting.

It was a full flight with many passengers having already flown for some 8 hours already internationally to Amsterdam. The baggage and food was loaded onto the flight, the KLM representatives were at the gate to board everyone, and then we were told the crew simply did not show up to fly the plane. Later the flight was cancelled - without any announcement or posting on the electronic boards, and hundreds of passengers had to stand about 7 hours in line to get rebooked!! People were exhausted. Many had other horror stories about past experiences with Delta that some said cancelled flights for no reason at all or because they can. Unprofessional and unreliable. Avoid if you can.

Both times missed out on our choices can easily get over that but the order in which cabin crew served people was a mess made no sense and took forever to complete. Half the time crew didn't know who had served who and on a few occasions drink orders were forgotten and on asking another crew member to follow up they continued to leave it to the original crew member who had long forgotten. The order of service was not front to back back to front or side to side it was completely random. The rest of row 2 had been served even though we frantically tried to get the crews attention. Paid full fare tickets. Felt completely left out and almost felt like the crew were prejudice against us even though they were lovely chatting to us.

Bottom line they kept me in a small airport from almost 9am until 9pm and then no flight. I've heard similar problems with this airline.

No flight attendants were seen after take-off and close to 2 hours later, the meal came. We were given a glass of wine and refills were not offered. An hour after the meal, we were finally offered a cocktail. This should have been done before the meal service. There was one other pass of the cocktail cart when they passed out a snack before landing. I paid $3,400 return for just a larger seat. No other perks were offered and the crew were not at all pleasant. I even complained to them afterwards and just got a note thanking me for my input.

I got to the gate and I was probably one of the last few to get on, which was a relief. I go on really short 5-day holidays and my schedule is pretty lean. Not making it to a flight will probably ruin my itinerary a whole lot. Anyway, when I got to the plane, it was quite hectic.

I was told that they couldn't get me on another flight until the next day. I was forced to find a hotel and pay for it on my own. My luggage had been sent on ahead and so I had no change of clothes and no toiletries. The next day I departed as scheduled. On my flight I was not served a meal which I had preordered and the television monitor did not work. It didn't matter because I was not provided with headphones and so I spent the entire 7-hour flight with nothing to do. I was not able to sleep because I was in an aisle seat and the flight attendants were going back and forth and kept bumping into me all night long. When I arrived at my final destination (36 hours late) my luggage had been lost and that took another 40 hours to deliver to me. I requested compensation from the airline several times and was denied. The bottom line is that they simply do not care about their customers.

We were 3 and a half hours before a drink was offered but we could clearly see the staff in the galley eating and drinking and have a good old laugh. They said nothing when a man walked up the aisle cleaning his teeth with toothpaste and a brush with disgusting bits flying over the other passengers.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,Shriram Gadekar,6th December 2013,I recently has 2 horrible experiences with this airline on my DC-Istanbul-Mumbai and Mumbai-Istanbul-Chicago flights. On my flight from Washington DC-Istanbul I received sub standard service from one of the air hostesses. Even after 4 requests I did not get any headsets. I was served dinner late and without any bread. The air hostess plainly ignored my request for coffee. While coming back from Mumbai-Istanbul I had booked row 29 seats but when I checked in I was given row 46 boarding passes that were not window seats. For window seats she offered me row 53 inflight row 53 was indeed the last row and I couldn't do anything. The food quality was not at all good and asking a preferred (Vegetarian or Special) meal doesn't make any difference. I will never fly Turkish again.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,no

We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right. Toilets were kept clean in the aft cabin all the way through free beverages and snack stocks were kept available constantly. Inflight entertainment runs (obviously) on some Android old op.sys tablets integrated into seat backs and mine was stuck somehow though but did not ask for assistance. Flights were punctual (no delays) and crew were smiling.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

Its comfort is at the limit of acceptance level, all they provide is a foldable tray which does not even have a glass holder. There is the latest in-flight entertainment system which comes actually with a very small screen. It hung 3 times while watching movies. One more time, it is relatively new but not comparable with modern systems. The service on board (if it can be called service) was the worst service I have had in the last 10 years. The crew were not polite, and didn't ask once anything like ""Can I offer you something to drink?"" instead they look at you without saying anything, until you say what you want. If you are not fast enough they are gone. IAH-GDL was on Embraer RJ145 I wonder how they can operate this route with such small airplane when GDL airport is able to handle bigger airplanes.

Upon getting to the transit zone (escorted by AirAsia staff), I was told that Emirates staff should be there and that they would assist me. It took 30 minutes for someone to show up.

Flight segment from Newark to SLC on a 737 offered the most cramped seating in memory. Legroom/seat pitch was the smallest I've experienced. When I asked the flight attendant if there was a better seat available, and if so what the upcharge might be, he offered to move me to a seat with a vacant center seat so that I could sit crossways with my legs under the middle seat. After an hour or so ""restless leg syndrome"" set in, a very unusual condition for me, and remained for the duration of the flight. I spent the last hour plus standing up. I should add that there were legroom seats available, but not offered. I strongly resent being required to pay $100 plus for such an upgrade, even if it had been offered.

I liked that the flight attendants didn't walk up down the aisle with carts - it allows them to get through so much faster and doesn't trap people in the aisle when they're trying to go to the restroom.

The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like.

The seating in economy was 10 abreast in the configuration 3-4-3. It was the worst flight I have experienced and I am a seasoned traveller. They have clearly added extra seats on these planes. I suspect the new Premium Economy cabin this plane has was added at the expense of space in Economy. It is unforgivable to subject economy class passengers to these new cramped conditions. Whilst people are getting bigger Air Canada sees fit to make the space provided smaller. On top of that the crew on my flight did and others have made the comment the bare minimum required and all without a smile! To treat passengers as if they are an inconvenience to their day is astonishing? The way the food is disgusting! A dollop of salad stale brownie and a dish of sludge which was masquerading as vegetarian Shepherds Pie! I also fly often to Toronto in planes with 2-5-2 configuration and that is more comfortable sadly the FAs and the good are still rubbish.

I had the window seat in the first overwing exit row, and the middle seat was empty, so the seating was quite comfortable. There were, however, two areas where United fell short. Warm breakfast meals are supposedly available for purchase, but by the 8th row of premium economy, all options were sold out. This was an early morning flight and the catering crew should have anticipated a higher demand for meals. My second observation concerns the in-flight entertainment. I have the United app downloaded on my iPad, so I was able to access a variety of movies free of charge. There is also a very inferior flight map with some aircraft data.

Emirates,2.0,Anitha Menon,21st December 2015,"My husband and I flew Emirates from Lusaka to Dubai, on the way to China during mid September. We are Platinum and Gold card holders respectively, and frequent fliers of Emirates on the Lusaka-Dubai route on Business class. We were upgraded from Business Class to First Class for this specific flight, and were appalled at the quality of the A340 Premium products. For all the wonderful advertisements (and personal experiences) on premium products on the A380s and B777s, the product on the LUN-DXB sector is something that definitely needs to change. Business Class seats themselves are not fully flat beds, only the old cradle seats, hence was pleased to be upgraded to First Class, but we weren't aware of what was coming. We got First Class seats where the recline and leg rests were not working. Hence was made to stand and wait 20 minutes in the aisle while the flight attendants tried to manually recline our seats. Although this was done, the leg rest was not able to be manually reclined, hence was given boxes, yes boxes and pillows in order to rest our legs. For one of the so called best airlines in the world, that is completely unacceptable. This is something that no one should experience on First class, especially if someone pays the very high fares Emirates offers.

Aeromexico,1.0,Joshua Kors,11th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Mexico City to New York JFK. I was shocked by the horrible, unprofessional, incompetent way that I was treated by Aeromexico during my recent flight. Their deception, misinformation and incompetence cost me 8,612 extra pesos! I should not have been treated this way. I arrived at the Mexico City airport in the early morning, hours before my flight. I checked in at Aeromexico's check-in desk. The clerk checked my printed ticket and my U.S. passport and confirmed them. I asked if there was anything else, and she said no, that I was good to go. She checked in my suitcase and gave me the receipt for my checked-in bag. Then I went to my gate and waited several hours until boarding. When boarding began, I stood in line and eventually reached the front of the line, expecting to be checked in and board the plane. The Aeromexico employee at the gate asked me for the stub from my Mexican immigration papers, which I signed upon entering the country. The Aeromexico clerk at the baggage check-in had said nothing about this stub when I asked if there was ""anything else"" I needed. When she indicated that there wasn't, I placed the stub into my suitcase, which she then checked in. The clerk at the gate told me not to worry, that all I'd need to do is go to the Immigration desk and sign another immigration stub. She told me to sign it, then come back to the gate â€” that I could then board at the gate with no problem. That turned out to be a lie â€” or at least, radical misinformation. At her direction, I ran to the Immigration desk, signed a second immigration stub, and paid a 500 peso penalty, then sprinted back to the gate, returning just minutes after I had left. Suddenly the clerk at the gate had completely changed her tune. ""Sorry,"" she said, ""plane's leaving. You can't board."" I reminded her that she told me to go get the second immigration stub, return to the gate, and that I'd have no problem boarding the plane. The clerk brushed off my concern like it was of no importance and returned to chatting with a fellow employee. Upset, I went to the Aeromexico customer service desk. The clerk there told me not to worry, that this was no problem at all. ""There's a 9:05 am.flight to JFK,"" she said. ""Just go to the Aeromexico desk at L2 or L3, ask for the manager and have her switch you to that flight. It will be no charge."" But this turned out to be a lie too. I should have known something was up because the clerk refused to tell me her name. When I sighed, she told me again: Just go to L2 or L3, talk to the manager, and get the free reassignment. ""It's just a little bit of paperwork,"" she said. So I went to L2 and waited in line for 45 minutes to see the manager. When I got to the front desk, the clerk there said that if I wanted to get on the next flight, there would be a penalty - a 8,112 pesos. That's $453.65. ""It's Aeromexico procedure,"" they said. In the end, I spoke with 8 Aeromexico employees, but none helped, including the customer service help line. They told me they had no power to process customer service matters.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to New York JFK,August 2017,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Malcolm Gibson,3rd January 2016,"Partial review on behalf of my daughter and friend. They bought an American Airlines ticket from London Heathrow to St Thomas via Miami. They should have had two hours from touchdown in Miami to catch the connection to St Thomas. The flight from Heathrow arrived 50 minutes late. None of the American Airlines staff made any attempt to assist these two girls in making the connection. They sold them the ticket, so they must have known that they had a connecting flight, yet every enquiry they made they were told to wait. They missed the connection and eventually someone at AA did at least organise them a hotel. As I type 08.20 (US eastern) on the 3rd, they are in the departure lounge in Miami hoping for a cancellation on the midday flight to St Thomas. If they miss this, then they will not make their dream holiday, flotilla sailing holiday around the British Virgin Islands. The handling of this matter by American Airlines staff has so far been dreadful. Let's hope they pull out the stops to put right the problems caused by the late arrival of their aircraft and subsequent poor handling of customers needing to make connecting flights by their airport based staff",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to STT via MIA,January 2016,,,,,1.0,1.0,no

Later on asked another member of ground crew about the update on my flight he was careless to even answer me properly. Onboard 2 female crew were shouting at passengers.

They did this for the other two delays that were undoubtedly deltaâ€™s doing and had nothing to do with weather. Each leg involved hours upon hours of trying to find a delta phone operator who felt like rebooking my flight. When I finally made it to my destination, I was informed that delta had sent my bags (which would have come in handy for my two-week vacation) the opposite direction all the way back to Detroit.

Southwest Airlines,7.0,E Bolton,19th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Sacramento to San Antonio via San Diego. My flights with Southwest Airlines were fine. On the return flight - the copilot actually came down the aisle and introduced himself and wished everyone a good flight - nice touch. My issue came with the connecting gates in San Diego - Gates 1, 1A and 2. The first flight from Sacramento to San Diego - I had to change gates. Much to my surprise, I had to go through TSA security again because you walked from a secure area to a non-secure area. Even though I purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate - I had to toss it because of the 2nd TSA security screen. On the way back - I had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight. Unfortunately, I had to change gates in San Diego - and had to go through the 2nd TSA security screen again. During this screen, I was told I could not keep a bottle of jelly I had purchased in the gift shop (receipt still in the bag) because it was over the limit - how incredibly ridiculous is that? I wasn't leaving the area without my purchased jelly - I didn't break any rules and I was going to be penalized due to SWA sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates. At one point I was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage - seriously? I just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight - how on earth am I supposed to go get my bag? After speaking to the TSA supervisor and making it very clear I was not leaving without my jelly - the TSA agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test. I can't be the first passenger this has happened to and the TSA agents explained they had made SWA aware of this issue but nothing had been done. For goodness sake SWA, use a little common sense and fix this issue. Have passengers who have to use those gates for connecting flights enter a separate area divided by security glass or stop routing passengers to those gates if they are changing gates for connecting flights. The current situation is beyond frustrating and really is inexcusable - there has to be a simple fix and if it isn't a simple fix - you should still fix it because it is a huge issue for your customers. For now - traveler beware - if you are changing gates during travel - avoid the San Diego airport because if your connecting flight is through gates 1, 1A or 2 - you can kiss that water or any gifts you just purchased in the secure area of your last flight that are liquid good-bye.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to San Antonio via San Diego,July 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,5.0,yes

There was a wait of approximately 40 minutes. The second round of drinks took ages. I had ordered a second whisky which the staff conveniently forgot. I had to remind to which I was given a curt unapologetic ""it's being made""! That too by the chief purser a lady in her 50's. During the meal which was nice the wine came only once. I had to remind the stewardess to fill-up my long empty glass. The staff was not well-informed about the plane either. I asked one if it was the new 777 to which she replied that she did not know. She never bothered to find-out and inform either. I can say one thing about Emirates. The hardware is there but the 'software' still needs to be updated. Staff training on customer satisfaction has to be intensified. I would not recommend anyone to buy the Business Class unless it's only for the additional comfort. Service is definitely lacking.

Great contract lounge at ZRH (Aspire) operated by Swissport with a terrace from which one can do some great plane spotting. Offerings were also much better than the Senator lounge, the bean counters must be hard at work as usual at the LH group. On time departure and orderly boarding. 2x2 business seating, IFE and much appreciated quality catering. While flying in a metal tube with little distractions it is nice to be served a nice meal. The onboard chef was attentive and the chicken papillotte was very good. One can even enjoy a cup of Turkish coffee afterwards. Scheduled arrival into IST.

Jetblue Airways,2.0,M Beale,1st July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Never Again! I travel from NJ to Boston several times a year to visit family. Since I have 2 small children, ages 4 and 7, sometimes I fly because it is generally quick and easy. The Newark to Boston flight was slightly delayed and my tv did not work but was otherwise uneventful. The trip home from Boston to Newark was a nightmare. My family lives over an hour from the airport and on the drive I got a text from the airline stating the flight will be delayed an hour. We were having some bad weather so that was understandable. I just had to try to entertain my kids for a bit longer in the airport. We boarded the flight at the delayed time and sat on the aircraft for over half an hour just to be told by the pilot they did not get clearance from Newark and ""it may be another hour"" for take off. They let us deplane. After dragging my kids further around he airport to get snacks and games,I noticed that every single JetBlue flight in the terminal was extremely delayed. We returned to the gate to see a big cancelled on the flight board. No announcement made. We were then told to go to customer service to see about getting another flight. After sitting in an airport for hours, I now had to drag my kids to another spot to wait in a very long line. At the desk, the rep told me the flight was canceled because the delays caused the crew to ""time out"". Basically they up and left stranding a whole plane of people with nowhere to go. The rep offered me options on another flight which would land at a NY airport over 2 hours from my home or an 8 pm flight that she told me would most likely be delayed. Neither were reasonable options for my situation. I chose to take a flight at noon the next day since my kids were at their limits of patience. I asked for compensation since I would have to get a hotel for the night and was told no it was not their fault since they canceled for ""weather"". (Seems to me like the crew abandoning ship was why they canceled). Meanwhile other airlines were flying no problem. Now I had to drag my 2 exhausted kids through the airport to reclaim my bags and hope to secure accommodation for the night. I was told that most of the hotels at the airport were booked but the reservation agent at Logan found me a hotel 10 miles outside of the city. We had to wait for a shuttle during rush hour in the rain. A 15 minute ride turned into 40 minutes. What should have been a quick easy 45 minute flight turned into a 24 hour nightmare. It was needlessly stressful and exhausting.I felt like I was left stranded with 2 small kids. It had been a couple of years since I flew JetBlue and I used to love them. Not anymore. From the other reviews I read it seems like my experience is not uncommon. I will pay extra to use United next time, or Amtrak. I will not be using JetBlue anymore.

I contacted Orbitz and got refunded my insurance on the tickets ($66) and they told me to call United directly to try and get a refund with orders. After being on hold for 25 minutes with United the rep told me she could not transfer me to the department refund and that I would need to talk to Orbitz again so that they could contact them. Requested to speak with supervisor and she had me submit a form online for my refund. Terrible customer service and the worst part is that I only needed to change my flights to an earlier time and cancel my return flight (not my families ticket) and they still would not work with me. Never will work with United again. I'm a rewards member with Delta and American and come to find out the extra $50 or $100 you are gonna pay is 100% worth it.

I love the look in the aircraft as well. Cabin service was good but ground service was terrible especially in Gatwick Airport. Staff were unfriendly and not helpful at all. Another thing is that the inconvenient online booking system of Emirates. we are a family of 4, 1 of us must be booked separately because of extra baggage weight which lead to we cannot check in together. Furthermore, we successfully checked in online for the first 3 of us but another family member with the separated booking cannot check in online due to overbooked flight. Therefore, we went to the counter to check in and they gave us 4 new seats, including the other 3 of us who checked in online earlier with already selected seats. Also we got new seats without being informed. Also almost all the seats are taken during 47 hours before departure for our return flights, I wonder why.

Air Canada,5.0,A Ngui,10th May 2015,Flew YEG-YYZ-YEG April 22 and May 2 return. Was using their A320 with 3-3 abreast in Economy. Flight was 99% full and most travellers already paid and selected their seats. When my turn for the 24 hour seat selection check-in comes the reservation system selected what was left for me spouse and 2 children. With it being 3-3 we got the middle and aisle of either side in row 32 BCDE. This is the last row because the ones behind us were reserved for crew only. Its gets annoying as the 2 lavatories lineups extend past your row so you get a constant flow of people going in the almost 4 hour flight. Meals for purchase are fine for those that want it. The thing that ticked me off was only beverages were served complimentary. No snacks at all on this flight. There is one FA for business class cabin while two for the economy cabin. FAs are there to do their jobs and that is it. The boarding call in YEG was good where they actually boarded the Zone 3 properly by calling out pax with children board first and enough advance notice was given. In YYZ forget that. Zone 3 was not properly announced and it jumped from announcing Zone 1 hasty Zone 2 and a hurried Zone 3 general boarding with not enough time for parents with young children to board first announced. Its seems like a mess. I had to pay for my stroller since its not the umbrella type and their small dimensions. $25 each way. Really pathetic domestic service for AC as its a flag carrier and does not seem to be like one. Seating is the older one but legroom and seat pitch seems small already. Imagine if they decide to go with their high density seating like in their new 777s. When the person in front of me reclines I almost hit my knees.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,no

Even though they have a great selection, the hardware needs an upgrade. The call attendant button or light button did not work on my seat remote control. Also, I had multiple issues with air hostesses both on Mumbai-Doha and Doha-Atlanta leg. Even after the call attendant button was pressed, none of the air-hostesses paid attention and I had to call them while they were passing by in the aisle. I could see 3-4 other attendant lights switched on but nobody came by for 10 minutes or so. The meal timings were really bad. After they served us brunch at 11:30 AM Doha time, no food was served till almost 6 PM. Having reached Doha at 5 AM, just having 1 meal till evening was not what I had in mind.

In my experience, United Airlines consistently fails to get their planes off the ground on time. In addition to delays, I always have a better quaity experience with other major airlines. For instance, during my 6 hour flight last night from Honolulu to Denver, we were brought drinks 2 times, and no snacks were offered. Last month on a very similar (yet longer, approx. 8 hour flight) trip with Delta, they provided two complementary full, hot meals, many rounds of drink service, and they even came through the cabin 4 times with individual 16 oz bottles of Dasani. I will never fly United again if given the option.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to TUL via DEN,December 2016,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no

Qatar Airways,10.0,Robyn Gilbertson,4th September 2016,"Adelaide to Barcelona via Doha. Qatar Airways is the best airline we have flown with respect to comfort, food, and service, and their amenity kits are the best too. Being able to choose when to have your meals is a real bonus and the choices were good. There were a few hitches though. On the Adelaide to Doha leg (A350), my seat would not go all the way into the sleep position - there was a 6 inch gap between the fixed 'foot end' and the seat, and the head end was raised somewhat. Despite this, it was still very comfortable. There was only one movie which was anything close to my taste - more choice is needed for long-haul flights, in this case 13 hours. Qatar Airport was a big let-down. Why they don't have air-bridges is a mystery, especially in such a harsh climate.",A350 / A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,ADL to BCN via DOH,August 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Two issues: Very poor food on return trip. Not really edible at all and the plane was a few minutes late in LHR with getting a landing slot. We went merrily to the Maple Leaf arrivals lounge for a shower and a bit of food after the flight. We got there at 12.45 and was told it was closed for showers and limited for food. It says it closes at 1.30 and we thought there was plenty of time for both. Staff were lifeless. Very disappointing.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

American Airlines,9.0,D Swarts,18th August 2014,This is a general review of American Airlines. Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class. Maybe it's because I have so much experience that little things and small delays do not phase me but I have rarely had a problem so bad that I felt the need to contact AA customer service and I've never written a negative review. Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier. But throughout my near-million miles and 14 years flying AA I still recommend the airline to my friends and family to get them anywhere in the world they need to go safely on time and for a reasonable cost.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,yes

Pilots provided flight info and alerted passengers when turbulence was expected. The flight attendants handed out a printed flight schedule and menu outlining when services would be provided and they followed through on this. Lunch had three options, mid flight snack was a warm chocolate chip cookie and two options for pre-arrival snack. During the flight, the attendants came through three or four times to offer water. At the end of the flight, flight attendants came through the main cabin thanking passengers for flying Delta and handing out candy. The experience was very nice and a cut above the Air France flight we had from FRA to CDG to connect with this flight. In-flight experience noticeably better than other legacy carriers I have flown in the past year. The flights to FRA (RDU-DTW then DTW-FRA) were also good.

When we checked in they noted that we have 3 young children and changed our seats so we could have the front row seats enabling us to sit together and also be able to use their onboard cot for our 9 month old. Once on board the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. They attached the baby cot to the divider, my 2 older children, 6 & 3, saw the baby pack and wanted the blankets as they came with penguins (didnâ€™t say anything, they just poured!) and they were more than happy to supply these for them. The childrenâ€™s food was a good selection of food they actually ate, we were checked on regularly and we found the flight more relaxing than weâ€™d expected travelling with 3 small children!

United Airlines,1.0,Sara Smith,26th June 2015,"Denver to Calgary, I had checked two of my bags online the night before, and on arriving at the bag drop they proceeded to try and charge me an additional $500 US.

The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn't matter unless it's over the 70lbs max weight. Another lady working had rudely told me that I was not allowed to have three pairs of skis in my bag, even though there was nothing I could do about it. She ""let it slide"" and charged me instead.

Even on flights not longer than 40 minutes, they are serving drinks and there is a full service, the only difference being that on a longer flight you would maybe get a sandwich while on a short flight it's crackers.

Having pushed back from the gate we were told that a fuel pump had failed so rather than return to the gate and let us wait for the repairs in the lounge they parked us on a stand away from the terminal (Cheaper that way). Two hours later we finally left Birmingham. We noticed a 'Check Pilot' leave the flight deck to sit behind us for the flight to Newark. As we approached Newark the 'Check Pilot' re-entered the flight deck. He must have made either the Captain or First Officer nervous because we came in way too high and had to abort the landing, so around we went again by which time we had no chance of catching our flight to Orlando. The Captain informed us that the aborted landing was due to 'wind'. Yeh right, don't insult your passengers intelligence! On the ground we went to the United desk to get seats on the next flight down to Orlando. Desk clerk informed us that although we had four 'first class' seats booked and paid for, there were only three first class seats available, therefore one of the party would have to take a seat in 'coach'. OK these thing happen but we would obviously get a refund of the difference (about $250). That was in March 2015 - we made the claim in April 2015 on our return to the UK. Our travel agent received an offer from United of $100 and chose to make up the difference because of the trade we give him. We are still waiting for the refund from United! I travelled regularly between Birmingham UK and Jacksonville FL when the company was Continental with no problems. Since United have taken over, the airline is a disgrace.

After delays they switched our flight, on our connecting flight through London the plane had to land in JFK because of computer glitches and they did not feel safe flying over the ocean. After 2 hours of waiting to receive new boarding passes everyone finally boarded a new air craft that would take us instead. Once everyone was seated they immediately told us that there were glitches and we had to exit the plane and that there would be no new flights until the morning. At this point we had now missed an entire day in Venice, lost all of our money spent on hotels and tours in Venice. We have a friend that is there alone waiting for us now for days. After they made us exit the plane at 2am we spent over 3 hours talking with managers and attendants to find a new plane to Venice because at this point if we boarded the morning connecting plane through London we would miss the plane to Venice and the following plane to Venice would make us miss another day, which at that point we were supposed to be going to Florence. During the duration of time we spent after being exited from the plane, they put us on a completely different flight out of LaGuardia and promised that our bags would be moved from JFK to LaGuardia. As we just showed up to pick up our bags we have been told that in fact the bags were never taken off of the plane and are now in London.

Having read that TK is quite good I was a little bit disappointed.

Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun.

When we boarded to our surprise it was a Delta Air Lines Plane and we were given seating grade equivalent to Virgin`s Economy X. Not what we paid for. The Service is very low standard compered to Virgin`s Premium Economy. Firstly the pillow had dirty marks and hair all over it, but they were able to find me a clean one. The seats are narrower than Virgin`s Premium Economy. The hostess admitted she did not know the difference between the food packages and was handing out different ones to what passengers asked for. She rips them open to see & check if she got the right one. I got a ripped open one, no bother complaining. The bread rolls they brought around were literally rock cakes. Coffee served was cold and to get anything extra to drink was very difficult. When the hostess finally brought some water around she split it over me. Every seat is supposed to have a travel pack and mine missed out, no big deal but just part of the low grade service and care. The pocket that holds the instructions etc, still had the previous passengers rubbish. No Do Not Wake Signs as other Airlines have, so when you take off at 10.45 pm you do not really want to be disturbed 4-5 hours later, but Delta does.

A day before our scheduled departure, I canceled my husband's flight because he had a bad cold and was coughing too much to get on a plane. In my conversation with United, I was told how to file for a refund (even though my tickets were non-refundable). I traveled to San Francisco myself. The direct flight both ways went fine, but the return flight was remarkable. By chance, I ended up sitting next to my sister and brother-in-law who were returning to Boston from the same funeral. We chatted with one of the flight attendants who knew we were returning from a funeral. She was exceptionally kind and gave us complimentary snacks. Her kindness was greatly appreciated during our bereavement. After I returned home, I filled out the online Refund form to see about getting a refund for my husband's ticket. I explained that not only was he coughing too much to get on a plane for six hours but it would have been very inconsiderate to other passengers for him to be hacking away. United Airlines was kind enough to promptly issue a refund for my husband's unused round-trip fare - a full refund, not a credit for future travel. I appreciate the refund - the thought of having to pay for an unused round-trip ticket for a funeral would only add insult to injury. I am grateful to United Airlines for making a very unpleasant situation (me traveling across the country alone, without my husband, for my cousin's funeral) as comfortable and pleasant as they could.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Francisco,July 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,4.0,L DrÃ¼schner,12th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Hanover to Beijing via Munich. Flight HAJ to CKG via MUC/PEK, and return flight CKG to HAJ via SHA-PVG/MUC. Online booked at Lufthansa, the flight PEK-CKG was carried out as part of the Star Alliance by Air China with a LH flight number. In Hannover the luggage was labeled to CKG. I asked if the luggage had to be picked up in Beijing and re-boarded to CKG, I did not receive conclusive information in Hanover and at the boarding gate in Munich. The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint. On the flight from Shanghai to Munich I had problems with the adjustment of the footrest. The adjustment knob often fell out of its holder, making the operation of the footrest problematic.

United Airlines,1.0,T Barton,13th July 2014,On July 1 2014 my family and I were traveling to the Cayman Islands flight was cancelled 1 hr prior to our departure time due to bad weather in Houston. They tried to reschedule our flight for two days later we could not go two days later we had to return to work in a certain amount of time. Once we were on a flight that day the flight attendant reported to us that there was no bad weather and had no idea why our flight was cancelled. We were then sent to Houston airport where they got us on a flight to fly into Miami where our next flight could not leave until the next morning so we spent the night on the floor at the Miami airport. The experience to our destination was horrible flying United and their express flights. Once we were returning home on United they did not tell us we did not have to pay for our luggage again and let us pay again Once again the flight was unpleasant. Once we arrived into Houston our flight home was delayed again the experience with United Airlines was horrible and the flight attendants were very unfriendly.

United Airlines,6.0,Tercon Bojan,10th December 2014,For this 9 hour flight from Houston to Buenos Aires United uses a very old 767-300 with a 2-1-2 configuration in business class. The seats are the old Continental flat-bed seats which are angled ever-so-slightly towards the window. Although it's a flat bed the bed is very narrow and at my 190cm I could not stretch out. Felt like sleeping in a coffin! Also when you have to go to the bathroom it's quite the operation to step over your neighbour without waking them up. The service and food were OK although the plastic champagne flutes and the character-less dull white dinnerware could be improved upon.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,yes
Jetblue Airways,1.0,C Marlen,20th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Orlando. From 3:49pm to 7:30pm I received multiple emails of flight delays, then corrected to on time, then delayed, then on time, then delayed from 10pm departure to 1am departure. I called the airline to complain that this did not seem as a weather delay even though it was insisted multiple times that it was, but as internal issues, seeing as they knew the plane from NY was delayed to us by 2 hours and we kept receiving multiple changes. You can track a plane on flight aware and know when it will take off and land. I explained my case and the manager states â€œso you want a refundâ€. I said I think that is fair seeing as this is clearly not a weather delay because you can track the plane that was supposed to pick us up, and the airline knew since 3:49pm it was not going to make it. She refunded my money but did not say anything about cancelling our tickets. Maybe I am just ignorant, but I thought the airline was refunding my money because they valued their clients. Thankfully we realized she cancelled our tickets because the App no longer found our reservation. I called back to in fact confirm with a live person a manager cancelled my reservation without telling me, then had to void the refund, was charged again, and received our places back on the flight. Now I am sitting exhausted in the airport, as I write, being told the flight was delayed actually by a mechanical issue. Not by a flight delay from the planes previous destination, as I expected all along. But at least my husband and I have a ticket to board and didnt get to the airport with no reservation because the woman failed to tell me she completely cancelled our flight. That would have been another aggravating battle to deal with. What are we supposed to stay in Salt Lake City for the rest of our lives?!? As far as Iâ€™m concerned every passenger should be refunded for the lies this airline has said to their customers.

Emirates,8.0,Haider Hazrat,14th January 2015,DFW-DXB-BOM: Booked Emirates as it was the cheapest and got a very good deal. The aircraft from Dallas was A380 which cannot be doubted on its comfort. I requested an exit row seat and got it. Food was very good and tasty from Dallas to Dubai. However cabin crew didn't respond for long on 2 occasions I called through my seat button. Service from Dubai to Mumbai was okayish nothing great to talk about. Old Boeing 777-300 which was stinking. I think Emirates doesn't focus properly on one of its major markets India with respect to quality and service. Overall I would give 3.5 stars to Emirates. 4 for DFW-DXB leg and 3 for DXB-BOM leg.

Great if you are travelling alone and get a window seat and you have complete privacy. The FA looking after me was very friendly and attentive. The International Terminal D at DFW must be the best international transfer experience in the US better than most European airports.

Air Canada,1.0,Zackary Savoie,28th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Our flight from Seattle to Toronto via Vancouver was delayed for nearly an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flight even though we were assured by Air Canada representatives that they would wait.

A delay of around 7 hours since our original was to leave at 4.15. We asked Air Canada representatives for compensation and they gave us a measly 10$ food voucher which isn't even enough for a sandwich at this airport. When 22.30 finally arrived we were stuffed in economy class on a full flight and upon arrival were informed that our baggage was not to arrive until 8.30 the next day! So we left the airport 7 hours late with no baggage. And for having missed the birth of our cousin we get 25$ in food vouchers.

United Airlines,4.0,Amy Atwell,24th May 2016,"We flew from Buffalo, NY to Chicago and then to Maui in May 2016. The airline charges per suitcase. The female employee who was checking boarding passes at Buffalo was extremely rude. She got flustered when I pointed out that she had not given my niece's passport back to her and she stated, ""I thought you were all together! Next time you need to get here earlier. I almost unseated all of you!"" To which I replied that we had looked up what time to be there on United's website and it stated to be there an hour and a half before your flight, which we were. There was no entertainment available unless you brought your own hand held device. If you had your own hand held device, but didn't have earbuds or headphones, they didn't have any for you. It took my son six hours to watch a two hour movie because the WiFi kept shutting down. They charged us for the meals on a 9 hr flight - charged us for the Italian sandwich, which is what we ordered, but they gave us the turkey sandwich which was cheaper. If the food has improved (as I've seen from some reviews), I would have hated to eat it before. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. We tried to upgrade and were told we couldn't. We were traveling with six people all together. They ruined 3 of the suitcases, one of them brand new. The steward staff on the return flight from Maui were very nice, polite, and professional, but it did not make up for all that we had already experienced.

The timing suits us, and service had also been reasonably good. But the service had been going downhill for the last year. You donâ€™t get a boarding bridge at Istanbul, the airport is so chaotic. On June 4, 2015 we were scheduled to fly from Boston. We had fully confirmed business class tickets. When we arrived at the airport, we saw an incredible scene. The passengers and check in crew were shouting at each other, very close to an all out fight. Apparently, the airline had overbooked the business class and was unable to provide seats to us all. It got very ugly and the Turkish Airlines supervisor was trying to persuade passengers to either fly economy class or fly the next day. Very ugly situation because so many people were involved. They offer discount online and overbook, hoping there will be some last minute cancellation. When there are no cancellations, people are asked to fly economy or fly next day. Apparently, these happen quite frequently in Boston. Anyway, to get to my experience, we did not get our seat. They offered us hotel and flew us the next day. Faced with no alternative, we had to accept their offer and we flew the next day. Turkish Airlines also promised token compensation of money back, and double mileage earned.

A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent. Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised! The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful.

United Airlines,1.0,Charles Flynn,1st January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York La Guardia to Vancouver via Chicago. The New York to Chicago flight was nice trip and bumpy so service was suspended for safety reasons. Chicago to Vancouver a nasty air crew looking to upset customers. We sat in the third row or first of premium economy. We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home.

Air Canada,2.0,S Thaylin,8th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Vancouver to Edmonton. As I waiting for the flight at the gate, I heard a call for 4 volunteers who are able to take the next flight. The announcement also said those who volunteer will get a $400 cheque. I was the 2nd volunteer who went up to the female attendant at the gate and she dealt with all the paperwork and informed me that I was booked for the midnight flight. So, as per my previous plans I originally arranged for my parents to pick me up at the airport. As I took the next flight and was confirmed by the attendant, I informed about the change in time for my pick up. I was told by the attendant at the gate that I would get the $400 and my boarding pass after all passengers had boarded. After a while when everyone had boarded, I heard my name being called to the gate. I went up and talked to the other male attendant. He quickly asked for my ID and gave me a boarding pass and I was rushed to board the original flight. I was very confused and stressed with the sudden changes to the plan as I thought I was already confirmed and scheduled for the next flight. As I boarded the plane, I was told to quickly load my carry on in the front overhead compartments and I took my seat as per the boarding pass. The plane started to take off as soon as I was seated so I did not have enough time to contact my parents about the changes. When I landed in Edmonton, I tried my best to call my parents again but they had already went to bed in order to wake up at midnight to pick me up as per my previous conversation. I did not have any other options other than waiting at the airport until 2:00 AM when they finally came to pick me up. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with the service and the lack of understanding I received from the attendants. This is also only second time travelling so I was very scared and nervous about the whole situation.

Qatar Airways,9.0,Craig Cutts,6th November 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | London to Tokyo via Doha. Checked in on line and choose seat a for both myself and my partner, bag drop at LHR T4 quick and polite security was very quick at 11am on a Thursday morning, was given access to the Skyteam lounge with my oneworld status? Qatar never offer there own lounge to FF but I guess it is advised in the rules. Anyway Skyteam lounge is pretty comfortable so fine. Boarded through gate A6 it was all very quick on to a newish clean A380 seats 31A & 31B on the upper deck.. Departed on time the flight wasn't full so a pretty nice atmosphere on board. Lunch served shortly after airborne was actually very nice lots of drinks offered during the flight with a hot sandwich tra coffee served about an hour before arrival. Had 3 hours in Doha which was a pleasant time visiting the shops onyx lounge and a walk around. Boarding the DOH-NRT flight from D22 via a bus however it wasn't too bad. The aircraft was spotless and strangely almost empty so while we had assigned seats we actually sat where we wanted with all but about 20 seats in the last cabin almost free. Departed on time again once airborne breakfast served quickly. I then slept across 4 seats for 6 hours once awake was offered coffee before I guess pre landing dinner which was okay but not as good as the previous flight. Landed on time after 9hrs 30min the whole trip was longer but much better than my usual BA. I have used QR about 20 times now in both business & economy. Economy upper deck on the A380 is difficult to beat. My first time on the 777-300ER with 3-4-3 seating and pleased it was pretty empty because I can imagine it would be pretty cramped when full.",A380 / Boeing 777-300ER,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Tokyo via Doha,November 2017,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,yes

Then, flight was delayed an hour, then it wasnâ€™t. Then it was time to hurry up and board. The line was a disaster. No one could tell where the line was. Or, exactly what was going on. Were we boarding or were we delayed? The app wasnâ€™t updated. People were worried about getting their carry-on bags on because they kept announcing that it was a full flight and they were worried about space. So people were trying to get on plane as fast as they could to secure space. People were cutting in line and being super aggressive. The people in charge could have cared less. They were oblivious to what was going on, but seemed hurried. We finally get on plane, many had to check bags which was time consuming. Now we sit on runway.

After explaining to him I had to be on that certain plane for a family emergency. He told me it wasnâ€™t his problem and I should have been at the airport earlier if it was important to me. Flat out most disrespectful attendant I have ever dealt with but doesnâ€™t end there. He got me another plane that brought me to San Fran airport then had to wait 3 hours to board another plane. And Recharged me a 35$ fee for layover when I already bought protection on my original tickets. When I tried to tell him I already paid for flight protection he walked off and got another attendant to help me. Then when I finally got on the plane all the flight attendants were rude.

At this point we are 4 hours out from our original departure time. Right as boarding was supposed to begin another hour was added to the delay. This is my first time flying alone. I am 18, unfamiliar with this airport. The pilot told us they checked the circuit at 7.10, when they realized there was an issue, 5 minutes before we were supposed to leave! Why wasnâ€™t this examined prior to boarding an entire plane of people? This is unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers time and money.

Stop was supposed to be a matter of 45 min but the crew announced there was a mechanical issue and a mechanic had to intervene. Waited for mechanic in the plane for two hours. After two hours were told to disembark because finally, the crew could legally not fly anymore. Were told to go into the terminal. Waited there for about three hours after which we were told we would do our immigration clearance in Bangor. Did immigration clearance but were then told to basically sleep over at the airport as our plane would only take off at 9am next day. So basically, all passengers slept on the floor at Bangor airport till the next day. Avoid United like the plague. That airline is just awful.

Flight out slightly older 777 seat not that comfortable and screen too small. Flight attendants the best I have met slightly more mature ladies with children so they really know how to help you out with a baby. They took it turns to carry my daughter around the cabin and went out their way to be helpful with food. Schipol airport is the best airport I have ever been to for small children. Dedicated lounge staff changing facilities cots for babies playgrounds all free. Food at Schipol great value and quality. Manchester is awful no help with luggage. no baby facilities welcome to blighty (not). Second flight to Manchester efficient and well run. Flight home was on a very windy day flight had a go around at Schipol. Schipol again fantastic for the little one. We had 90kg of luggage (even a baby bath) and KLM took care of everything for a small fee. Flight home to BKK again outstanding cabin staff (no dumb pretty trolly dollies) 777 though needs a refit.

Emirates,7.0,A Kabir,12th August 2016,"London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai flying with Emirates in economy class. There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite. At Dhaka our baggage took at least two hours to come even though in the domestic terminal we had another flight with a different airline 2 and a half hours after landing.

Air Canada,7.0,D Bracegirdle,29th September 2015,"In general Air Canada do a good job with their transatlantic flights and represent pretty good value for money (currently undercutting Air Transat on many flights). The planes offer standard legroom, a good level of cleanliness, attentive service and a really good infotainment system. They seem to have a consistent problem in my experience of boarding in a timely manner (nearly all my flights have left a little late). The food is generally good, and the drink service on my last flight was regular, generous and friendly. The downsides - the last 2 times I have flown with them they messed up my meal orders. The time before last they did not have a gluten free option as I had requested. The last time they gave me a gluten free meal with chicken in it. I am a fusspot gluten free/veggie (which had been noted on the agent website's booking form), luckily my wife had the vegetarian meal which happened to be gluten free. Their official response - they can only cater for one dietary requirement. Sad to see this in the 21st century, so if you don't fit into a particular box, bring your own food along to avoid disappointment. Fair do's to Air Canada though, they do keep offering money off when they mess up, but I would prefer a meal I can eat with no fuss or bother. My only other minor dislike is having the headphone socket on the armrest of the seat where it is really easy to knock it out or damage the socket.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to London,July 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes

He told me the flight had cancelled but I had an option to take the flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight to Singapore, and assured me I would be in Singapore by 11pm. He disappeared for around 45 minutes and then came back to collect me at 7.20am. But as the flight was due to depart at 7.40am we had to run to the other side of the airport. At the gate he gave the boarding card for the connecting flight then rushed us onto the aircraft. Only when the plane was taxiing did we discover the boarding card was for a flight that didn't land until 00.15am! He hadn't the courtesy to tell us we were on a different connecting flight. We were met at KL and given paper to put our details as the luggage had not made the flight, but would be couriered to us. 24 hours after landing the luggage hadn't arrived.

Turkish Airlines,9.0,Marc Guillemard,25th March 2015,"Flew from Paris to Samsum via Istambul and return in Economy. From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight. Istanbul airport is not at the same level but it's an other story. Safety demonstrations done in all 4 flights general condition of the aircraft's from good to excellent.

American Airlines,2.0,T Meales,24th June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Tampa to Nashville via Charlotte. First and foremost when I booked my flight, I booked it so I would leave out of my home city Sarasota/Bradenton. I was to leave at 5:00 on a Friday morning. At 10:30 p.m. on Thursday I get a text that my flight has been cancelled. Of course I immediately call AA and am told it will take one and half to two hours before I even get a return call. I wait for about an hour and try again. Rather than giving me the call back option this time, they recognize my number and ask me to hold. I do so for about 45 minutes. Eventually I get a customer service representative and my only option is to fly out of Tampa airport the next morning. They initially had me rebooked on a 10:30 a.m. Flight from Tampa but by the time I got into Nashville and then drove two hours to where my daughter lives, all of Friday would have been wasted. So I rebooked on a 5:00 a.m. Flight, getting into Nashville at the same time I would have if my Sarasota flight hadn't been cancelled. By this time it's 1:00 or so in the morning. That leaves me about an hour's worth of sleeping time before I have to get up and leave for the Tampa airport. While I made the flight on time and the customer service representative was very helpful in getting me on that flight, the fact remains I had to drive an hour to the airport and park my car whereas if I had left from Sarasota like I normally do, I would have used Uber and not incurred $90 in parking fees (plus two hours of driving time and tolls). American Airlines refuses to reimburse me. If I had missed my flight you can be sure I wouldn't have gotten a refund or any other courtesy. All I want is a refund of the parking fees.

Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,A LeClair,21st January 2015,"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker.

On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto.

In any case my spouse had similar issue on the flight from Toronto to PHL in June 2013. So this looks like a pattern.

She received a text at 7 pm on April 19 stating that her flight had been cancelled. The reason she booked an early flight was so she could be in Colorado Springs shortly after our son gets off work. Heâ€™s stationed at Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs. She was booked a flight 6 hours later than originally. Which puts her coming into Colorado Springs about the time he leaves for work. Not a lot of time for him to pick her up, get back on base, get her checked in at a room on base and then get to work. She called to see why her flight was cancelled and the CSR said it was due to maintenance.

They told me there wasnâ€™t anymore overhead bin room. Great, I get that, but mine fits under the seat as I premeasured my bag. They said they didnâ€™t care, they didnâ€™t have overhead bin access so I had to check my bag. I told them I understand that there isnâ€™t but mine fits under my seat. They then tried to say that it didnâ€™t matter because I had two bags, the second being my purse... since when do purses count? But that could also fit in my bag so i put my purse in my bag.

American Airlines,5.0,Steve Bryant,20th April 2015,"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class.

Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy.

Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue.

American Airlines,1.0,J Wickham,12th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I had a flight Miami to London Heathrow via Boston. The check in was an unnecessarily stressful and upsetting experience caused by the unprofessionalism and aggression of American Airlines ground staff. After 30 minutes waiting in line the ground crew member informed those of us waiting there that the five desk staff were finishing their shift and we had to leave the line. Despite protests from my fellow passengers the woman informed us the staff would â€œup and leaveâ€ when their shift was finished. I am sympathetic that their shift was over but surely it would have been more effective to allow those of us waiting to check in or be served by other desk staff. I have never seen staff upping and leaving when there is a long line of people waiting without making sure they were to be attended to. I was then instructed to join the general enquiry line. In this line were people who had missed connections, missed flights, rebooking flights, unable to check in manually, oversized baggage, etc. The staff appeared to be directing people to lines in order to be rid of them and did not allow questions to be finished nor addressing passengersâ€™ issues. Just a simple â€œgo stand in that lineâ€. The complaints from my fellow passengers echoed my own disbelief that at one point less than five desk staff were there to serve the long line of people and there was no coordination of passengers who had little time until boarding. I tried in vain to ask if another check-in option was available - highlighting my fear I would miss my connecting flight to London if I missed the domestic flight - but was continually dismissed. After two hours of waiting I was finally able to check in my luggage and thanks to the security staff allowing me to fast track through security I made the flight.

Air New Zealand,,W Richards,13th December 2013,Appalling service at Sydney airport 12 December 2013 on NZ 104 (Sydney - Auckland). As a monopoly and price gouger Sydney Airport's reputation can't sink any lower but to put a 767 on an outside stand is just daft. Yes one of the planes at the airbridge was undergoing technical maintenance but I cannot believe in this day and age another airbridge was not available. However it was the resulting treatment of passengers that was the concern. A bus to the aircraft in over 30 degree heat - and then left locked in the bus (right alongside the aircraft) no windows or doors open for fifteen minutes. Most passengers have no seat and the temperatures were rapidly rising. Requests to open doors and windows went unheeded. Apparently the flight attendants had not been informed passengers were on their way. A lack of communication between aircraft and airport - not a good look for an airline at all!,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,no

Emirates,4.0,Ramon Iglesias,26th August 2014,Traveled SIN-DXB-BCN and MXP-DXB-SIN on Economy. On the flight outbound nothing special besides the connection in Dubai the filthy and overcrowded toilets in DXB which is still not up to the standard of Changi in Singapore or HKIA and the wifi that I could never get going (and I wasn't the only one). On the flight DXB-BCN on the 380 they ran out of cold beers and had to serve warm beers declined the suggestion and opted for red wine which was also warm so I just asked for a glass of water hoping this one would be fresh. There seemed to be friction between the FA's as I was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didn't look very professional. On the way back from MXP we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. Nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded. Managed to get to my gate (after a long walk) and boarded the flight. Nothing special the meal trays seem a lot skinnier than you get on Singapore Airlines or Qatar. FA's doing their job and that's it nothing like Thai Singapore or Cathay they are young but not very service oriented. And last but not least they lost my bag. I am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but don't expect a whole new dimension it is just an OK airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated self-attributed reputation with below average delivery.

Flight was late/rebooked out of Peoria due to bad weather at DFW, then couldn't land at DFW so had to refuel in Wichita and sit there a couple hours, then finally got to DFW at about 12:30a & it was about 1a by the time I had gotten to talk to a gate agent about flights home. Many customers had to sleep in the airport. All hotels were reportedly booked & American made no effort to help us find lodging. I tried several hotels and finally got to one at 2:15am. Left out of DFW the next morning, got to Houston, but my luggage was sent to the wrong airport (IAH instead of Hobby). My destination had been changed the previous day (Houston Hobby, then IAH, then Hobby again due to flight delays, cancellations, etc), but they assured me repeatedly that the bags would be delivered to the correct airport. The AA app showed I had checked 4 bags when I had only checked two. I called AA and straightened it all out but when my luggage wasn't delivered to my home I had to call again and they said they had no record of the prior call and that they might not be able to get luggage delivered to me until next day. I finally gave up and drove 20 miles to IAH myself to get the bags. Worst treatment I've ever experienced on an airline. The weather isn't their fault but dumping us off at DFW after midnight w/ no assistance to find lodging, and the incompetence without my bags, is inexcusable.",,Business,Economy Class,Peoria to Houston via DFW,September 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,1.0,Carmen Fron,16th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | My last trip on United Airlines left me feeling angry, tricked, humiliated and disrespected. The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines' basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one's boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one's allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment that they cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter's personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child's size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before getting to the airport. One is forced to print one's boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process with having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, but I was able to get the bag into the box. I was very tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter's very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. The suitcase fit with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. The kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn't even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to get another attendant to finish printing them. The attendants are there for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever.

My husband and I originally booked our tickets to San Francisco and had to pay an additional $100 for the option to sit together and have a carry on! How does one go on vacation without clothes?! The trip fell through and we ended up changing to go to Cancun, Mexico instead. We were charged $400 plus about $50-100 in processing fees to change. Not only that, we were met with many additional costs that are new to us. I have flown many international flights and have always been given a meal. On this flight however, we were given a bag of pretzels and would be charged extra for snacks or a meal. I have also never been charged extra for a checked bag on an international flight. (We were actually allowed a carry on) Lastly, I have never been charged to watch tv. United offered no free entertainment and their directv option was $8.

Inflight staff and staff in both airports were extremely rude and snobby, always looking down on you. Generally quite unprofessional. The staff on our flight told us not to call a flight attendant for beverages, instead we were supposed to go to the back of the plane and request them (unheard of on a long haul) .I told them this was ridiculous and that I would do no such thing as that would involve waking up a fellow passenger sleeping next to us on a aisle seat. We were delayed by 2 hours due to a technical issue and there was no update from the captain on whether or not we would make up the time. Check in and airport staff in JFK need to learn some customer service skills. No smiling, rude people that generally look fed up in life and with their job. They sigh, they roll their eyes. Quite possibly the rudest staff I have ever dealt with. (I fly a lot with many airlines).

It seems to me like emails about delays should not have been sent out if the flight was going to leave on time.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,,M Pandya,21st April 2014,I have traveled YYZ-AMS-BOM through KLM for 5 times in last 8 years and the quality of service is deteriorating as time progresses. I was happy to get a good deal for my trip only to realise that now I can carry only one piece of baggage on international flight (Jet Airways still allows two pieces of luggage at same price). YYZ-AMS leg was the most uncomfortable one with hardly any legroom on Boeing 737. Once you fit yourself in the seat it is a mammoth task to pry yourself outside of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers. The seats themselves are pretty uncomfortable too. Thankfully YYZ-AMS leg lasts only 6 hours. I ordered Asian vegetarian meal - big mistake - tasteless food. Dessert contains only few pieces of fruit. The staff seemed ok - not courteous though. They seemed to be doing their duty but customer service is definitely not their focus. AMS-BOM leg was operated by Delta and hence space was not a constraint. Better service than KLM.

Granted, it would be no cost to us however the frustrating part about this is they said nothing about my bag that was the exact same size, not to mention the numerous other passengers we saw pass us to board the plane with same size bags or larger. Ours both fit perfectly fine in all the overhead bins we had used in previous AA flights. I tried to ask the agent if this was necessary considering I was not asked to check mine even when it's the same size but she insisted it was. I feel as if American Airlines targeted us (my wife) for no apparent reason. We did not want to check our bags for a reason, they met the size requirements and we wanted to be able to get off the plane and not wait for our luggage. In addition to all this, they had us board the plane and sit at the gate while they fixed 3 machanical issues before pushing off.

On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. There's a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard.

IFE was AVOD but screens were from previous century and picture quality poor selection was OK. WBC seats were just angle-flat and rather tired but comfortable for resting on a day flight. FAs were brilliant attentive and doing their job with a smile. Food served was quite good. Salmon Tartare and Indonesian Chicken Curry (or 2 other choices of Beef or Plaice) for lunch. Chili Prawns and Indonesian Beef (or Cod) for the second meal. It was nice that the product featured some Dutch (Indonesian) elements throughout the flight and was not just generic. Wines served were also nice with some interesting choices not just the standard fare. KL uses a shared airport lounge in VIE which is not particularly great but in line with other lounges in VIE and at least not overcrowded. KLâ€™s Non-Schengen lounge in AMS was nice and spacious with a decent selection of drinks but with limited food choices. Transfer in AMS involved walking long distances but was otherwise hassle free.

Turkish Airlines,7.0,Tania Ferrara,22nd March 2016,"Our family of 4, flew with Turkish airlines from London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul return. London to Istanbul the aircraft was excellent, equipped with the latest entertainment - essential for keeping the kids occupied! The staff on board were so friendly and welcoming. From Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur, I couldn't help feeling as if we had been 'downgraded' as the front row in which we were sitting, only 1 out of 4 screens worked! One was stuck and 3 didn't work, so as there was ample space behind, my husband and son moved backwards, which was ok but meant we were sitting separately for most of the flight. The staff were less friendly than the first. These two factors made me feel a little disheartened. On our return journey, from Kuala Lumpur to London via Istanbul, we had an excellent journey. The entertainment was excellent, food was delicious, toilets were maintained and kept clean to a high standard and the staff were superb. However on the last leg of the journey, from Istanbul to London, we were very disappointed with the aircraft itself. It felt as if we were on a low cost carrier, as there was literally no entertainment onboard as there seemed to be a technical glitch on all the screens. That was a huge disappointment, as we expected to have a good quality plane, having paid a premium price for the journey. But the staff were exceptional and did their best to cater for us, ensuring the children were comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed flying on Turkish Airlines. They seem to take pride in the cleanliness of their aircraft, which says a lot about an airline. The food was to a high standard and the kids were gifted various toys as souvenirs of their journey. I would definitely consider flying with Turkish airlines in the future.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to KUL via IST,March 2016,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,yes

Jetblue Airways,1.0,Rebecca Maxfield,22nd April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Puerto Plata to Boston. We called JetBlue to book our seats immediately after we booked our all inclusive trip with using JetBlue (as we always use them But never will again). They told us that we had to wait until 24 hours before to book our seats or we would pay extra, interesting. This has never been the way it worked previous, seeing as we take a few trips a Year And we try to fly JetBlue (not anymore Of course And it seems from the reviews that JetBlue doesnâ€™t care About customer satisfaction anymore). Families were scattered everywhere ... even 5 year olds By themselves. But the worst was on our way back. There were not enough seats when we went on to book 24 hours Before the flight, so I chatted with this women, and saved our chat for social Media. Jetblue used to have great customer service. This lady was not professional or helpful. Said we should just go to the airport, JetBlue never fully books. Well we chose To pay $30 Extra each so we could get home safely in time. Again, familyâ€™s complaining, everyone split up. Today, I get a text from my co worker, JetBlue overbooked. People have to give up their seats, her being one of them. Never using JetBlue again. Oh and your TV didnâ€™t work on both flights. On the way back they rebooted so they began to work but they werenâ€™t playing the movies that were supposed to be playing.

Without an announcement, passengers are oblivious to the fact that their open window shades have any effect. I am not suggesting ""forcing"" anyone to close a shade, but most people would be glad to cooperate if asked to do so politely. Other airlines do this.

Ate at Kamloops as had a delay which was just as well as the food was again disgusting on the long haul flight. Have used this Airline to get to Sun Peaks ski resort for the last 10 years as it is difficult to travel with any other 'joined up' airline with times to suit. i.e. Air Canada to Vancouver then Jazz to Kamloops.

We made it, but not by much. Seats on the A380 are great, but we were prevented from using toilets closest to us (reserved for 1st class we found out) and having to go to the back of the Business cabin to use an inadequate number of dirty toilets for what turns out to be a huge cabin.

Pros - Overall it is a very comfortable seat nice and soft bedding with a mattress pad small cabin (only 8 seats) great inflight entertainment system and friendly service. Cons - Food was subpar for international first and the appetizer was a spring roll and a coconut rubbed shrimp skewer - very similar to what you might find in a cheap cocktail party. Soup was served in a teacup sized bowl main was ok desert was ok too if you like ice cream as that is the only option. If United wants to compete with other international first class it needs more refinement style and ""class"" in their product. As I used award miles for this seat it was perfectly fine.

However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles.

Jetblue Airways,1.0,Jon Anthony,2nd July 2015,"Comically mismanaged operation. Problems began when the departure gate was mobbed- seems an earlier flight had 'technical problems', so it departed an hour late at my original gate. We were then redirected to an alternate gate, and waited. And waited. And waited. They now had us waiting on the plane with 'technical problems' and they basically had the other flight go out with our intended jet, and we were stuck. It took text message from my daughter thousands of miles away to inform me the flight was finally cancelled. Not one word from JetBlue staff at the boarding gate. Finally, 2 hours after scheduled departure, they announced baggage was at the carousel, and ""being monitored by JetBlue associates"" I went down to claim my bag - no JetBlue staff in sight. I quickly went to ticketing, got an apology and refund from the embarrassed support staff, and proceeded to Southwest, where I ended up having to pay +$500 more for their next direct flight with a confirmed seat. I understand this is a mechanical industry and there will be problems, but it's how an airline manages the problem that is a mark of their business integrity and customer focus. How a major airline doesn't keep a backup vessel on site is mind boggling to me, let alone the abject lack of communication to the paying customer.",Airbus 320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Tampa,July 2015,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

Feel free to call customer service or come up to this desk to be moved to a stand by list for another flight."" I looked at my wife questioningly. Had they really just said that? I looked at the crowd of people now hopping to their feet. We spent the day rushing from gate to gate trying to catch flights on a standby list with sixty other people from a cancelled flight. Why hadn't they just waited for another plane and delayed our flight two hours instead of having us run from gate to gate trying vainly to catch flights that were always overbooked? As we waited we heard stories of other cancellations, horrendous customer service, and an overall lack of any sympathy from American Airlines for the trouble they were causing their customers. ""I'm not going to book with American Airlines again."" I told my wife. She agreed that we should try to avoid it. On our way back to Spokane our plane was delayed two hours without explanation. ""Our plane has just landed and is unloading now."" the gate attendant announced to us, half an hour prior to scheduled boarding. Three and a half hours later we finally got on the plane. We were in the last group to board and we sat in a stationary plane for another half hour before it moved at all.

There are other airlines more committed to their customer service, value and accommodations with similar prices. Disappointment after disappointment. Long story short things change and I ended up needing to change the time of my flight. Their policy is a 200 dollar change fee which was just as much as the ticket. I even purchased the misleading insurance just in case this might happen and they ONLY cover it if the airline changes or cancels... useless. Other airlines including southwest and jet blue have change fees as low as 60 and some free! So apparently they have a better handle on how to accommodate their flyers. Then I get to the airport and your only allowed one personal shoulder bag or purse, no carry on. I had the tiniest purse and had to check my 15 pound carry on. I didnâ€™t know Airlines donâ€™t allow carry ons these days. (I purchased the basic ticket which was not that much cheaper than other airlines.

The flight took off on time and it was a full flight so knew the service would be slow but waiting 90 minutes after take off for any refreshment is poor by Emirates standards. No pre dinner drink just the food and then another wait for drinks. Crew were surly and clearly didn't want to be at work that day. Asked for another drink to be grunted at by the stewardess who moaned she would have to write my drink down as a few people were asking. If they had been pro active and commenced a drinks service before the food maybe people wouldn't be asking for another drink so soon after the meal. Cabin crew then disappeared and not offered anything else until 2 hours before landing when they came round with afternoon tea. A very small sandwich and a tiny scone.

After all check-in, security clearance process, I was informed that the flight is cancelled while boarding. They didn't send any notifications to mobile or email.

After one hour of waiting, I got frustrated and called their customer service while staying on the line. I was on call-wait status for 50 minutes before getting hold of someone in their customer service. Customer service agent couldn't rebook me on next day flight unless I'm ready to do a 3 stopper instead of 1 stopper that I booked. I got the same itinerary 2 days later and asked him to book it. He couldn't book me because I was already checked-in and they needed me checked out from airport side. He said he will do all that and call + email me later with confirmation. I never received any call or email till today. I called their customer service again and was able to get hold of someone after 30 minutes wait. I got the same answer today as well. They have asked me to call them again after 4 hours. Not sure how long I should be on hold to get hold of them. And their website still shows the flight status as delayed and not as cancelled.

For the return flight we had to change flights in the office in Delhi. Come to find out that there was another flight out of Moscow with a 3 hour layover. We switched to that flight. The office workers in Delhi were also cold and rude. As it turns out by the time we landed from Delhi in Moscow and got to the terminal to fly out that 1 hour layover flight had already left.

The LHR-DOH was on a refurbished A330 so the flight was pleasant with a good sized IFE screen and a sufficient selection of films. However the letdown on this flight was the catering which was a running theme throughout all of the flights as well as the attitude of the cabin crew who looked as if they did not want to work. The DOH-RGN flight was good on the small A319 which only had 60 Passengers on board this helped as it meant the crew were more attentive. For the return we tried to upgrade at the Tokyo office offering to pay however we were told that because the DOH-LHR leg was full we could not even pay for the HND-DOH leg meaning the flight would have empty business class seats. The flight however from HND-DOH was very nice as the Tokyo office sent a message to check in stating that we would like extra legroom seats which was a nice touch. The DOH-LHR flight on the other hand was terrible a downgrade from the A380 to the A340 meant that the flight was totally full and the plane was showing its age with broken seats and dirty toilets. The crew also didn't help the flight by not smiling and ignoring the call button for passengers. All in all I was dissatisfied with Qatar Airways.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,no

Emirates,4.0,Ravish Thomas,19th September 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Emirates has lost it's edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress. Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions. Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers. One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters. Overall, I am quite disappointed with Emirates and next time I fly this sector, I might seriously consider other airlines.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DXB to LHR,September 2016,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no

Air New Zealand,5.0,Philip Harvey,28th January 2016,"A real mixed bag with Air New Zealand from Auckland to Shanghai, great flight with bad ground service. The trip got off to a couple of bad starts, I couldn't check in from Queenstown to Geneva since the tickets were not connnected, so I had to drag my luggage between the terminals in Auckland. Then when I tried to check in for Geneva from Auckland they would only check me in to Shanghai since apparently Air NZ can not check people in to transit Shanghai to Air China. This needs to be fixed since I spent 2 hours in queues to get out and back into the airport in Shanghai, I would never fly this route again because of this problem. The terminal walkway in Auckland really needs to be covered since it is frequently raining, it is a bit of a national disgrace that uncovered walkway, not a good way to great arriving tourists. Flying the Dreamliner made this longhaul flight more pleasant, the higher humidity and cabin pressure left me feeling less drained than usual. The entertainment system is excellent with gate to gate service and a good selection of movies. Most importantly the system does not have boxes under the seats making a lot more legroom available. I was lucky to get a sky couch row to myself since the plane was only half full and was able to have the full sky couch to myself for sleeping.

Once the doors of the bus open it is survival of the fittest with a stampede of people to the stairs of the aircraft to see who can get on-board first. Once onboard, the stewardess insisted I put my carry-on on a different overhead locker since the one directly above my seat was partly in business class which was only had 2/3 of the seats occupied (middle seat deliberately not used) - never encountered such an issue before in 20 plus years of flying. Other people also having to deal with the ""difficult"" stewardess resulting in further delays to a flight that already had been delayed by 30 mins.

Air Canada,5.0,Cohen Jonathan,14th September 2014,"Toronto YYZ - Tel-Aviv TLV. Flew on new 787-8 aircraft in a standard economy window seat. The plane has only been in service since the early summer and it shows. It still looks (and smells) new. The climate control system pumped fresh air into the cabin the AC was very good. The windows on this plane are huge. The ambient lighting changed according to our journey's progress and provided a good general atmosphere. The entertainment system was excellent and fast responding with an extended selection of films TV shows games etc. Every seat came with a USB plug as well as AC power. Flight attendants were courteous professional and between them spoke 6 languages to cater to the various passengers. The overhead storage bins were very large. The cabin in general seemed spacious and pleasing. Before I review the seats and leg space please make note that I have small build 5'5"" (165 cm) and 132 pounds (60kg). Leg room was ok as long as you don't have carry on luggage on the floor. The seat reclined to a relative comfortable position (as far as an economy seat may be comfortable) although I didn't note a major improvement over other/older Air Canada planes including the 767-3 which was replaced by this plane on this route. The big problem with the seating in economy is the 3x3x3 configuration. The seats are narrow. I was lucky that nobody was sitting in the middle seat next to my window seat. The seat felt cramped without a person sitting next to me. It would've been almost unbearable to fly for 10 hours with someone next to me. Remember I'm smaller than the average person and couldn't imagine how an average or large person could last in an economy seat for such a long flight. Air Canada definitely dropped the ball with this seat configuration on an international flight. It might work for a short haul flight but not on a 10 hour flight. Simply outrageous design decision. Another inexplicable design decision was to mount controls on the arm rest exactly where you'd put your arm. There were several incidents witnessed during the flight where a passenger accidentally pressed the flight attendant button. The flight attendants reaction was as if it was a common occurrence. I myself accidentally pressed the seat lighting button a few times and changed the volume on my flight entertainment program. This is a very annoying design flaw especially if a stranger sitting next to you will push the buttons on your flight entertainment controls. Food was horrible possibly the worst meal I've come across specifically the main course for dinner as well as breakfast. One bite was more than enough to leave the food on the tray. The new plane has a lot going for it but is plagued by design flaws in economy that would most likely make the long journey in economy a very bad experience for almost every single person. Disappointing! I cannot recommend a flight on this plane in economy. My suggestion would be to pay the extra money to fly in Premium Economy. The seats looked far more comfortable and had had a better 2x3x2 configuration. I also suggest to eat prior to flying at the airport and/or buy food to eat prior to boarding.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,no

The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot.

Lufthansa,1.0,Z Navrenko,7th January 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Chicago to Moscow via Frankfurt. Extremely miserable experience from business class travel. Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane.

The seat comfort on three segments was slightly disappointing as the seats were identical to economy class ones just the middle seat blocked off with the sole exception of the IST-ASM flight that featured the new business class configuration. The food offered on board by DO&CO was fresh and generous in both quality and quantity without being to overwhelming. The ambience and general service on board was genuine and of high standard without being too pompous as with most premium products. The cabin crew were extremely polite and professional and most seemed to be warm and quite friendly. Ataturk Airport is wide and spacious offering all functioning facilities the security procedures are very lenient and quickly handled with no hassle or long waiting. The customer service staff at Ataturk Airport are satisfactory as most don't seem very keen to assist you although they do their jobs. Turkish CIP Lounge at IST is very accommodating offering a soothing environment with generous food offerings and comfortable ambience. Flights landed and departed more or less on time.

Air Canada,1.0,S Gurjal,3rd April 2015,My husband and I flew to Vancouver on Air Canada from Newark on March 11 2015. We were to take off at 6.30pm and reach Vancouver by 9.53pm At 5.45pm there was an announcement asking for eight volunteers to get off loaded. We started boarding at 6.20. At 7.00pm there was an announcement that an off loaded passenger's baggage couldn't be located. At 8.00 they located it. The pilot then said he would need to refuel! Finally it was 8.30pm when we were finally on our way. We reached Vancouver by 11.30. Our return on Monday March 16th was equally terrible. Our flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9.10am and reach Montreal by 4.54pm. Our connection to Newark was to take off at 6.10. The flight didn't take off till almost 11am. In fact we had left the gate when the pilot announced a weight balance problem and brought the plane back to the gate to refuel. At 12.30pm when service was finally rendered there were no lunch items - only breakfast items to be purchased. When we landed in Montreal it was past 5.15pm. Even though we had informed the crew that we had to make an international connection we got no assistance. Our seats were at the back and it took 10 minutes to get out. There was no ground crew to assist us. We had expected a cart that would take us from the domestic to the international terminal for a quick transfer. On foot it was a very long walk. After quickly completing immigration and customs we reached the gate by 6.04. The gate had just closed - ironic that the only Air Canada flight our entire trip that took off on time was that one! They put us on an Air Canada flight to LaGuardia adding three hours of ground transportation to our already exhausting day. That flight left half an hour late reaching around 9.00pm. We had to buy tickets for ground transportation to take us from LGA to Newark since our car was at Newark airport's long term parking. We reached the car park by midnight and finally arriving home early next morning! There was no apology from Air Canada even though it was the airline's fault. Further there was no attempt by the airline in any tangible way to make the bad experience a little more bearable.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,no

Besides the beverage cart pass in the first hour and last hour of all 4 to 6 hour flights, the attendants passed water and/or coffee at least twice. The domestic B767 aircraft was showing it's wear, particularly with the IFE, which worked OK at best, but it was clean and everything worked. The internationally configured B767 is very nice, with new, comfortable seats, a large screen and excellent movie choices (to and from HI they are complimentary).

Virgin America,1.0,S Walter,3rd September 2012,"Boston to Los Angeles with my two boys. One has a peanut allergy and although I don't expect accommodation just for him I was surprised that I was basically ignored yet other airlines always provide a ""buffer zone"" as well as a peanut-free environment. We were not informed our seats did not recline. Having a medical implant in my neck and a head rest that couldn't be adjusted I was in pain. There were 3 empty seats behind us. My boys moved to them because they were so uncomfortable. I was about to join them but they were told by one of the flight attendants that they couldn't sit there. Apparently they each cost $129 more and I would need to pay $387 to have seats that reclined. The seats were empty but still given my situation I wasn't allowed to sit there with my boys who were very upset. What I cannot accept is the fact that a man in my row sneaked to the same row across the aisle and sat there the whole flight for no additional fee.

Qatar Airways,9.0,D Lee,20th May 2015,Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good.

Lufthansa,7.0,Rohith Jayawardene,2nd March 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Frankfurt Business Class. I usually don't pay inflated prices for European Business Class flights, where it's just the economy seat with the empty middle seat. But I was on Premium Economy for the long haul part from Frankfurt to Bahrain, and was offered an upgrade to Business Class for the short haul sectors for a very low fee, which I took. And I was not disappointed. On boarding, I was greeted with a smile. The flight attendants were professional but not necessarily engaging, although they did address me by my name. No hot towel, welcome drink or IFE. But the food was excellent in both directions, considering it's an hours flight. Outbound was a tasty cereal with fruits and on return, a delicious tuna salad with hot bread and premium brand bar service, with refills. I really enjoyed these flights and was impressed with the good service. The seats, though hardly any leg room, surprisingly felt comfortable too. Both flights were on time. But I still would avoid paying Business Class fares on European routes. Checking prices (two days prior to departure), I noticed that the BC flight LHR-Frankfurt-LHR was only little cheaper than the fare from LHR-Bahrain-LHR on Premium Economy!

That being said however, they were very efficient and fast. Moving on, the seats on both flights were comfortable and just ample for the regional midrange operations of the company, but the lack of on-board entertainment was evident. The food despite tasting good, was of very small portions and the fact that no hot beverages were served on the DÃ¼sseldorf-Athens 3 hr leg was not appreciated. Athens airport is nice, easily navigable and efficient however, a layover longer than three hours will be boring and food options were not enough.

United Airlines,7.0,Mark Jensen,17th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Lisbon to Newark. The new Polaris Business class of United is a very nice product. The seats are comfortable, the screen is a nice size and the new amenities kit is excellent. The seats are lie flat and offer a great rest. However, they are somewhat difficult to adjust at the intermediate levels, the upright and lie flat are done at the push of a button. Other than that, the only complaint I had was for the lack of storage on the seat - the old seats (and this may have been the ones in first) and small nooks to store stuff. That is not the case here, or at least I did not find them - so the storage has to be done in the overhead bins. Besides the very comfortable oversized pillow, United also provides you with two blankets, a regular one, and a slightly heavier quilted one. I initially used the quilted one, but since the temperature in the cabin was quite comfortable I eventually gave up on both. The food is a little lacking, for the first course, I chose the Halibut which was very good but second meal was a very dry and flavorless piece of chicken breast. This, in my opinion, is a problem, primarily because it is served an hour before landing and sticks in people's memories as their meal experience. The service while professional is not on par with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. While I cannot put my finger on it simply lacks the elegance and savoir-faire of their counterparts. Another big issue is the entertainment, while there is an excellent selection I cannot for the life of me understand why I constantly have to be subjected to Barracuda and Marriott advertising - it is not just once, but after every single show that I want to watch. This really cheapens the United brand, if you want to do it on the domestic legs to offset the entertainment costs the so be it - but to do it on the international leg in business class is unheard of. United is definitely on to something with Polaris, with a little fine tuning this could become a Business Class for others to follow.",Boeing 767-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Lisbon to Newark,2017-05-01 00:00:00,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,yes
American Airlines,3.0,C Napier,10th May 2014,LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no

Emirates,3.0,Nilanjan Panda,29th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | We are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance Emirates flights. In our recent experience, there was only one meal served during our flight from Manchester to Dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. A tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. There were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. On the Dubai to Kolkata flight (duration of 4 hours), the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks (which were tiny packets of savoury mix) to fill in. Not to mention, the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. Desserts were horrendous.

After our Qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the Emirates desk being checked in for EK413 to Sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience. We have flown Emirates before and had reservations which had led us to avoid them for this trip to New Zealand. Unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. The plane was brilliant, newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. The main problem is with the service and staff. Business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. When I informed the attendant that I did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. I did not have a dedicated attendAnt for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. No hot drinks were served after the meal.

United Airlines,1.0,Paul Martin,5th August 2016,I recently planned a trip with a friend to Colorado then on to California. All flights were with United. Circumstances caused my friend to have to change to an earlier flight and leave for California without me. Since I had made all travel arrangements I called United's customer service line to make the changes. They said it would cost $200 to change flights. I said that was no problem and they gave me a departure time and flight number. I got off the phone relieved that I was able to get a flight for him at the correct time. Some time later I realized that I had not been asked for any payment information. That couldn't be right so I called customer service back and spoke with an agent who assured me that the flight was confirmed and paid for. I repeated to her that I was supposed to be charged $200. She said somebody must've made a mistake and I got lucky. I was told I would receive confirmation by email. Over an hour passed and no email. Called customer service again. I was told that they didn't know why I didn't get the email and again assured me that everything was confirmed. Next morning we drove over an hour from Colorado Springs to the Denver airport. I dropped him off and went back to my hotel in Colorado Springs. About 4 hours later I got a call from my friend. There were no flights confirmed! No one had any idea what he was talking about or how that could possibly have happened. He had to wait over 5.5 hours hours in the airport beyond his scheduled departure time for a flight that he would not even have gotten had someone not canceled at the last minute.

American Airlines,2.0,Lakeva,17th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | New Orleans to Vancouver via Dallas. My husband and I had an extremely frustrating experience today. We were flying from New Orleans to Vancouver, via Dallas. The flight to Dallas was delayed. We were afraid weâ€™d miss our connection to Vancouver and were thinking of getting on a flight to Dallas with another airline, but we talked to an agent at the gate, and he kept assuring everyone that â€œall connections are fine.â€ They were anything but. We departed late and arrived late. We still had a chance of making our original flight, but when we got to the gate, it was occupied. There were many passengers who had connecting flights on the plane, including international ones. One would have thought that knowing this, the airline would try to secure an unoccupied gate (how many gates can be occupied at one time? hard to imagine that the answer is â€œallâ€). But one would be wrong. We had to stay on the plane for more than an hour. We missed the original connection (as did many other passengers). Unfortunately, there were no other flights to Vancouver from Dallas tonight. We decided to take a flight to Seattle, rent a car, and drive to Vancouver. There was a flight with American Airlines leaving shortly after we arrived. We asked the agents at the gate for the Seattle flight to put us on it, but apparently, they had no authority to do that. We went to the rebooking counter. There was a long line there. We called customer service while standing in line. They called back shortly before our turn came. We managed to get rebooked on the flight to Seattle, but when we got to the gate, the agent told us that the gates were closed. The plane was sitting there and continued to sit there for another 20 minutes, but we could only watch from outside. We are not going on vacation and have to be in Vancouver for a conference at 9 am tomorrow. If we cannot make it by then, there is no point in going at all.

Brilliant airline civilised staff at check-in and in the air great value in economy seating and superb in-flight entertainment including the ability to order drinks and snacks using the touchscreen in front of the seat.

Alitalia,1.0,G Haleka,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | On 15th December 2017 my family and I were booked on a flight from London to Johannesburg - AZ207 to Rome, connecting to Abu Dhabi and Johannesburg with Etihad Airways. At Heathrow we were checked in up to Rome and told that our onward boarding passes would be given at Rome. On arrival in Rome we were told that our agent did not book our tickets for the flight from Rome to Abu Dhabi. We were told that it was our agentâ€™s fault. We then decided to call the travel agent using roaming who confirmed that the tickets were all in order from his end. The agent advised us we need to insist on getting answers from Alitalia, to be informed what was going to happen rather than them blaming the agent for reason. This was through ticket issued all the way to Johannesburg, on Alitalia, code sharing with Etihad Airways. I then went to the desk to enquire about what was going to happen, was told to sit down and wait saying that they were busy getting the passengers to the flight. After I insisted that I wanted to know what was going to happen and that it was not fair to be told to sit without any explanation as it was clear that we were not boarding the flight, we were then informed that we will sleep in a hotel and be put on the next flight and that we donâ€™t need to worry about our luggage as we will get it in Johannesburg. It became clear that the flight was overbooked or oversubscribed. I requested to speak with the manager and to our surprise she was there, was not saying anything or giving any explanation. We waited until it was impossible for us to travel at which point we were told to go to the Alitalia desk. Onward journey tickets were arranged for the 16 of December and an accommodation was arranged for Hilton hotel. We were told that onward ticket from Paris to Johannesburg will be on the 17 December. When my wife enquired we were told that it was the only flight available and that the next one will be towards the end of the week. We left the airport around 21:45. We were informed that the meal was included in the package but on arrival at the hotel the serving of meals had ended and were informed that the meal ends at 22:00. With no vouchers to purchase food from outside, we and the children had to go to bed hungry as the hotel was far from places where we could purchase food and no microwave food or bread in cafe. In addition there was no moisturiser we could as my family have allergic skin reaction. The following day we travelled to Paris which was the different from what was booked initially by the agent. On arrival in Paris we were made aware that our onward ticket was for the following day and that there was no hotel booked for the night. We explained at the desk that it was not our fault and that we cannot sleep on the street. The manager was called and fortunately tickets were arranged for travel later that evening which was Saturday. This proves that staff lied by saying there was no available flight for us on that day. We travelled to Johannesburg and on arrival our separately booked flight to Durban was missed due to the delay in Rome. We had to purchase another ticket. As we were promised that our luggage would be in our flight, this did not happen because we only received our luggage in total after seven days.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Rome,December 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,10.0,P Nelson,14th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Long haul flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo with KLM. We paid a bit extra to have Economy Comfort seats. While Premium Economy (which is offered by other airlines) is usually a different service class with more generous seats and slightly better service, Economy Comfort seats are standard economy seats with more legroom and 50% more recline (on long haul flights). The service is exactly the same as in Economy. However, Economy Comfort seats are usually much more affordable than Premium Economy seats. We thought that the extra money was well worth it on this long flight. But the highlight of the flight was not the seat, but the excellent and very attentive service of the flight attendants.

American Airlines,7.0,Fabio Hintze,29th August 2018,"Not Verified | Frankfurt to Washington Reagan via Philadelphia. Check-In and Security were smooth and we boarded, by bus, in groups to avoid long lines. Seats were Ok, pretty standard and IFE was also standard. Nothing special but Ok. The Seat configuration was 2-4-2 and I sat on 27A. 20 minutes into the flight they had to restart the IFE because it was overheating. After 30 minutes of waiting, it could be used again. Another technical issue I noticed was that the USB ports didnÂ´t work, which was pretty annoying since I had a layover. However the IFE was pretty good. Especially there were so many good movies available that was incredible. Of course you had a moving map, TV Series etc. About 2h into the flight the crew served some food. As i sat on the back of the plane there was only 1 food option left, which was a Shepherd pie, it was delicious. It came with some salad, a bread bun and a cherry cake. The crew distributed drinks. After main course the crew dimmed the lights and we had to close our window shades. Shortly before landing the crew served either a Vanilla - or a spinach wrap with drinks. My layover in PHL was tiring but ok. At the gate there was no agent for a long time even at boarding time. So we had about 20-30 minutes delay, which was ok but I didntÂ´t knew the reason. As the flight from PHL-DCA is only 30 minutes long there was no service.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,L Heybridge,7th December 2015,"Gatwick to Seoul via Istanbul. My husband had flown with Turkish Airlines recently and had glowing reports, I was pleased to have had a similarly good experience. Seats in economy were very comfortable in all sectors and it was great to have IFE for the IST-LON routes. On our flight out, a passenger appeared to have passed away on the inbound IST-LGW flight so the flight was delayed by an hour. No information was given at LGW, but I was one of the few who might have figured out what had happened and I expect that most passengers would be more comfortable not knowing. Crew were welcoming and friendly but there were no forced smiles. It couldn't have been a great day for them but they showed utmost professionalism throughout the journey. Food was excellent, there was plenty to drink, flight was full. Not many toilets for Economy passengers, but they were well maintained and kept clean. Many of the passengers would not have made their connecting flights. I had a two hour transit window which was reduced to one hour. I walked purposefully (did not need to clear any security for this particular journey) and got to my gate as passengers were boarding. It was a long walk. I do not recommend a transit time of less than 2 hours with Turkish Airlines here. The next flight was also very full in economy but my seat was extremely comfortable and I appreciated the foot rests. Entertainment options were even more extensive than on my earlier flight. Food, again, was fantastic. I doubt any airline gives you better food in economy (better than some Business Class meals I've had). Unfortunately, about a third of the way into the flight I became ill. The crew swooped into action, called amongst the passengers for medical assistance and I had my pulse and blood pressure checked. Business class was a lot less busy than Economy and I was isolated from other passengers in a business class chair that had been turned into a bed for me. The crew kept a check on my throughout the rest of the flight and kept me hydrated. The worst of my illness passed by the time we arrived over South Korea and I took myself back to my Economy chair for landing. Thanks to the crew, I was left in a fit state to continue my journey (just needed an extra sick bag for the road). The flight back was less eventful but standards were just as high. The flight from ICN to IST was delayed by an hour. Again, I had a two hour transit window that was halved and I arrived at my gate for the IST-LHR flight as it was boarding. I really enjoyed my flights and appreciated the care and service I was given. I don't hesitate to recommend this airline but I do stress how important it is to have a long enough transit window to deal with an unforeseen delay.

When I asked a flight attendant for help they replied sharply ""We are a travel company not an entertainment company"". So I asked another flight attendant who was equally as rude. We were offered a flight with a time of only 50 minutes to connect to our next leg. This is undoable anyway we thought surely? But when our flight arrived 45 minutes late it caused all sorts of stressful complications. On return back to London from Toronto our flight was initially delayed by 4 hours but only pushing in half hour increments. So very frustrating. Short-staffed and totally unhelpful the staff were cleared stressed and it showed. We finally made it onto the plane on which we sat for 3 hours before being told to get off and come back 14 hours later as there was a problem with the plane (they had put water into a freezing cold plane which froze in the pipes expanded and burst).

Alitalia,5.0,Davide Greco,30th May 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Had six flights with Alitalia in May: Milano to Rome and Milano to Tehran via FCO one week later. My feeling is that somehow the service is better, in terms of attitude and quality, on the 50 min hop than the 4hr 30min medium haul leg. Crew on the domestic leg were welcoming and smart, I cannot say the same about the Italy to Iran part since some of them were quite grumpy and generally speaking they did not seem to enjoy their job. During the first trip, ""dinner"" was a joke: a cold snack of questionable quality and that's it. On the way back, breakfast was served right after takeoff (so around 4am). No entertainment system of any kind, not even a map and IKA-FCO no communication at all from the cockpit, not even welcome onboard. Strange boarding procedure eer in FCO: after a long walk to a remote terminal we were bussed back to the Schengen terminal and dropped in front of the plane, then we had to walk upstairs in the finger to board from there, never happened before and I do travel a lot. The same happened on the way back from Iran. Price of the ticket was very similar to Emirates and twice as much my other option (Turkish Airlines): in the end I chose AZ because of the good connecting time from/to LIN and total trip duration and, being Italian, I will give them more chances in the future since they are renewing their fleet and improving their network but after this experience I must say I am not impressed at all.",A320/E175,Business,Economy Class,LIN to IKA via FCO,2016-05-01 00:00:00,3.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,2.0,no

Emirates,6.0,Froggett Jerry,4th June 2014,"LHR-DXB-LHR with Emirates both ways on A380. Aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the A380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. Managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. Unfortunately as I've always found with Emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. Bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. Sadly this comes with a built in 'chip on the shoulder' which I've seen on every Emirates flight (more than thirty) which I've taken over the past decade or so. Slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. On the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. Food nice and plenty of it. A request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a French stewardess: ""I have more than 500 passenger today so I get it when I can"". I replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. Needless to say my wine was forgotten and I helped myself from the galley instead. Another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. On the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. Not impressive.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,Betty Pentier,22nd September 2013,I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights.

Food was excellent tasty and lots of it. Drinks were abundant although not cold was offered ice though. Toilets clean. Seats roomy. Seemed a lot of people bringing on a lot of cabin luggage!

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,1.0,I A Nikitin,15th February 2013,Moscow - Hong Kong A330-300. Both flights delayed (40 minutes and almost 2 hours respectively) which might have been a problem if I had transit. The seats are atrocious and some of them were broken. Mine were broken on both flights (headrest wouldn't stay and the tray table was squeaky and uneven). The service is more or less ok quite a lot of smiles although crew disappeared right after the meal for 8 hours. They answered the calls quickly so not really a problem. The meal was mediocre quality hit or miss catering from Hong Kong significantly better than from Moscow. They ran out of meal options on both flights pretty quickly. IFE screen was malfunctioning on both flights although after they restarted it it worked flawlessly. The system is pretty slow but I liked the movie selection. Aeroflot misinformed us twice on the gate we were arriving to which made it hard to greet us at the right terminal. They also decided that the bus is good enough to deliver the huge crowd of 300+ passengers to the terminal. Overall the experience was poor especially because of the seat pitch problem and broken seats. I must say Aeroflot is quite good on short- haul and medium-haul European flights but I would never take a long-haul with them again - the seats the delays and overall service leaves a lot to be desired and the overall feel is Aeroflot doesn't care about its customers at all.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,no
Southwest Airlines,1.0,Tom Scheers,29th August 2015,"I will never fly Southwest again. If you have a flight that connects and leaves after 2pm you will more likely than not miss the connecting flight and be stranded overnight. They offer no assistance in that event regardless of if it was their fault or not and they will never put you on another airline. They offer frequent flights between LAX and SF Bay Area making it popular with business travelers. The problem is that they routinely cancel flights 20 minutes before departure because the flight is less than half full and then send you on a later flight 2 or 3 hours later making it impossible to schedule and attend meetings the same day. Southwest went from the very best no frills airline 10 years ago to one of the top 10 worst now. I wouldn't use any airline now unless they are a direct flight.

The seat is simply great much more space than in normal Economy big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats which are top notch.

Maple Leaf Lounge was great, many seats and tables, plus free food and drink. On this Boeing 777-300, Business has a 1-2-1 Pod style seats. I found nothing wrong with them. If it was a bad thing, I couldn't sit beside my wife who I was also on this trip, so I sat behind her on the right side of the plane. To sit kinda beside is taking an isle seat but it's no window seat, plus because the pods are positioned in the pod style, being comfortable in your chair would be hard to chit chat to your traveling partner, so it's down to preference. Food was great, and the drinks were non stop. The bed was 180 degree flat bed and comfortable. There were no PJ's provided like other airlines. I am 6ft 2 and did not find it cramped and sleeping was no problem. I did read reviews in advanced that sitting in the last back seat of each section of Business, provides a bit more storage space, and it was true. So if you book in advanced and select your seat, try for these. But overall, no complaints. The flight was spacious, pods give that cozy effect.

We experienced one and a half hour delays on the day of our flight, first due to a problem by maintenance bringing the plane from the hanger to the gate, and then with baggage loading since we'd missed our scheduled boarding time. Though the pilot tried to make up time (45 minutes), American Airlines, knowing it was a flight full of connecting passengers, and that people like my husband were Platinum Executive, chose to ground us for 30 minutes because they'd made the decision to re-sell our seats after the mishap AA caused at LGA during our one and a half hour delay. It cause many of us to miss our connecting flights, which were the last flight of the day. Perhaps worse is that the pilot and flight attendants made announcements that those on our flight not connecting should remain seated because they were holding our flights. My kids and I ran 20 gates to arrive at our connecting gate 12 minutes before scheduled departure and were refused entry to the plane because the gate agent told us he had already sold our seats (we were meeting friends on the connecting flight who told us that they sold our seats 50 minutes before scheduled departure). What is worse is that we incurred many expenses by missing 24 hours of our vacation including hotel, tour group, private shuttle, plus hotel in Miami last minute during spring break. The airline has said they've officially classified it as ""Air Traffic Control"" even though the pilot repeatedly told us there was an issue getting our plane from the hanger (it didn't come from another city) and that there was a problem loading baggage. We never waited on the tarmac, except after we landed when he said AA didn't have a gate open. The airline treated us like prisoners and unethically chose to profit from our delay caused by maintenance and baggage in NY by re-selling our seats. I would not ever recommend an airline that makes decisions to screw over passengers in this manner.

It was this or cancel the holiday and pay for a flight back to Dubai until then they refused to release our bags - we paid the large amount and paid for hotels.

To my horror it was crushed to peices, I can only assume that when making the bed it was moved and the seat moved to create the bed so crushing it, the seat was not moved in any way before or after. CSD apologised prefusily, gave me her bosses email. Arrived in Doha, and connection missed to DWC as flight was late and parked on remote stand, told another 8 hours wait.

Once I finally got up to the counter the agent at my desk disappeared for another 15 minutes.

Iâ€™m not sure if she was new or wasnâ€™t trained on the system well enough because it took her a long time to rebook the ticket to the point where her supervisor had to jump in. Her supervisor told her to push me to the side and said that they would â€œdeal with me laterâ€. I waited another 20 minutes for them to get through the rest of the line.

Delta Air Lines,9.0,N Hartmann,19th January 2015,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication.

Emirates,7.0,T Mark,28th August 2014,"I recently flew from Singapore to Melbourne on a Boeing 777. On the plus side the fare was extremely cheap - $79 for a round trip ticket. The food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable - especially the selection of movies. It was an overnight flight though so I didn't use the system much. The cabin mood lighting during ""sleep"" periods was also relaxing. On the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and I could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. Admittedly I was travelling in Economy class but I have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. Unfortunately the Emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and I was only able to doze fitfully. The other thing I was disappointed with was the service. Emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events (such as meals DFS etc). I used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. However they did not do so. The service was also not the friendliest - though that could probably be due partially to the timing of the flight when the flight crew are undoubtedly tired too.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,yes

The flight attendants did not conduct proper checks to ensure passengers seats, seat belts, cabin trays and computers were in fact ready for take off or landing. The passenger briefing for take off was non-existent. The briefing for exit row passengers was worse! The flight was late and overcrowded, due to earlier delays, cancellations and overbooking.

Although I'm a Flying Blue member I do travel with other airlines so I think I can assess KLM position to other benchmarks. I am actually quite satisfied with KLM. Service is above average too often it's the passenger being rude. Food is ok not better not worse it's an airplane after all. Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good. They were a bit late on their 747s though. I will use them in the future.

I had managed to secure an upgrade via one-up (Bidding with airpoints) to move from Premium Economy to Business. Whilst I was glad of the upgrade and the ability to lie flat on what was a comfortable bed I was very disappointed with some of the soft product on board. The catering was fairly dire with a hamburger being the best option available for the evening meal. When did Air New Zealand start outsourcing its catering function to a strip-mall burger joint. Cheeses to follow were inedible and while the wine was nice, it certainly was not free flowing. Felt a little bit of a cheap experience overall. The overall cost of the meal, including what passed as a starter, cannot have been more than $10. When the airfare is around 3-4k one way on this leg, I would expect more Crew on the flight were good (as is the norm on Air NZ) just being let down by having to serve a substandard product.

As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area. Two restaurants which can be very over crowded. Restrooms are very insufficient.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,1.0,E Newalt,6th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Berlin to Erbil via Istanbul. Over two hours into the flight to Erbil when I thought we were already descending, it was announced that we couldn't land and were heading back to Istanbul on account of fog. This meant a 24 hour wait in the airport until the next flight which then was delayed another 90min. Then after everyone had boarded, two buses pull up, ""flight is cancelled"". At this point I could no longer wait, and had to fly back to Berlin. My original return would have been the day before. I spent two hours at the Turkish Airlines transfer desk with a lot of insisting and nerves to finally get this changed at the last minute to the next plane on the same day. The services there was just awful (around 1300 on Dec. 19). Initially I was told, ""everything's ok, just sit there, and we will deliver the ticket to you."" But as time went on and no one came, I had to go back to the desk and basically start from scratch, dealing with altogether 5 or six officials who spoke hardly any English and were disorganised to the point of reminding one of headless chickens. Also 2 hours of free airport wifi per week (!) is just not enough for a traveler under these circumstances.

Us and about 30/40 others. When arriving in Amsterdam we were just left to figure it out for ourselves. No guidance. Booked us on flight for the next day. Gave us a bag with a toothbrush. Told us we could not get our luggage. Put us in a hotel in the middle of no where. The KLM ground staff are rude. No one was helpful in any way. The flight staff were lovely. We were stuck in the very back of the plane. Totally cramped it was awful, but the food and staff were good though. On landing in NY we discovered one of our bags was lost. Our cab had to wait for an hour and twenty minutes while we made a lost baggage claim. Again. No help from the ground staff. No KLM staff available in lost baggage office. Got nasty Delta lady who told us it's a KLM problem. We at least got a reference number. So I just called KLM to ask when I could expect my bag. I was asked to ham up and call back as this representative's computer was down. I called back and was eventually told I could expect my back within 8 hours. Our bags were at the airport in Amsterdam for 20 hours! How can one bag not make the flight? Do not use KLM. If there is a problem they suck. And if you do decide to fly with them, upgrade your seat.

Twenty minutes into the flight (after her and another stewardess sat back and gossiped) they began to serve passengers off of the beverage cart.

She later came by and asked if we had any trash to which I responded ""How could we, you didn't offer us anything?"" She asked if I was upset and I told her that I was because I just needed some water as I had traveled all day. She said to take it up with the pilot.

Air Canada,5.0,D Martin,16th May 2016,"Our return flight from Paris started off on the wrong foot when I tried to check-in online the day before our flight. Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular.

I had gotten tied up with horrible security lines and despite checking in from home, arriving an hour early, I got to the gate at 8 minutes till. So the plane is there just sitting. No break for me. I go to customer service. The first agent said she would reroute me through Dallas but the plane was full, so I got a standby for 11hours later. I looked online and saw there were seats for another flight through Chicago and went back to request that, only arriving 3 hours late. This bored agent (not harried, there order for agents and me) said that their policy now was to when we re route through the same exact points so I was stuck on the next direct flight and could not be rerouted. But either way one of them was lying through to me. The 2nd agent refused to fly me on the much more convenient flight she just said deadpan, ""welcome to the new American Airlines."" At least I am making my flight on the much later one on a rickety old US Airways plane which are prone to frequent breakdowns, which is why I refused to fly them before. 4-6 hour delays were too common. I can always hope for a upgrade to first class, however on these planes, the first class on domestic flights is like 1985 economy deluxe. The whole experience of having to sit in an airport simply because the agents refused to help reminds me of why I could never fly US Airways. It looks like I will have to abandon American Airlines as well in favor of someone cares about its customers.

American Airlines,1.0,K Vasudha,31st May 2015,"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs.

United Airlines,1.0,Sean Terrell,28th April 2014,My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,,G Mulcahy,28th May 2015,All four flights were terrible and the disorganization and poor customer service was inexcusable. We didn't experience anything like mixed up flights or delays that lasted too long but what we did experience was bad enough. We left for an international flight that departed at 6am they had such slow kiosk and desk service that almost an entire flight of people barely made it on the plane. Kiosks weren't working the people that worked there didn't even know what was going on and were flustered. The anxiety level was high because we all thought we might miss our flight due to American Airlines awful check in service. Instead of reassuring people that the flight wasn't going to leave without 75% of it's passengers. The wifi isn't free it doesn't work half the time and they boast 'free' things to watch and it's all a scam. For as much as they charge for a flight something as little as wifi can make a huge difference. We were on an international flight and they don't even offer snacks you have to buy snacks! I had a bad cold coming home and asked the flight attendant for some cold water and hot water and tea. She rolled her eyes at me and brought me hot water and cold water and no tea. I had to ask for tea from another flight attendant who practically threw it at me. I went to the bathroom during the flight and asked a flight attendant for tissues (again I had a bad cold) she was sitting down looking at her phone and didn't even look up at me just pointed at the bathroom. On the flight home there was a group of people that were obviously traveling together and were so disruptive and rude. They were standing up in the aisle talking loudly and there was a toddler with them that kept running up and down the aisle. The flight attendants never once controlled the situation even though all the other passengers were clearly annoyed and people were saying so out loud.,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

Alitalia,1.0,E Drew,21st August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Rome to Paris. We go to the ticketing area & they have someone standing at the entrances to confirm you are in the right area, so the man checked our paper & said go right here. We stand in a long line, only to be told that we were in the wrong line!! The lady told us to go 2 rows down. (be aware that even though it says Alitalia in really huge writing on the walls behind the desks, that there are different flight names displayed on the TV's above them in small writing up in the corner of the TV). I told the lady that the guy standing right there directed me here, and that it says Alitalia right there, then she pointed out that its what's on the TV. So we go in this long line & wait. We get to the counter, & the guy starts talking to another man (which seemed to be a supervisor). We thought that maybe he was being trained so they were talking him through it, but they kept talking and laughing. We waited for awhile before I asked if there was an issue w/ our tickets. Then, he calmly says, I can't find your tickets, you'll have to go to the help desk over there. I told him we didn't have a lot of time because we had already been directed to the wrong line & that our info was right there. He said I can't help you. So we go over there & there is about 8 people in front of us & only 1 person working at that desk. I'm starting to panic at this point because I didn't want to miss our flight, we had even came really early! I tell my bf to wait inline while I go back & see if someone else could help us because it seemed like this guy didn't know what he was doing at all. I ask a man standing up front to help because we are running out of time, he directs me to the same guy that we just dealt with - I tell him we are going to miss our flight, he says you have plenty of time. I couldn't believe how he was treating me. I was so frustrated, I had to walk away. I went back to my bf & told him, he went to the kiosk to see if he could print them while I waited inline. I get up to the lady tell her he couldn't find them, she calls over to him, writes something on the paper & says go back over there & they will take you right away. (Her attitude was not any better she was rude as well!!) So I turn & rush to get my bf from the kiosk & she starts yelling at me to go back to that desk & I told her that I have to get my bf, then she says ma'am you don't have time!!! (I know we don't have time!!) So we go back to the man to get our tickets & we cut the line like she said to. He refused to help us right away, so my bf says are you guaranteeing that we will not miss our flight? He says yes & then I think he worried so he stopped helping the other people & got us our tickets. We had to run to get to our gate. we barely made it. Then the boarding lady was taking bags because there was no room & gets into it with this elderly couple because they refused to give her their bags, because they lost their bags last time. She was not understanding at all, they ended up not letting them board, instead of letting them keep their bags.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,J Lim,26th September 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR.

Qatar Airways,10.0,M Gallian,12th December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | I would like to begin this review by agreeing that Qatar by far is the best airline I have ever flown. The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if youâ€™re considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid. My favorite feature of the A350 has to be the external camera views. Qatar is simply changing the way we fly and Iâ€™ll fly with them as often as I can and you should to.",A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Doha,December 2017,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes

I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's.

Alitalia,2.0,Anita Dixon,1st January 2016,"My flight Rome to New York JFK with Alitalia was an unsatisfactory experience. I upgraded to premium economy which provided me with an aisle bulkhead seat. The legroom was great, but I have never had such a narrow airline seat in my life. I am not a huge person, but the seat was uncomfortable, worn, and too narrow. The flight left about an hour late. The food (dinner and a snack) was inedible. The dinner claimed to be lasagne and the snack was a roll up with indeterminate ingredients as a filler. I ate neither of them, nor did anyone else I saw. They were not forthcoming with water or drinks in general, but did leave some out at the rear of the plane so one could help themselves. Upon arrival at JFK, when my husband and I tried to recheck our bags through to our home city, their companion airline (Delta) told us that the flight we had booked had been cancelled for over 2 months. We were never notified (they admitted this). Our new flight was to be 5 hours later than the first, however, Alitalia had neglected to check us into the flight when we checked in in Rome, so our seats had been given away. This necessitated a desperate taxi ride across the Van Wyck in Brooklyn trying to catch a flight at LaGuardia. Alitalia provided a taxi voucher - that was all.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,M Morrison,25th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Seattle to Austin. I bought this ticket weeks ago and was given seat 21 D. When I arrived to check in the terminal would not accept my ID so I waited in line for special services for 57 minutes once I looked at my watch. Only 3, sometimes 4 staff were around to take care of a long line. When I checked in I found that there was no seat for me. The excuse being that there was a change of equipment. However since there was a 21 D on this plane what difference is that? I was offerred the back row in exchange, no regret, not sorry, so nothing. Then I was told by this astonshing gate man that If I was nice he would not lose interest in helping me.

The crew got all of their luggage though. The flight crew didn't inform us about this throughout the 3 hour flight. We came to know about this at baggage claim at Sydney airport from Sydney airport. Since I had to leave for San Jose the next day I had arranged for my bags to be delivered to my address. I found the staff at the customer service desk very unhelpful and clueless.

American Airlines,10.0,R Paterson,2nd August 2014,JFK-LAX return in F on the new A321 transcon product. American has really upped their game here. The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent. This is a first for me in over 25 years of travel. For that reason alone I fully commend this product. It's a game changer for the NY-LA market.,,,First Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,yes

Air Canada,7.0,D Hu,14th April 2015,AC63 - YVR to ICN. Flight was delayed because of malfunctioning A/C. Plane had left the gate and had to return. The total delay was over 2 hrs because of strong headwinds. The plane was immaculate as it was one of Air Canada's new B787-800s. The service was good but there was no 2nd option for meals on that flight-we were all served the same meal. Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses. Many people pressed the attendant call button or the overhead light unintentionally by resting their elbows on the buttons.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,yes

American Airlines,6.0,S Dorrel,17th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Tallahassee to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. We are the only ones in priority check in just to be ignored while employees are having a great time talking and laughing. Then the one employee checking coach class customers helped 2 other customers while we felt like fools for paying first class prices. All was well and the 1st class cabin was comparable to competitors. Food was a disgrace. Service was good. White wine was served warm with no apologies. On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes.

You can not check In online under basic economy unless you check luggage for $30 each flight. This policy makes for long lines at the ticketing counter due to those who use to not check bags as a time saver. The long lines at the ticketing counter makes it so United does not have enough manpower to check in customers that use to bypass the line causing new added congestion.

Alitalia,1.0,J Manning,20th October 2014,October 10th from Rome to Toronto. We did not choose to fly this airline as we had bought tickets from British Airways however due to flight delays British Airways arranged for us to fly on Alitalia for the first leg of our trip. We were told incorrect information regarding seat availability and flight details from the Alitalia representative upon check-in and boarding the plane was a largely unorganized process which took well over one hour to complete. The plane was older (tube televisions down the center of the plane instead of seat-back screens) the cleanliness of the seats was sub-par and the sink in the toilet was clogged for the duration of the trip. For the first half of the flight the service on board was mediocre but acceptable however once dinner was served the service became non-existent. For 4 to 5 hours (on a 9 hour flight) the flight attendants hung out at the back of the plane and were deliberately ignoring the call button. If any passengers wanted a drink they were required to walk to the back of the plane and pour it themselves all while the flight attendants sat around talking and completely ignoring anything outside of their conversation. This expectation of self service is very inconvenient when someone with anything but an aisle seat would like a glass of water. I also wondered what passengers who require mobility assistance do in this situation? Flight attendants ignoring their passengers for half of an international flight is completely unacceptable.

Lufthansa,2.0,J Tydeman,23rd January 2015,Flew to and from Sao Paulo via Frankfurt. Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow even though by their own admission they have now arrived on a later flight.

The beef and the pasta were much tastier dishes. Thankfully fresh salad/balsamic dressing has been part of the business meal for a few years. Tasty desserts/cheese plates ensure that no one will starve. The pods are a comfortable way to travel and we always manage to have 4-5 hours of sleep.

Then the gate lady told me my bag is not delivered yet and they can't let me board. I then ran to the customer service of Air Canada.

Outgoing leg from Syracuse to Barbados via JFK was uneventful except they transposed my last and middle names on the reservation, causing a slight delay in boarding at JFK.

However, at 3:42 AM on morning of departure from BGI (Saturday 1/19), I received an email and text that the BOS-SYR leg of my return trip had been delayed 2 whole dats. This was due to anticipated winter weather (Winter Storm â€œHarper,â€ how I hate these stupid names). No way to reach anyone on the phone (hung up after 45 minutes on hold). At BGI, I pleaded to be stuck there instead of frigid Boston, but they could not accommodate me until Wednesday 1/23 (and with a fee despite â€œfee waiverâ€). My emailed complaints did get me a $300 credit (half of total airfare). Cluster on Monday 1/21 as 10:50 PM BOS-SYR flight was repeatedly delayed until finally being canceled at 2:24 AM. Due to numerous delayed/canceled B6 flights, there was a mad rush for transportation, meaning no Ubers and an over-an-hour wait in single-digit cold for cabs. Despite cancellation being due to crew timeout, ground staff still termed it a weather delay and offered no compensation beyond refunds.

The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent.

I agreed (I was originally sitting in a bulkhead seat for the extra legroom), and I was upgraded to Premium Economy!

Lufthansa,4.0,Derek Ardron,22nd February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | New York JFK to Frankfurt. My wife and I were seated in 32E/F (middle of centre 4 seating with our backs up against the toilets and galley). There was no way of reclining our seats and very little leg room. This was bad enough for a 7.5 hour flight but as soon as we were in the air the passengers in front of us reclined their seats, the backs of their seats came back to very near our faces. Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. This happened again later on when the need was desperate. Still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down. While this was going on the toilets further up the plane were doing business as usual.

American Airlines,5.0,K Diaz,23rd June 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | AA got me to Europe and back to the US safely. That is about all I can say that's positive. I have flown this airline for over 30 years and they seem to be going downhill in on-time departures, comfort, and service. On my trip from DFW to Paris and the return from Rome, the service was the most apparently lacking. On the outbound they kept announcing another 30 minute delay(mechanical problem in the interior) every half hour for a total 3 hour delay. The ground crew was heard saying they did not have enough maintenance people working on a Sunday afternoon. The dinner service once onboard was rushed and unpleasant and I chalked it up to the late take off. Not so, because the service from the flight attendants on the return trip was just as shabby. FA were unfriendly, unhelpful, and at times rude or condescending towards passengers. They acted as if they did not want to be there doing this job. I was in the new Premium Economy cabin and paid a lot more than an economy fare for my ticket. I feel the higher cost should include better service, not just a bigger seat. The new Premium Economy passengers had to go sometimes to the very back of the plane and through the galley to use a vacant lavatory. Forget stretching your legs on a long flight by walking to the back as the aisles are so narrow in the Main Cabin one can not avoid bumping seated passengers.There was no offer of refills on the free alcohol drinks. Any question or request was met with an attitude that the FA could not be bothered. I could see that this job may not be the most glamorous, but if you can't or won't do the job, then retire so that someone with a better attitude could take your place.

A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no

The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight.

But they could only offer me yet another Non-Meat Pasta Meal because the other one offered was a Fish Meal which I do not eat at all.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,9.0,B Valkier,11th January 2012,Paid a low price for flight Paris-Tokyo (with a stopover at Moscow). First leg Paris-Moscow was very good. A new airbus with comfortable seats helpful and smiling staff full bar service and good food. No flight entertainment. Transfer at SVO was ok. Moscow-Tokyo was not delayed. While food and onboard staff were nice the plane a Boeing 767 was falling apart. Flight entertainment was a Russian dubbed copy of Home Alone in one of the few screens that would pop out here and there. The second leg was a brand new A330 with new seats individual screens more than 50 films to choose from full bar service and great food. Staff were friendly and English speaking.

Never have I experienced such delays for no apparent reason other than the flight was late to begin with - they boarded us two hrs late, as soon as the prior flight de boarded. Bathrooms filthy, no beverage service, other than warm water. After boarding they notified us that we would be sitting in the plane for another two hours. Not a full flight so we found some seats to stretch out in, as soon as I got comfortable in my new seat I was informed that I had to relocate to my original cell of torture - again, for no apparent reason.

Delta Air Lines,2.0,W Rongu,14th April 2015,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.,,,Business Class,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,no
Qatar Airways,6.0,R Manter,3rd August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Stockholm to Bangkok via Doha. Check-in operated by SAS staff at Stockholm opens 3hrs before, a little slow as they validate visas and pass people along to pay extra baggage where applicable, but nothing worryingly so - all outsourced check-in is the same in my experience. Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour. Meals were good, staff were great - very friendly, toilets were always clean. However I've cancelled my return flights in April 2018 taking the $200 on tax refund and putting it towards another airline.

When asked whether I will be able to make the connection was told ""you will, all of our flights are late today"". Rome airport is a complete nightmare and that alone is a reason for not flying Alitalia again. On the way back however it was a different story. Flight assistants were very friendly and helpful and the food while nothing to write home about was much better. Flights departed on time and landed earlier than expected.

Emirates,3.0,Bart Stam,5th January 2016,"Mauritius to Dusseldorf via Dubai. The advantage of Emirates are quite modern aircraft with spacious seats, and attractive pricing for business class. The disadvantage is that you'll have an extra stop-over at Dubai. It looks like that Emirates puts more emphasis on languages spoken onboard by its crew, than the quality of their job performance. On two out of four flights on this vacation, I found that the crew assigned to my section were very professional. The other two flights the crew were sloppy or inadequately trained. On one flight I had to move to another seat because the headrest was broken. (I am quite tall person, and therefore a headrest that is so loose that it immediately drops to the lowest position, is not acceptable for me). When moving to an empty seat a stewardess told me that she had received several reports of seat problems on that flight. Because of the quality of the customer service of Emirates, my overall rating is low. It took one week to get a standard answer to one of the two issues I reported. This standard answer was obvious not applicable to my situation. I then asked for a relevant answer on both issue, but after an month I haven't received any answer at all.

Air Canada,7.0,Chaoxian Tian,16th June 2015,"Flew from Vancouver YVR to Sydney NS YQY via Montreal YUL and Halifax YHZ. First segment from YVR to YUL was an overnight flight on an A320. Received help from YVR ground crew since this was my first air travel in Canada. The flight took off and landed on time. Cabin crew on board was good at communication and drinks were served. However no meal was served for a 5-hr flight, which was to my surprise (and then I knew that AC simply does not do that on domestic flights no matter short-haul or long-haul). En-route entertainment system was a nice touch and there were programmes for different ages and culture. Seat was not an issue since I was seated in an exit row. Second segment from YUL to YHZ was on an E190, which was one of the most comfortable single-aisle aircraft in my opinion. Had entertainment system as well. Also, only drinks were served. This time I was seated in a normal row and the seat pitch was just enough to accomodate myself (6'2"" and 240lbs). Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks. Seat pitch was even tighter this time but since the seat cushion was shortened, there was still enough room to seat myself.

I can always find a normal price for the flight, the aircrafts are clean, the staff is so polite and welcoming and the snacks always fresh and tasty. In the Prague airport, the service is as it should be always. Mine only complaints have to do with the airport in Athens, as always are unnecessary delays. The flight to Prague is not using a gateway to the aircraft, but a bus. There is still a priority to Gold and Silver members, for no reason in that case, since everyone will get on a bus. Also, another thing that I had complained in the past in the company's support contact form, is about other's passenger's cabin luggage, which in many are too big in comparison with the proper aircraft cabin luggage. As a result, most of the times, there is an announcement for giving cabin luggage without extra cost in order to be stored in the cargo compartment of the plane.

Emirates,4.0,J Stafford,16th February 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left.

Air New Zealand,10.0,Tennant Vicki,14th September 2014,Over the past few months I have done long haul return flights in Premium Economy on Qantas Cathay and British Airways and Business Class on Singapore Airlines. I was flying from Sydney to San Francisco (via Auckland and LA) and the flight segment yesterday in Air New Zealand Premium Economy (space seats) from Auckland to Los Angeles was vastly better than all the other airline's Premium Economy. The seats are wonderfully designed spacious and comfortable with ample surrounding space. I loved the large pillow and even got a second one for extra comfort. In fact (even though the seats don't lie flat) the whole premium economy cabin with mood lighting and great layout looked better than the business class cabin. The toilet area was huge always spotless and I loved the whimsical 'bookcase'! The amenity pack was welcome with Clarins creams and cute stripy socks and eye mask with funny message on it. The entertainment selection (with noise cancelling headphones) was huge - really something for everyone - and a big screen with multiple angles for comfortable viewing. The service from 2 male flight attendants was outstanding and the meals were absolutely delicious by any (not just airline) standard. I think the food is the same as in Business Class - for dinner I had figs olives and proscuiito as a starter salmon in a crust with bean puree and spinach lemon tart camomile tea and chocolates (with sparkling wine and NZ Shiraz) breakfast was muesli with yoghurt cheese and mushroom omelette with tomato concasse coffee etc. I have often flown business and first class on other airlines - I can honestly say that if I could fly to all the destination I need to go on Air NZ Premium Economy (space seats) it would always be my first choice.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,T Lovett,29th May 2015,LAX-SJO DL1388 1 May 2015. SJO-LAX DL1396 11 May 2015. We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have layflat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that layflat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight even though some of it was across the Pacific Ocean. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. Flight safety is serious business. A safety briefing by a cabin attendant reinforces that. Downplay it with a cartoon gives the impression that its all one big joke. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It comprised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40 min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class.

Terminal F at SVO is crowded and inconvenient. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food was served twice good choice tasty meals. Entertainment system is very good. Blankets and earphones were given to all the passengers. Seat comfort was very poor to me. Seats are narrow with surprisingly little legroom.

United Airlines,1.0,D Grewton,20th May 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Most recently I was flying from Rome to Kansas City, via Turkish Airlines and United. Connecting through Chicago, my flights switched to United from Turkish Airlines. Turkish Airlines was able to ensure my bags made it from Rome to Istanbul to Chicago all in one piece despite multiple delays and a very long layover. United lost my bag in the 1 hours flight from Chicago to Kansas City. At the baggage claim the gentlemen said it was still in Chicago and would be delivered the next day. It was not. Unfortunately, they were still unable to recover my luggage as of 3 days after landing, forcing me essentially try to make excuses for not having the promised items at the meeting with my clients. I filed additional claims for my luggage twice, neither of which were even responded to. 4 days later, I called again, and was told my luggage was simply lost. I unchecked rechecked the bag in Chicago after arriving from an international flight, and they somehow lost the bag. Trying to get United to cover the costs of what was lost is proving to be even more nightmarish. The quality of service is astounding awful. I have had delayed bags before with United, but now having them simply lose my bag on such a short flight, and then fight me at every step when trying to claim the bag is shockingly despicable. If I would have known my Turkish Airlines flight was using United for the last leg, I would have never bought the ticket, as United is generally a terrible airline anyways for constant delays, uncomfortable seats, and delaying my baggage constantly. But this has trumped all other experiences regarding terrible care and costing me literal thousands of dollars for their negligence.",,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Kansas City,2017-05-01 00:00:00,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

I explained that my bag was located the night before and should of already been delivered to me. They then told me I could go ahead and spend $150 to replace the items in my bag while they got this sorted out. I thought, well at least they are trying to do right by me.

The welcome on the plane is expeditious, the smiles rare. We had two hostesses, one obviously beginner, shy to the point of not being able to look in the eyes while talking to us, and faster than lightning: the tablecloths are literally thrown on the shelves, the drinks served without presentation, she ran most of the time like most hostesses. The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points: the quality of the wines, including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device ""wifi"" control of audiovisual instruments did not work, despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced, pleasant and smiling, that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is non-existent in Phuket, for reasons never explained, and the car provided to Dubai was the worst, dented on its flank must, while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars, having two separate tickets.

Emirates,3.0,Denis Teulon,9th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that â€œComputer saysâ€ itâ€™s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is... My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard.

On top of that they wanted us to fly out the next morning to FL then catch a flight from FL back to JFK. I booked a non stop ticket and we wanted to get home. So we had to fly to FL and then go back to JFK the same day. Did not get in til 12:30 and got home at 2 AM. Called them up to see what they can do for us and they ended up giving us 175 per person credit. That will expire in 365 days and we have to fly with them again. This really did put a bad taste in my mouth after flying with them for so long. I donâ€™t think I would ever fly with them again. They can take the 175 credit and eat it. All the hours I spent at the airport and had to do a layover to get home and I get 175 back. Total joke! I guess JetBlue does not care about customer service.

United Airlines,1.0,Steve Shanahan,16th January 2016,"Philadelphia to San Francisco, and United Airlines boarding system is archaic and ridiculous. Don't pick an aisle seat or you will end up getting on last and there will be no overhead space for your bag. When I was boarding, the Group 3, 4 and 5 lines were lined up for a long time since no one pays attention to this system knowing that they're going to get screwed if they try to get a bag in the overhead. I was a 5 and when our turn came, they suddenly announced that everyone (1/5 of the passengers) had to check their carry on bags at the counter because there was no overhead space available which caused complete chaos. After going through security and always getting x-rayed and patted down for no reason, facing this boarding madness feels like torture not to mention the long flight ahead. I did pay for the extra leg room but you get no priority boarding for that - you're just like the people who pay nothing extra. The crew look miserable and I can't say I blame them and the passengers seem sullen and depressed after the regimen they've been through. If companies like United Airlines want to encourage repeat business, they're going to have to realize that you can't treat people like animals and sometimes you might want to give them something to comfort their stress in flying - not even peanuts - they're so cheap.

American Airlines,5.0,N Roper,23rd April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Seattle to Buenos Aires via Dallas Ft Worth. I fly regularly to Argentina from the US. I purchase First Class tickets, typically in the region of $5-6000 USD for a return trip. I have to say that AA First Class is not a patch on other international carriers. My most recent trip, the hard product was okay, the seat was comfortable and that was about it. The AVOD system is old, slow, low resolution with a tiny screen. The choice of movies is very limited. Even bearing that in mind, this can be made up for in service. I found the flight crew to be indifferent, the service below average and the attitude seemed to be we were a constant inconvenience preventing them from being able to get back to the socializing at the front of the cabin. I am a very, very low maintenance flyer, but I found even the basics were missed. On the outbound leg, I wasn't even offered a drink at boarding! This is in International First Class. Food choices weren't available from the menu (I was in 2J) and I get the distinct impression that most people on the flight were on FF upgrades as opposed to paying pax. On the return flight, an AA employee (non flight crew) was sitting across from me - he was attentively taken care of, chatted to, given menus/drinks/turn down etc. The Airline is in trouble when it takes care of employees over premium passengers paying thousands of dollars for a seat. Aircraft is getting really old, this was a B777-200, and the interior was probably late 90's or early 2000's. Other than the large seats, everything was to a lower fit, finish and equipment level than an Alaska B737 in economy! There is not excuse for this, in fact, the AA A320 on the connecting flight to Seattle was way better with USB ports, power and a really nice big hi res AVOD system. Delta flies old airplanes too, but their interiors are bang up to date. There was not even a standard 110V power outlet - in First Class! It's hard to be a repeat customer, AA has been good in the past, but they are now firmly in the United Airlines category for me, they don't seem to be too bothered about earning my dollars.

On all three tickets and on two separate occasions they changed the flights and added a ten hour layover. They said that they would fix it by asking me to leave a day later. I booked through Expedia and they would not help. I was on the phone with Expedia and Aeromexico for at least two hours. They did offer a refund but by this time all the fares were at least $250 more. I had to cancel all three tickets and rebuy on other airlines at an extra cost of $750!

Flight delayed around 20 mins due to late arrival of the inbound flight. As it was a day flight I noticed how grubby the cabin was. Very tired and worn out plane.

American Airlines,2.0,A Goddard,17th March 2015,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!,,,Economy Class,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,no

Good selection of food and drinks. Plenty of IFE (about 50 movies to choose from and on-demand even on the short-haul sector). Most staff didn't speak too much English but perfectly fine to get the job done. The only letdown was Moscow airport.

United Airlines,1.0,Olivia LaGoy-Weltz,6th October 2015,"I have done 10+ flights this summer many of which have been on United Airlines. Every time I fly it's with the same roller board and the same boot bag for my tall boots (I train horses). Both items are always carried on no problem, the one goes over head and the boots under the seat - except tonight. I was stopped before going through security and told my roller bag was too big. I went to their kiosk across from security where it tuned out the Mobile boarding pass scanner wasn't working so he entered my info twice manually before deciding his system didn't work and I had to go to the desk. Annoyed I went around the corner and moved the jacket into my boot bag so the suitcase would fit in their bin. I went back to security where they didn't even ask to check the size of my bag but then told me my boot bag was too big. Keep in my my friend had gone through security with the same boot bag with her helmet attached to it not 5 minutes before and had not been stopped. Both the manager from United Airlines was incredibly rude as was the security staff. The manager threatened to not let me on the flight - all this over bags that easily fit on the flight and that had both been carried on all of my other United flights including the one to CA 3 days earlier. United is a highly short sighted company with a very poor customer service vision and corporate culture. They don't realize that by ruining a clients experience before they even get on the flight they breed a culture of rudeness. I am normally a model passenger - kind to other passengers, nice to the flight attendants, complimentary to the pilots - after this I have no reason to look at a United Airlines staff member in the eye, clear my trays from the security line, or engage in any kind of pleasantries.

Qatar Airways,8.0,H Simpson,4th July 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, Â£1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.","A380, A320",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AUH to LHR via DOH,July 2016,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,yes

We decided to splurge on our return Sydney- Auckland flight and pay the extra for a works deluxe seat. At $450 it was nearly three times the cost of our outbound no food no bags flight with Virgin. Never again! The Premium check-in queue turned out to be slower than the 'normal' queues. The Sydney lounge is utterly awful worn out furniture (holes in the arms of chair I sat in) and dreadful food. Yes the drinks are free but t's a huge price to pay for a couple of G&Ts. Yes having a guaranteed spare seat beside us was good but we had that on our cheap Virgin flight out. The food was very lack- lustre and you had to really make an effort to get a second drink.

For example there was a crying infant who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child although not taken by the offered customer her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers.

I was not impressed by the seat comfort but I had 4 seats to myself so this was very pleasant. The entertainment was average with lots of old films which I enjoyed but these could have been better structured and novel. I thought the cabin decor did not look modern. Staff were attentive and pleasant. The flight to Denpasar was crowded in a 777 which had seen better days. No seats free and staff taxed to look after us. No structure of meals was announced so was waiting for food which never came. Video screens were small and I was the lucky one who had the entertainment box at their feet - very uncomfortable. In conclusion, Emirates disappointed. As somebody said, Dubai has got out of control as a hub and standards have slipped. If Emirates want to stay on top, they need to work harder and realise if one takes the eye off the ball, standards slip fast. Just about to enjoy 14 more hours of Emirates.",Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Dublin to Denpasar via Dubai,September 2017,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,no

The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience.

Southwest Airlines,4.0,R Sattler,20th May 2014,I am thinking of taking a different airline for my future travels. The major reason I had chosen Southwest was the 2 free checked bags but on this last trip there was more damage to the contents of the bags then a fee would have cost me. Since I am pregnant and was tired after my flight I did not check my second bag until the next day and that is when I found the broken items. The bag did not seem damaged and the items where wrapped in towels and other clothes. Customer service said they could not do anything about it though since I did not report it within four hours.

The IFE is an improvement over the previous version but the content was a let down as the programming had not been updated with the current month's movies.

I had a boarding pass in hand as I went through the long (25-30 min) security line at DFW. When we arrived at the security desk, the TSA officer scanned my boarding pass and told me it was ""invalid."" We then tried to scan it from my wife's smart phone in case it was a printer error. Still invalid. I was told to exit the security line and go to an AA kiosk to print another boarding pass. Well, the reserved seat with my name on it was no longer available, so I was forced to make another seat selection. In addition, I was forced to pay an extra $6-7 for the seat. Since I really wanted to join my family for our spring break vacation, and did not wish to miss my flight, I went ahead and bought the new seat. Fortunately the TSA officer allowed me back to the front of the line and I was able to join my family in the terminal, narrowly making the flight. The whole thing seemed like an outrage, even by AA's deplorable standards.

The button to get attention means nothing as they either keep switching it off at the back or ignore it. The attendants were a bit rude when asking for more alcoholic beverages. Food was average.

American Airlines,1.0,Sarah Hakola,18th December 2016,"New York JFK to Akronâ€“Canton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration. The lack of support and concern for their passengers is ridiculous and I will never fly AA again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to CAK via CLT,December 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

Lufthansa,2.0,K Roberts,3rd November 2014,Flight out of Krakow to Munich cancelled due to heavy fog. Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service.

Have to say that flying NZ is a predominantly pleasant experience with real food served restaurant style a fantastic lie flat bed (even in the old planes) and great service from experienced cabin crew. So in the air great but on the ground they leave a lot to be desired. The self serve check in at MEL is a joke. It is not a premium service and you need to manually check that your baggage is tagged priority. AKL boarding is a schmozzle with very small gates and loads of passengers.

I was very pleased on my outbound flight to find them just the same and more legroom than I get on international flights. But what made this trip better is that I needed a change in my (non-changeable) flight due to a family emergency and was pretty distraught on the phone. The person assisting me was professional and comforting and took care of getting me on the best flight to get me home, and made a hard trip far far easier.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Benjamin Lawrence,18th December 2014,Flew NRT-DOH-JNB return. The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box.

Despite booking 5 months ago, I was put on standby due to overbooking for my flight from Santiago to Dallas then Hong Kong. Passengers from a flight to Miami, cancelled only that day, were given seats ahead of me! After a harrowing 3 hour wait, I was given one of the last seats just as the plane commenced boarding. Check in staff were very very slow. Not sure what the problem was but it took an hour for me to reach the front of a 10 person queue with 3 counters open. Onboard staff were also quite rude - they appear to hate their jobs and certainly the passengers! Abrupt, unresponsive.

I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class.

Air Canada,3.0,R Leane,31st December 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | I took this flight from Vancouver to San Diego with my husband and son on Dec 28th. The flight was scheduled from 8pm - 11pm. 7:30 PM - Upon arrival at the departure gate we were informed the plane was delayed for an unspecified period of time. 8:40 PM - We boarded 40 mins late. My family all had only carry on bags, which we quickly realized would not fit in the overhead compartments - along with a many other passengers. Our bags were taken from us to be placed under the plane, and would have to retrieved via the carousel in San Diego. It seemed odd that all the flight staff watched us board with bags they knew would not fit in the plane? The overhead compartments were broken and duct taped in several places on the plane. One gentlemen even remarked that he thought the front window of the plane was duct taped. 9:20 - Takeoff The plane seemed very old and in dire cosmetic disrepair. The flight staff were friendly. They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog. Everyone was obviously disappointed and also confused because it didn't appear foggy. Once in LA we sat in a deserted area of the airport hoping to be accepted for deplaning. Several announcements were made to try and appease our frustrations but the pilot himself seemed utterly defeated. He mentioned that he ""we shouldn't worry, because they were already assured we wouldn't have to return to Vancouver."" We were just sitting there on the tarmac waiting for something to happen. At one point there was supposed to be a bus coming to get us and staff to help accommodate our various scenarios. 1:30 AM - We were able to utilize a deplaning corridor (our plane was too small to fit against the tunnel opening, so we walked down the stairs of the plane and up into the terminal via a second set. Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options. We were also told the reason the plane didn't land in San Diego was because the in flight crew had worked 12 hours and wanted out of the air and didn't want to circle to wait to land. We checked the flight status at San Diego airport and it appeared all other flights were landing. 2:00 AM - Air Canada staffers advised those of us wishing to leave to submit car rental vouchers to Air Canada, those in need of boarding stayed back. I will try this but some other folks with previous experiences of this nature didn't seem hopeful that we would be reimbursed. I will remain hopeful. We rented a car for $100 from Avis. 4:00 AM - We arrived at Hotel in San Diego. My parents were to arrive in San Diego today to meet us on the same Air Canada flight 8 pm - 11pm. After our experience yesterday, I was very worried for them. Rightfully so, the flight was cancelled right at 8:00 PM ""no pilot"".

After over an hour's wait a supervisor got back to me and said - sorry nothing we can do - flight is canceled due to weather. I asked where was the weather problem. As she was saying that there is a lot of rain in NYC I was looking at the weather.com report that reported partly sunny skies at JFK.

Turkish Airlines,10.0,Adam Wang,17th March 2014,London-Istanbul-Beijing Economy class. I have to say this is the best economy class I have experienced. For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways.

We were supposed to leave at 8:10 am - after delay after delay we boarded the plane around 2:30pm after sitting in the airport for 8 hours. We got in the sky and about 2 hours into our travel. There was an announcement from the captain explaining that we have to fasten our seatbelts immediately because we would have to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers because they were low on fuel. Im not quite sure why the airplane would be low on fuel about 2 hours into the short trip! That is absolutely absurd! Shortly after that there was another announcement from one of the flight attendants stating that she knows we all have questions and she does not have the answers to in a very frantic voice putting us all In a very scared state. Im not quite sure what she meant by that because the answer was to get more fuel which seemed like an absolute lie or cover up of some sort. Once we finally landed in Fort Myers me and the 4 other people that I was with the 3 that were on the reservation with me, and a friend from another reservation demanded to get off of the plane because we felt unsafe along with some other people that wanted off of the plane. We were told that we were not allowed off of the plane. Not only were we afraid for our lives because of the low fuel incident, we felt as though we were being held hostage. The captain and other workers were extremely rude to us and made us feel very uneasy! They even told us we are on our own when we got off of the plane after ripping up our tickets. After telling us that we were not allowed off of the plane and to take our seats we all demanded to get off. Finally, they let us off of the plane snatched our tickets and ripped them up. We had to pay for a rental car to get to the final destination Miami and drive for about 3 hours due to thunderstorms. We did not reach our destination until after 10:30pm. This has been a disaster! This was my first flight and not sure that I will be getting on another plane again. Our 2-3 hr flight turned into a 16.5 hour trip, more money spent on a rental, afraid for our lives, and an entire day lost! Our way home was on a Frontier airline and took us 2 hours and 5 minutes.!

Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,P Hamoulady,1st April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Boston to Tehran via Istanbul. I had one of my worst experience (if not the worst) with Turkish Airlines. I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with. The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing.

Southwest Airlines,3.0,LaShun Smith,24th July 2015,"I'm very upset that Southwest has chosen to implement this new boarding system. I'm flying with my 10y/o daughter. I checked in online and received what I thought were seat numbers. No, it was a boarding position. The flight was full and all the ""A boarding positions"" were taken so I couldn't even pay the extra $80 to increase the chances of my child sitting with me on the flight! I don't care where I sit on the plane, however, when I'm traveling with my 10 y/o daughter or any family, it's nice to sit with them. I would rather fly with an airline that assign seats upon check-in than to roll the dice to see if I can sit with my child. My first bag is free but to sit next to my child is $40 per ticket.

At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.

After canceling our flight at 1 am for reasons not valid since they said it was due to weather but the gate across the hall from us departed to Miami half an hour after and our plane was sitting there the entire time, nobody cared to give us assistance with hotel, and in order to book another flight home which happened to be on my birthday, we had to wait 4 and a half hours on hold, and were able to get on a flight for 2 days later. The worst part is that once we arrive at the ticket counter after all we went through they make a big deal about 4 pounds over weight of my luggage and we purchased the main cabin seats so we can be more comfortable and guess what?

The agent directed us to priority screening and The Admiral Lounge to relax in while waiting for our flight. Once we got to the lounge they tried to charge us $50 per person for lounge access. Normally with a first class ticket lounge access is part of that cost on all the other airlines we travel with. Not with American Airlines.

United Airlines,2.0,R Pecher,27th October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago. United used to be a good airline company. In the past, if youâ€™d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, thatâ€™s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). Iâ€™m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, itâ€™s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage Iâ€™ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply canâ€™t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldnâ€™t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc. I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called â€œdeveloping countriesâ€ are better than United Airlines and treat their customers better than they do. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, From now on, I am going to make sure of one thing: to only put my feet on United Airlines planes if I have absolutely no other choice.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago,October 2017,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no

For my trip from Prague to Moscow, March 14th, I had to make a quick stop in Amsterdam and therefore booked KL1356/KL3178 flights. However, before the flight, I got informed that Amsterdam lag will be operated by Transavia. As a consequence, no comfortable seats available. Such a change makes a big difference, given ridiculously small seat pitch at Transavia. If you value a basic level of comfort, you would avoid Transavia. Unfortunately, I was given no choice. During my online check-in at KLM websites I was also invited to â€œchoose seat for freeâ€. Just to learn, such a choice is in fact not available for me, given Moscow lag is operated by Aeroflot. Puzzled, I asked why it cannot be done given both KLM and Aeroflot are members of SkyTeam alliance. I learned that this is due to the fact that the respective systems are not interconnected as yet and ""choose your seat"" therefore no option. Expression ""as yet"" sounds real pathetic, given KLM is member of SkyTeam for already 14 years and Aeroflot for 12 years. Management of Sky Alliance must be real preoccupied by other issues if there was no time to implement such a simple feature like seat selection. In a summary, my KLM flight was no KLM flight.

This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level!

American Airlines,1.0,P Meares,19th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Toronto via Charlotte. Due to an ice storm in Toronto, my connecting flight from Charlotte to Toronto was canceled (which I understood, and I support the airline in wanting to keep passengers safe). I admit that I was frustrated and worried because I was having trouble connecting to the CLT wi-fi to let my family know I was stranded (and I had never been stranded before), but even so, the lack of sympathy from the American Airlines staff was just staggering. The staff at the service desk talked more to each other than they did to me, and eventually handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-888 number for Travelassist and told me to go call the number. No empathy, no vouchers for food or shelter to help me along. And when I called the Travelassist number, they told me that all the hotels were booked and to call back in 2 hours to see if anything had come available (which is just as well, because I was so tired I gave up and booked a hotel through Expedia, and later found out that Expedia beat the ""distressed passenger rates"" AA secured by $15 per night!) When I got to the baggage claim to grab the bag I'd checked, it wasn't there, and when I asked the AA rep at the desk about it, he said that it could take 1-2 hours, and ""if my bag didn't show up in 2 hours, come back."" After an hour or so, my bag finally showed up. When I caught my rescheduled flight 2 days later, the AA staff at O'Hare were just as rude as the ones at CLT! I was not able to check in online for my connection, and only wanted someone to confirm whether I would be flying out that day, as I had a family member in Toronto waiting to pick me up and would have to message that person if I was delayed. When I went up to the desk at my gate, there was no-one there, but a young AA staff member was hovering nearby, so I asked him if he could help me. I was abruptly told by an AA crew member behind me that I had to wait for the gate attendants to show up. When they did, I went up to them to ask if they could help me, and was rudely told by the attendants (whose nametags were completely hidden by their scarves) to come back when they'd finished boarding the current flight. Other than the stewardess who grumpily loaned me a pen so I could complete my customs form, there wasn't a single American Airlines staff member I encountered who could be described as helpful, and none of them were kind or pleasant. I was a stranded student who had chosen AA so that I could come home from an academic conference a day early to save $350. Now, all the money I saved by choosing AA is gone because I received no vouchers, no guidance, no sympathy and no help. My first experience with American Airlines, which spanned multiple airports, showed me how rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service people can be. And based on most of the other reviews on this site, I'm not alone in that discovery. I just wish I'd checked reviews before trying to save money - this was a painful and costly lesson to learn the hard way.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Toronto via Charlotte,April 2018,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no

United Airlines,2.0,M LaPrairie,5th December 2016,"The Polaris disaster with United Airlines. Washington IAD to Zurich on a 767-400ER. Same seat as before, but with a bunch more stuff, including a â€œpolar bearâ€ teddy bear, so thereâ€™s no space to put anything. Of course, having a teddy bear didnâ€™t guarantee that Iâ€™d have a menu (which I had to ask for) nor an amenity kit with ear plugs - which I sorely needed because the guy beside me started to snore loudly just after takeoff. Once the bell indicated that the crew could get out of their seats and start the service, I used the FA call button to ask for an amenity kit to get some ear plugs. The FA working in my section came to me and said that I should not to use the call button because it was loud and would disturb other passengers. His telling me that woke up the guy beside me. So much for not disturbing other passengers. I was amazed and annoyed. Iâ€™ve never been told in a premium cabin on any carrier not to use the call button. Why did I have to use the call button? I got on board and had no menu, no amenity kit yet somehow I had a teddy bear, pillow, two blankets and a rude flight attendant who told me to just signal him when heâ€™s in the aisle. I did that and got an arms crossed â€œwhat would you likeâ€ rude stare. The movie selection consisted of exactly six movies. My tray table would not come out, so I had to leave my seat while the same FA who told me not to use my call button yanked on it to the point where it finally ejected from its slot, but, in the process, toppled over my drink. Now a piece of the siding underneath where the table is stowed is unhinged and flapping loosely. Whoâ€™s got a piece of tape? To top it off, my appetizer was frozen (including the salad) and the bread was cold and stale. Good luck, UA, with Polaris. So far, not impressed. Same miserable UA crew with bad attitudes (although the Cabin Service Director was polite and apologetic when I told him what his colleague had said to me about the call button). This has been a rude awakening after regularly flying Qatar Airways for the last two years.

Air New Zealand,8.0,Jorge Silva,4th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew from Auckland to Christchurch. Flying with Air New Zealand on a domestic route is a low cost experience. You really have to add - when you buy the ticket online - any baggage to put in the hold. They will be very strict about the maximum weight (23kg wich is better then other airlines). Also be aware that carry-on lugagge really has to fit into grill at the boarding gate. Seats are not very spacious but is ok for such a flight. Just cookies and water are served. Very good creative emergency exits movie (one of the best I have seen). This cabin crew were the most clumsy I have seen, particulary the purser that never seemed to know when to show the movies, when to serve the candies, etc..",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Christchurch,February 2017,3.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,4.0,yes

Lufthansa,2.0,M Petr,20th November 2014,"As LH Senator I have repeatedly booked a seat for my flights and repeatedly the seat reservation was cancelled. The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me. LH obviously don't like their status customers in the front of the aircraft.",,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,no

The APU wasnâ€™t turned on until 5 minutes prior to departure time and even though it was a 5 am departure, the aircraft was stuffy and hot. Given the tight seating, I was expecting a barebones service. This, however, was not the case, the in-flight service was outstanding. For breakfast, they served a tasty omelet sandwich.

Aeroflot Russian Airlines,8.0,Glenn Pineda,2nd April 2013,I took Aeroflot SU2387 from ARN to SVO on 26 Mar and SU013 from LED to SVO on 31 Mar and I was pleasantly surprised with the cabin attendants who were well groomed courteous and able to communicate in standard English. The LED-SVO leg even had the bonus of the purser giving a brief of what one could see or do in Moscow. The meal services on both legs were conducted at lightning speed which I initially found worrisome as I was only halfway through my ARN-SVO meal when I saw the crew collecting the trays four rows away but I did see that the mainly Russian and Swedish passengers were already done eating so it was probably my pace that was the issue. For the prices I paid Aeroflot delivered exceptional value. I expected a Soviet relic but I experienced efficiency and service at its Russian best.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,yes

Staff at the airport were really friendly and helpful but as soon we got on the first flight the staff were rude. We could here them swearing and shouting to each other at the back of the plane. We had a long flight (6hrs) to Philadelphia and were only offered one drink and a cookie because no one had checked the catering before take off so there was no food on board. There was also no entertainment on board. Before taking our second flight we asked and checked if there was entertainment so we could prepare ourselves and buy magazine/books etc. The lady told us that each seat had a tablet style screen. When got on board there were only small central screens in the aisles and the headphone jacks gave so much feedback it was unbearable to listen to.

United Airlines,3.0,S LeBlanc-Medeiros,4th February 2016,I was not impressed with United. I flew from Ho Chi Minh City to Providence with a layover in Hong Kong. I ended up having a delay in Hong Kong for over 4 hours. We were supposed to leave at 11.15am but were told it wouldn't be until 5.15pm - but then we suddenly boarded at 3.15pm without the departures board changing from 5.15pm. The crew was grumpy and on several occasions one of the stewards raised his voice in annoyance at an older man who spoke Chinese and was having trouble with his entertainment system. My inflight entertainment was unresponsive unless I jabbed very hard at the screen (which I wasn't going to do because there was someone sitting in front of me trying to sleep). They restarted the system but it did not help. And I was told condescendingly that I was just pressing too many time and the screen was freezing. I was purposely pressing the touchscreen slowly once and waiting and waiting. But they couldn't be bothered to assist me. Seats were uncomfortable. I did not like the food. Usually I like airline food. The chicken rice dish was watery and goopy. I definitely would not recommend flying United Airlines.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SGN to PVD,January 2016,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,no

The seat arrangement is most comfortable among all business classes (1+2+1 for the aircraft I flew) and service reminds of a high class restaurant due to small but important details. Serving drinks in dedicated glassware instead of one uniform glass, food served on china plates instead of plastic trays, engaged and helpful staff, high quality cosmetics (maybe except of Armani sets handed out previously). The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off.

The airline was delayed for 3 hours which would have been okay, if it wasn't for the rest of the ride. Some of the inflight entertainment monitors were broken, mine included. No wifi was available at all. It was easily 100 degrees with the air conditioning. The descent gave me airsickness for the first time in my life and it was the worst landing I've felt yet. Then we waited 20 minutes sweltering, waiting to taxi to the gate. Finally I emerge and our bags are not there because of the ""volume of luggage"" on the flight. So we have to wait.

When I saw I was Emirates coming back from Bangkok I was very happy as I had heard great things about them. In the end it was a disaster. Couldn't check in all the way through with my family at Phuket so had to wait until a desk opened in Bangkok then best part of 45 mins. Once on the aircraft we had been split up so cabin crew tried to sort this out but a very large person who had booked the seat insisted having it. It was sorted in the end but took a long time. As for the seats they where like rocks to sit on for any time. I was amazed that the cabins have large screen that keep coming on and off telling us here we are. One was directly over my 5 month old Granddaughter and every time it came on it woke her up.

This was a 90th birthday surprise party for her. When she arrived at the gate escorted by my niece, she was informed that she could not carry on her luggage. This was because no American Airlines employee would be willing to lift her carry on case to the overhead bin. Her carry on case was within the size required for carry on, however, would not fit under the seat. My 90 year old mother is unable to lift items above her head. My niece was not permitted to enter the cabin of the aircraft to lift the carry on for her. My mother takes a variety on medications and could not risk the chance of losing her luggage in the stowed compartment of the aircraft.

The slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff I have ever seen on a flight. There were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. The crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if I had not asked them to turn them off.

Again the center console was visibly dirty. I paid almost $5000 for this? The flight attendants were unfriendly and we were made to feel that we were an inconvenience for them. Our connection was in Newark and the plane we were supposed to leave on was diverted to another airport. Flight was delayed for hours while we waited for another plane. That one was United Express and that plane was very old and the interior was not maintained. My husband wents to the lavatory at the back of the plane and said there was a crack in the interior plastic. Part of my armrest was missing. I have to wonder what the state of the mechanics on these aged planes is like if the interior that is visible to the customers is so bad. I will avoid United Airlines whenever possible in the future.

American Airlines,2.0,P Stanire,31st December 2017,âœ… Trip Verified | Montreal to Miami. First of all they charge to check in your luggage and whats even more ridiculous is that they charge extra if your suitcase is over 50 pounds. I paid to check in my suitcase who cares about weight. Once I got to my gate they said the overhead was full so I had to check in my carry on. I wasn't too happy. They promised me the overhead was full and there was no way around it. I finally caved and complained so they didn't charge me. So I basically would have paid to check in my first suitcase for nothing. When I got in the airplane at my seat I noticed they completely lied to me and the overheads were practically empty. The seats have cheap covers on them I'm not impressed!!,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Miami,December 2017,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,A Barden,21st November 2017,"âœ… Trip Verified | The plane was super cramped and no food was offered unless you pay for it, including pretzels. Our return flight was a nightmare. We had to change our return date a day early (same flight route). The AC desk at the Portland airport has selective hours and no one there until 2 hours before the first flight out. So we had to wait 1.5 hours for staff to change the flight. The girl arrived and we were first in line (with a huge line up behind us). Staff said we booked it with a third party so we have to go through them to change anything. We asked if there was still room on the flights we were looking to retuning and she said yes. We asked if she could do anything for us, and if there is anything we can do to get on this flight. She said she can't help us and when we exhibited frustration from waiting over an hour and a half in line for a desk agent she said others are waiting too and you are holding them up! After an hour on the phone trying to change our flights, AC wanted $200 per ticket change fee and the price difference between flights which was over $1,400. No one was willing to do anything for us.

Jetblue Airways,,Heather Roberstein,22nd August 2010,"JFK to Austin TX. I really thought the competitive advantage that Jetblue had over other airlines was the CEO vision of being a ""friendly airline"". I remember the blue chips and jokes that the crews made before take-off when Jetblue started up. That is no longer the case. An older gentleman in the front row of my flight asked for a snack while the flight attendant was taking beverage orders. She spoke to him in a very rude tone and stated that she would not serve any snacks until she was finished with the beverage service. The gentlemen had no time between flights to eat. The food was an arm length away from her but she refused. She was very rude to another woman who placed her carry on in an overhead two rows up from her seat. She made her move it one compartment over. And Jetblue what is with the manual emergency instructions - with built in televisions we have to watch a manual instruction? Jetblue will not see me back as a customer. The prices are higher than the other airlines unless they are flying you on a special. The rude crews and the fact that JFK is the hub for Jetblue is enough reason for me to shop elsewhere!",,,,,,,,,,,1.0,no

Air Canada,1.0,Steven Johnston,5th April 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto. It started with the grounding of the 737 Max 8 which lead to the first cancellation of my flights on March 15. This is understandable. I went online and changed all of my flights and my wife's flights and lost a day of travel but had everything sorted. I was now due to depart on the 16th. I got a call on the 15th from an agent saying my new flight was cancelled due to a schedule change. I questioned the reason ""schedule change"" as the agent didn't realize my wife was on the same plane and my wife's ticket was still good. Everything got rebooked to have us routed through Vancouver and then overnighting now in Toronto and arriving the following day in Charlotte. When I arrived in Vancouver I got a text that my plane to Toronto was cancelled and I wasn't departing Vancouver until 11:55pm to Toronto with a 1 hour gap between my arrival and the flight to Charlotte. This was a problem as my luggage was all tagged to Toronto as I was supposed to be getting off and collecting my bags. I went to luggage services and arranged for the bags to all be redirected to Charlotte. I was assured this happened. When I arrived in Toronto I was met with the news that 2 out of 3 of my bags were not located. They almost did not let me board to the US with missing luggage but we finally got through with 4 minutes to spare and a very long run across the airport. I had to purchase new clothes as my bags were missing for three days. I finally got my bags but had to keep calling them to check on them and had to report the issue three different times as they failed to file a proper file number. I was never given the file number and I am now struggling to claim these charges. Due to the three flight cancellations I incurred charges for two missed hotel stays that couldn't be cancelled. We had a great time in Charlotte and on the last day I checked in online for my flight and it said to arrive at the airport 3 hours early for the international flight so we did. When we arrived at the airport there is only one Air Canada counter and there were no staff present to check our bags. We waited for 45 minutes after having the airport page them for someone to show up. When the agent finally showed up and we questioned why we have to be here three hours before our flight but she wasn't here, her response was ""My schedule says I start at 9 take it up with my boss"". There is a sign on the counter that says an agent will only be present 3 hours before flight departure times which clearly was not the case. I emailed air Canada customer service twice regarding these issues and the first response was a generic canned response addressing the grounding of the Max 8 737, which did not address my concerns. I noticed through my trip, no matter the issue they were using that as the reason for everything. I originally asked for someone to call me which has still not happened and I have written a reply to their email which they have not responded to. There were multiple opportunities available for the airline to step up and do something such as hotel vouchers during layovers etc. but they did nothing and the failure to address my emails with a legitimate response is disgraceful.",,Business,Economy Class,Edmonton to Charlotte via Toronto,March 2019,4.0,4.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,no

After two delays our flight on january 2nd 2019 was canceled leaving us stranded in Puerto Vallarta. This airline doesn't inform passengers, doen't plan ahead and most of all doesn't care about you! Passengers had to inform themselves what was going on. Story most heard was that due to fog in the morning in Mexico City Aeromexico started to book passanger from the first planes that had to leave out of Mexico City over to later flights. That meant that the last flights had to be cancelled. They knew that from the start. Didn't act and let passenger on these last flights hours in stress before telling them at midnight that they could retrieve their bags from the belt and look for shelter. We had a 24 hour delay, had to take a bus to Guadalajara because this stupid action which also caused overbooked flights for the next four days(!). There were no excuses, no compensation whatsoever.

It is from another age and the new airport which was supposed to be finished by 2012 is not yet in service.

The plane had a new seat design that offered a little more comfort than the previous flights. The seats also had power outlets. The inflight entertainment was not very good. The entertainment consisted of the TV playing the same video the entire 4 hour flight and the only way to change the channel was to pay $6. This was a huge disappointment to other flights I have taken where United offered free movies and some TV shows.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,C Danielsson,21st June 2013,I'm elite member Flying Blue and fly to Rio de Janeiro from 4 to 5 times a year. I have determined that the value of the trip will depends very much on the cabin crew who are just on the flight. On my second last flight KLM 705 on April 10 the cabin crew were excellent whereupon KLM 705 June 16 cabin staff were of a very low level. Some staff will do everything so the guest will enjoy the journey while another crew sees the guest mostly as a distraction to their work. Aircraft's are ok but no more a major upgrade is necessary but what really makes the experience of KLM worthy as a choice is cabin crew.

I had the same seat on the first flight, but did not look at the second. Big mistake. They had put me on standby despite me having checked in earlier. When I got to Amsterdam I was told the flight had been heavily oversold and there was nothing they could do. I went to the gate to find total chaos. Loads of people were without seats and they were asking for volunteers to miss the flight. In the end, after much argument I got an Economy seat. I have sent two emails to KLM customer service but with no reply. I got sent a completely incomprehensible automatically generated email which nobody I show it to can explain.

Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite.

Seats on the old Boeing 747-400 were uncomfortable and there was so little space for me to stretch out my legs. There was no inflight entertainment except for one big screen that showed movies. Food service was okay, I enjoyed the chicken katsu curry they served. Flight delayed a bit at Chicago, but when we were finally boarding, the flight was full so they had to take carry-on bags and stow them with the checked luggage. Pretty disappointed that United Airlines couldn't find a way to fix that problem. Flight was really crowded so I felt squished in and couldn't move that much.

I will be considering taking my business elsewhere as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore.

United Airlines,1.0,T Allen,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to Newark. I had a bad feeling when I booked with United but as this was for a job interview and I was asked to fly out in three days, I didn't have any other choice but to take whatever flights were available - my original sense of dread turned out to be justified and I certainly will not be flying with United again. The flight was scheduled to take off at 7:30 PM, it's 9:38 PM and I'm still here. Initially, they announced a 3 hour delay, then, figuring that wasn't inconvenient enough, they changed it to 4 hours. So instead of arriving at my destination at 9:30 PM as I was originally scheduled to do so, I will be getting in at 1:40 AM - no big deal. And of course the United employees at the kiosk make it quite clear through their laissez faire attitude, and at times downright rude behavior, that they really don't care about the fact that paying customers are waiting out a 4 hour delay. It's very obvious United doesn't give any thought to customer service. When asked what the issue is, they respond with ""Oh, the plane is undergoing maintenance."" Funny, I figured maintenance would be done routinely, not when it has the potential to ruin as many lives as possible. And, shouldn't there maybe be a backup plan? Is every single United plane currently being used with no consideration given to the possibility of unforeseen mishaps like this? I especially like the response I received from the snooty United employee when I asked if there were any other flights available - ""No, probably not..."" Probably not? Umm, do you mind checking perhaps? Which she begrudgingly did after I asked. Real problem solvers they got there. I'm also really glad I signed up for both their email and text message alerts regarding flight changes. I received neither. I'm sure they just didn't want to fill up my inbox or use up my monthly text message allowance. I suppose United figured this was the best way to earn back some respect. Nice job guys, this will certainly be my last flight with this airline.

I had paid for the suitcases, but because I was traveling alone I went there with my husband and he politely asked if they could please take the carryons on the plane because she canâ€™t carry everything by herself. The manager came out and said that we have to pay. I said I already paid extra for my suitcases please help us because my wife is carrying our son, the diaper bag and 2 carryons. He was rude stating that we have to pay each carryon. We didnâ€™t have the extra money and my wife took everything with her. If thatâ€™s how Turkish Airline treats their customers, they shouldnâ€™t be operating. It was the last time I use this airline. No dignity or humanity, itâ€™s all only about the money.

I asked why, he replied that the money I have converted in dollars was not enough for the living standard in Germany (I must have with me an amount equal to 70 euros a day) I have answered that I am only staying in transit in Germany for a few hours, so the rules of the schengen visa don't apply for me, and I have shown that amount of money to the Ukrainian embassy and they accepted. Accommodation was covered during my stay in the host country and I was clear in the original letter of invitation that I have shown him. He seemed convinced after what I have said and he left. After a couple of seconds he came back and told me that I cannot leave because my letter wasn't in English or German, I showed him that It was original and written in Ukrainian because these were the requirements from the embassy of Ukraine but, the main words such as my name, passport number, place, date, program name, and other information like the accommodation that was provided were mentioned in English.

Delta Air Lines,,S Ahmed,26th August 2014,"Munich - Atlanta - Kalamazoo and returning from Chicago - Atlanta - Munich. My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich. Once I touched down in Munich you can now imagine what is going to come or in fact not going to come - my luggage! Will never travel with them again.",,,Economy Class,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,T Irving,15th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Frankly the worst airline and a disgrace to the American people for calling themselves American Airlines. They are a horrible representation of our country with their lack of service, lack of care or accountability. My flight from SJC to a connecting flight at LAX landed late. 10mins before the gate was scheduled to close, we were told that our gate had changed. We took off later because we had to wait for passengers to disembark first. At LAX, we taxied for 20mins before the captain decided to inform us of the delay from traffic and light rain. My layover was only 50mins so I only had 10mins to get to my gate by the time I disembarked. I informed ground staff about this to which they just pointed to a massive line at gate 52G which required a bus transfer to Terminal 4. There were many in line who had a connecting flight from LAX to HKG, like myself, but they did nothing to ensure we would make the flight. When myself and others arrived at the gate, AA staff simply shrugged and pointed us to customer service who gave many of the customers attitude. I was ""lucky"" enough to be booked onto the next flight 24hrs later w/ a hotel. The next day I confirmed with AA staff at the gate twice and customer service that my checked baggage would be on board. They all confirmed, however, it never made it onboard. I had to call incessantly to finally have them track my bag. I finally received my bag 4 days later with items stolen...Lastly, the boarding pass says ""gate closes 10mins before flight"".

Initial flight delayed 2 hours. Missed connection by 10 minutes. No attempt to get me off the plane (or the other 10 people on that connection) quicker was made. We possibly could have made that flight if we were allowed to exit first. Second, calling help line I asked when the next flight out was, she said ""tomorrow"" and laughed. They offer no protection for weather delays, I was given a toothbrush kit with bathroom essentials after lying on the terminal carpet for nine hours. I purchased a bottle of whiskey and put it in my carry-on in Jackson after checking with airline security that this was allowed. The next day, they actually tried to charge me to check my carry-on or dump the bottle out. Since I bought my own hotel room and left the terminal, this bottle was no longer considered safe. When I asked them to comp it as an ""I'm sorry how poor your flight was"" the check in lady said, ""it not like it's our fault you bought whiskey"" - after asking her supervisor, they comped the whiskey.

American Airlines,3.0,D Ljunggren,6th July 2014,What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful.

American Airlines,1.0,L Chee,15th August 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I have never experience such a frustrating flight ever before. This is the first time I fly with American Airlines and will be the last time. My husband and I flew from Charlotte, NC to Santa Ana, CA and there was just delay after delay. I really didn't mind the delay at all because I knew that there was nothing that they could have done, what is done is done. But were there not any protocol to check the plane before letting passenger board the airplane? We sat there for a hour before they told us that everyone have to leave the airplane because they couldn't fix it and they need to give us a new airplane. So our flight was supposed to depart at 6:30 a.m. but we did not depart until 8:30 a.m. We got back on the plane and sit there for another hour because there was some ""computer glitches."" Obviously, we missed our connecting flight. Once we landed in Dallas to try to catch our connecting flight that we already missed, the staff handed us some new boarding pass to our new connecting flight which was a thumb up. But wait, that wasn't it. They gave us the wrong boarding pass, because while my husband and I waited for our plane to get boarded, we heard over the intercom, ""Last call for (our names) to Santa Ana."" My husband and I look at each other and was confuse on why do another flight have our names instead of the flight we were supposed to get on by the boarding pass the staff hand out to us. Well, we couldn't complain because it was an earlier flight or we will have to wait for another hour, but we were really concern about our baggages. When we arrived to Santa Ana, we did got our baggages, so that was maybe one thing that AA did right. On our flight back home, everything was going well. The flight were on time, no delays, we didn't have any problem. But once we arrive to Phoenix for our connecting flight, there were some problems. When I handed that staff my boarding pass, I couldn't board, because I ""did not check in."" If I did not check in, how did I arrived to Phoenix from California? And how did I have my boarding pass in my hand? My mother in law and husband is checked in and able to board, but I wasn't able to when we obviously all checked in together. Obviously AA is horrible with delay, so they obviously bump me off the flight and give my seat to someone else that flight was delay. My husband was not having it, after throwing a little scene, they offered to give me a $500 voucher and a hotel room. Of course, I was not having it, time could not be bought. But thankfully another passenger volunteer to stay so I could take their seat. But it's ridiculous how my seat was given to someone else and they overbooked the flight. AA really need to work on their flight, not always being delay and screwing people over. Do not recommend this airline to anyone.

When I initially booked our flight I was informed basinettes could not be booked in advance but would be allocated at check-in. At Check-in at Dublin airport all basiinettes for the first leg of our journey from Dublin to Istanbul had already been taken which was annoying but ok with us. However, the second leg of the journey from Istanbul to Dammam, we were informed by the check-in person that she was unable to allocate the basinette seats for us since it had been 'closed' out from her system, even though this flight wasn't due to depart for another 13 hours. We were allocated seats for the second leg in row 29. On boarding the second flight I noticed that one set of basinettes seats were occupied by a man and woman who had no child with them. I brought this to the attention of the nearest cabin crew and she informed me that she would notify the senior purser. Of course nothing happened, no one came to me, no one offered an apology or an explanation.

Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly.

Delta Air Lines,1.0,G Lay,6th January 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | London to Salt Lake City. I had not flown Delta for over 20 years, and only did so due to the Virgin Atlantic code share. I was intrigued to try their much vaunted Delta One business class. The aircraft was an old B-767-300, which was in awful shape. The so-called business class was atrocious, and must be at least 20 years out of date. I thought British Airways Club Class was bad, but this was worse. The food onboard was inedible, and the wine selection poor. The ONLY good thing about Delta Airlines, was the use of the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class lounge at Heathrow. Other than that, there was nothing to commend about this flight, or indeed this airline.

No issue with check in - all handled smoothly and good boarding at Cape Town. As others have said the Boeing 777 has narrower seats and aisles - not a problem for me, but does reduce the quality of the flight for some. Food, I ordered special meals which came as requested and okay. In Dubai had to be transferred to and from the planes by bus which lengthens the transfer time. The airport has been built to take more people but seems to be bursting at the seams.

Emirates,5.0,Gooneratne Dinala,23rd January 2015,Series of Trips on EK MEL-CMB-MEL and CMB-CAI-CMB. All sectors in Business except DXB-CMB which was in First. Check in Good. Lounges not bad. However the quality of food in DXB has been going down over time. Good Welcome on Boarding. IFE is AVOD and excellent as always. Staff can be hit or miss mostly a miss. The quality of meals on board keeps going down every month. Bread basket is brought around only when you are nearly done with the main. Of all the sectors I flew the food on EK 650 First Class from DXB to CMB was the worst. The curry sauce which accompanied the rice tasted like chillies mixed with water. Depending on how much you pay for ticket it is still value for money. But EK is on a steep downward spiral.

Air New Zealand,5.0,S Peal,1st January 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Singapore to Auckland return. We were very excited to finally find an afforable Air New Zealand fare from London to Auckland in December for a family of four. We flew Singapore Airlines from London to Singapore and then Air New Zealand to Auckland. I haven't flown Air New Zealand since 2001 as I found them disappointing then. But having heard that they have won awards for various categories I wanted to give them another go for our once in a few years family holiday back to NZ. I found them arrogant, rude and completely lacking in the sensational customer service I know and look forward to in and around New Zealand. On our return flight from Auckland to Singapore 80% of the flight we had the seat belt sign on for turbulence. This is a 9 plus hour flight and staff were quick and blunt to tell passengers to return to their seats when they got up to use the loo. I understand the need for measures to keep passengers safe during periods of expected turbulence but completely unrealistic to pressure people to ""hold on"" for extended periods of time. They even told us that we couldn't take our 6 year old to the toilet and implied if she wet herself then not to worry as the seats can be cleaned on arrival? Don't even get me started on the uniforms, utterly horrendous. Tray tables were also disgustingly dirty. The likes of Singapore and Emirates win hands down in terms of air steward/stewardess class and service. I will not be wasting my money on air New Zealand again.

The check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination (Faro) but not us! This created a bit of a problem for the TAP staff at Lisbon. On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin. There was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. Continental breakfast was served but the coffee/tea forgotten - our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told ""okay but it will be cold"". After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef). The whole service seemed to lack leadership which comes from the cabin supervisor - so if anyone from Emirates reads this I would hope they investigate.

Southwest Airlines,10.0,T Blackwell,6th January 2016,I get terribly motion sick so I have chosen to drive for years. This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer.

But from my last experience from American Airlines, I made it my obligation to review this poor flight. I had a flight from Norfolk to San Diego via Dallas. I arrive at my flight on time just for them to delay my flight for an hour. Finally take off and when I arrive at Dallas my flight was just now taking off. I was extremely annoyed. Had to wait in a line for up to an hour and a half since there was an absurd amount of people that missed their flight as well. Was told that my next guaranteed flight will be that next following day, but I have the option to wait for the last available flights of that night, I will just be on stand by. Waited for 3 long hours to see if me and my girlfriend can squeeze in but we got denied. I was told I was number 14 on the list but another administrator told me I was number 12 on the stand by list. Very unorganized. The only positive thing that came from this was that they gave us an hotel voucher for the night. However, I was told that my bags had already took off without me and I will have to go get them at the baggage claim when I arrive at SD. Not only that, but when I was in a line for my hotel voucher, you can even hear the customer assistance saying â€œIâ€™m leaving in 2 minutes, Im going home.â€ Mind you there are groups of people waiting to find a place to stay that have been traveling all day long. What type of service is that? Glad to know that American Airlines care about their passengers. That next following morning I wait by the gate to board my flight that was around 06:20. Came to find out that they switched the flight to another gate number when I went to the help desk to see if I was at the right location. Thank god I asked or I would of missed out on another flight. Nobody even notified us that the gate number even had changed. What type of service is that? I will never in my life fly this company again.

Air New Zealand,5.0,Paula Ding,2nd June 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Dunedin to Los Angeles via Auckland. For this flight, the booking agent put me on a connecting flight with a non-star alliance carrier. And at the check-in gate, I was informed that I might have to pay an extra $800when I got to the US because it was a non star alliance flight. This was not advised when I booked the flight, otherwise I would have chose a different connecting flight! Not what I call great service for a $4000USD++ ticket. The attitude tone of the gate agents was not helpful either. Generally service on the flights is excellent, but I do notice that overall customer service is declining significantly outside of the flights. Service from agents varies significantly. Information provided on baggage policies etc is inconsistent or not disclosed by all agents so be very careful to ask and keep a record. Not all agents disclose full fee policies. For example, one time the airline tried to withhold a service fee from a refund. Fortunately, I was refunded but only because they reviewed the phone recordings which confirmed that I explicitly asked the original agent about the policies (and the agent hadn't mentioned a service fee withholding). As background, I have been flying on Air NZ for over 13 years and been an elite or gold airpoints member for over 8 years. With the non-flight service experience declining, I will definitely not be as loyal in future.",,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dunedin to Los Angeles via Auckland,2017-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,no

Aegean Airlines,5.0,A Christodoulou,21st February 2014,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,yes

Once on board I was greeted by a very lovely and attentive Flight attendant, who walked me to my First Class Suite 2A. Drinks, Arabic coffee and dates were offered right after. As I was the only First Class passenger, the attention I received was beyond what was needed which I deeply appreciated. Breakfast was served right after takeoff, everything tasted delicious and there was endless snacks and drinks on offer even when you don't even ask for it. The onboard service was just on another level, but my greatest appreciation goes to the FA who attended to me, they were just so genuinely nice.

Pre clearance is way better since the re-configuration (well done Pearson) and I was in the lounge on a guest pass within 30 mins of entering the airport. Easy boarding and an on time flight with a swift beverage service. On time arrival and fast bags. Sadly the return flight was like flying with a different airline. We checked in 5 mins after the 1 hour cut for hold baggage off due to our ferry being late and the Water Taxi taking longer than expected. (note to self - next time, take a cab). We were denied checking in our bag due to TSA needing an hour to assess the bags. Reminding the check in staff that in May, they were happy to walk the bags through after a double cancellation the response was - that was Runway reconstruction, this is Irma). How a hurricane in the south affected an AC flight from Boston to Toronto was a mystery (other than the obvious abdication of responsibility or helping the customer). The check in staff were sympathetic but the supervisor stood her ground. We weren't allowed to travel without our bags, and the only option was to rebook. The good news was there was room on the next flight two hours later. The bad news - a 75 buck change fee each for the privilege. With no other option we re-booked though they were kind enough to tag our bags as priority. Boarding was efficient but the AC gate area at Boston is in the running for the most cramped and soulness departure gates on the AC network. The flight was fine with the usual beverage service and an on time arrival in Toronto. In the race for maximising profit and cheesing off customers - Air Canada wins first prize. We were 5 mins late for bags - sure.

The Delta agent I talked to had no clue as to why the flight had been cancelled. Delta is the worst as far as reliable flights.

The delay ended up being 2 hours. For the first part of the trip we sat at the gate at LA, but eventually pushed back and sat out on the tarmac somewhere until we got clearance from San Francisco. Understandably some passengers were upset because of possible missed connections at SFO, but weather is what it is, and an airline can't help that. Some opted to disembark before we pushed back from the terminal. The pilot was very courteous and apologetic. You could tell he cared as he tried to work whatever magic he could to get us out as early as possible. He was even apologetic over the the way some of the ground crew was apparently dealing with customer concerns which he felt wasn't totally what it should have been. Some things he apparently overheard and apologized for. The cabin crew onboard the flight was pleasant as well (though I think it would have been cool if they had offered water, or peanuts or something as we sat waiting.

American Airlines,1.0,Brian E. Smith,3rd April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | New York JFK to Raleigh Durham. American Airlines is a partner airline through OneWorld with Japan Airlines. I had to purchase a separate ticket with American to get to and from my final destination paired with a mileage ticket on JAL. Huge mistake. Coming over to the US on JAL, they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination (RDU) and all was smooth. Returning to Tokyo, American Airlines refused no, matter who I spoke to. I was willing to pay for the luggage fees (despite being in business on JAL from JFK) and begged to have them check them all the way through. No go. After this, the flight up to JFK was delayed and the prognosis wasnâ€™t good early on. While trying to get help from a gate agent for rebooking options, I was yelled at! In the end, as a seasoned traveler, I made had to make complicated arrangements to make sure I could get the following dayâ€™s connection. The terminal at JFK is substandard as well. The gates are far from the check-in and there are not enough TSA agents working. This is only the second time Iâ€™ve flown this routing from Japan to RDU and both times there was only ONE TSA lane open for the entire American Airlines terminal! People were going ballistic! In short, the customer service level of American Airlines is disgraceful and disgusting. Shouting at passengers, unwilling to check bags on partner airlines internationally, delays, and shabby aircraft all made for a horrible experience with them. Iâ€™ll never fly them again.

They began to offer food for purchase only to find that there was only enough food for the first 1/3 of the plane. On this long flight they only came through the cabin once for beverages. A week later found us at the United counter because one member of our group of three had mysteriously been dropped from the reservation. It took over an hour to get United to see the error. Then of course the flight from Aruba to Houston was delayed but at least we didn't have to wait on the plane this time. Flight attendants were at least cordial and offered beverage service twice. They offered food as well but we had learned our lesson and ate in Aruba! Late getting into Houston so had to run (again) to catch our next plane for our final destination.

The return flight from MIA was delayed by 3 hours after we had to return to the gate. The expalnation given wasn't really ample, something about lack of catering and that we had to refuel due to the longer then usual taxiing, sounded really strange to us. Anyway, rebookings for missed connections at LHR were taken care of, and we were given new boarding cards when we got off the plane at LHR, no stress. Regarding the flights, we liked the new seat. It is very comfortable for sleeping although it could have a little more padding. Better than British Airways Club World seat in my opinion (BA is better for privacy if you are in a window seat). IFE and WiFi are very good, good movie selection and relaible WiFi (but it should be free of charge in business class, charging 17USD is borderline indecent). Food could also use a little improvement (love their ice cream sundaes though, which sadly weren't available on the inbound flight). There were no amenity bags for the MIA-LHR leg something I actually missed because I had most of my stuff in the checked baggage and I had no moisturiser at hand. Worst part of the journeys were probably ground service at Miami which left alot to be desired, staff were rude and not very helpful.

Turkish Airlines,1.0,C Larnoute,17th May 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | On a recent â€˜round-tripâ€™ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didnâ€™t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Budapest via KUL / IST,2018-05-01 00:00:00,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,no

You can connect via wifi to the UA-app to view movies, but this app doesn't work on Android tablets (fix it UA!), so you have to use your phonescreen. App wasn't working at all the first hour.

They didn't even bother about the uniforms, because a woman whom I thought was a passenger turned out to be a flight attendant. Inbound flight in Boeing 777 with ptv which also didn't work for the first hour. Promised wifi didn't work at all. Mainly UK based rather cold crew. Food and drinks again okay. Both flights punctual.

Emirates,8.0,Dick van Kooten,9th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there's a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there's a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type ""what are the cheapest ingredients we can find"". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380's but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn't. They can't. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000's euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like ""Sorry you didn't like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry"". So they can't serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don't take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don't want to read news. But it can't be switched off.",A380-800,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai,February 2017,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,yes

The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock.

United Airlines,3.0,B Brooks,26th December 2015,"It is common knowledge that United Airlines has slipped behind both American and delta on virtually all service parameters, but their PS service decline is especially alarming as it was the market leader for a few years. Took flight 497 from Newark to San Francisco on 25 December in business first and it was very disappointing. No amenity kits, flight attendants told other passengers that there was absolutely no food available during the 3+ hour gap after breakfast, although they stood in the galley eating snacks. For a good half hour after meal service the front galley was blocked by carts so both pilots could use the facilities and socialize with the flight attendants. All passengers finished eating and trays sat uncollected. Eventually someone had to ring call button and was told off and instructed to use economy bathroom. Both front cabin attendants were unfriendly and one openly hostile to passengers. Absolutely no contact with passengers for much of the flight. Have used the new transcontinental service of American Airlines and Delta and they are much better. This is all on top of shifting PS flights to Newark which is a chaotic mess - basically a cheap mall filled with poor signage and long lines.

The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airlineâ€™s fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading.

United Airlines,1.0,Sara Randall,28th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I will never fly United again and this is why. I was to depart Cleveland to Chicago on 26 November at 6:35pm. We did not leave the runway until 8:25pm for a fuel overfilling. I have never heard of such a thing! There 4 updates given and they were not timely and obviously they were not accurate. We arrived in Chicago at 8:38p. My connecting flight was to depart Chicago at 8:50pm and boarding stopped at 8:35pm. I asked several flight attendants if my gate could be called and I was told they couldn't control that. It seemed like I was the only person on this plane with that connecting flight. There were others going to Istanbul Turkey that United called ahead for them not to miss their connection. An announcement was even made that they didn't need to rush. When we landed in Chicago I had to run from gate B14 to E1. I have never run so fast, in heels, in my life. When I arrived at E1 the plane had pulled away. I was livid! I went to a customer service counter for assistance and was told there were no more flights leaving Chicago to Milwaukee that night and that I could take a bus. A bus? I didn't want to but I was ready to go home to say the least. The time then was 9:00pm. I was told the bus wasn't leaving until 10:45p and it was the last bus. Arriving Milwaukee at 12:30am. I inquired about my luggage and was given instructions on how to get it. After going to another service counter, I was able to get my luggage, 20 minutes later. The second service counter attendant told me the bus shuttle was right outside the door and to follow the red Bus Shuttle sign. She even pointed to a Coach bus going by telling me that's where I'd get on the bus. I hadn't been on a bus since I was 12 years old. She offered and gave $20 worth of food vouchers but I didn't use them. I was too distraught. I sat in the terminal waiting to go to the bus stop. At 10:15 something told me to go and find out exactly where I needed to stand. I asked an airport shuttle driver and he told me to follow him. He pointed to shuttles/buses that were across the street and about a 10 minute walk away! I had to run again, this time with luggage. As I entered the bus terminal there was no one available to ask which stop, 4, 5,6, etc, I was supposed to stand near. I asked the transit cop and he told me to stand at #4. I asked what time was the bus coming. He said the bus usually gets there at 10:30pm. My watch said 10:32p. He then said he must be running a little late. I didn't want to take any chances so I stool outside the terminal, right in front of the #4 stand, waiting for the bus. Once on the bus, the driver announced since this was the last bus of the night he had to wait an additional 10 minutes before departing. I arrived at the bus station in Milwaukee WI at 12:38am.

When I mentioned it to the stewardess she answered in a surly tone ""So sorry"". She was rude. I thought that was bad enough but on our return visit our luggage was not on the plane when we reached Greensboro (PTI). We understood because due to weather we had to catch another 2nd leg flight. They delivered our luggage in the middle of the night and when we opened it in the morning, everything was drenched and much of our clothes were ruined. White clothes had blue stains on them. My husband had a $400 custom made jacket that had blue stains all over it and we were told without a receipt there is no reimbursement. He bought the jacket several years ago and who saves receipts from years back? I will never fly American again!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,GSO to MCO,July 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,no

First, I bought a ticket in May for a wedding in September, the wedding was cancelled so I called to see what I could do. I was told I had to cancel my ticket to request a refund and that it would be processed in 7 business days (this was July 6th, still 3 months ahead of the wedding date!) Then, I went on a trip from July 12-24 to Aruba, United cancelled out flight from Houston to Aruba and we had to fly all the way up to Newark, NJ and spend the night in the freezing cold airport in order to get to Aruba on time for our house check in. There is hardly any leg room, the workers are rude and very unhelpful! On the trip back we had to fly to Miami, we had to collect and recheck and repay for our luggage! $200 worth! Then, even though we had just carried on a bag and a personal item, we were told we couldn't on the next flight because we were group 9! Seriously? Thankfully we had a better airline from Houston home! Then, when I got home I checked the status of my refund only to find that they ""can't refund my ticket"" so now I am out almost $400 and they will be making money on the seat that I cancelled! Seriously wrong! If I was told I would get the refund, they should honor that regardless of the policy! That is misleading and theft! Worst airline ever!

Emirates,6.0,B Rayler,1st March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn't be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would've allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn't call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn't get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it's been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their ""saver"" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline. For such long flights, it would be nice to have peace of mind that your family will be sitting together.",A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai,January 2017,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no

The attendant offered online vouchers which he said would be available after the flight had departed. They weren't. I am a celiac and I did not pack food because I was having dinner in Chicago that night which, I missed. Airplane food at best is inedible but add gluten free and you're stuffed. I packed nothing because I didn't think I was going to need to. Error! The flight landed in O'Hare at 10.30pm and of course everything on a Monday was shut. By the time I got to my Hotel room and went back out to look for food it was 12.30. Upon return that week I wrote to United as speaking to a human is impossible. Anyway they were so generous in offering me a whole $50 dollars in flight vouchers. Luckily I won't be able to cash them in because I would never fly (voluntarily) United.

The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm.

The personal light, remote control and cabin crew call button did not work. Luckily this worked on the the empty seat next to mine. The crew was apologizing, but even several tries to reboot the system did not help. So I moved to the other seat. The food service had difficulties to cope with me sitting in another seat : now I was in a seat being served by the other crew. Food was poor as well. The Miso soup was lukewarm without taste and the lamb was overcooked. All in all a very disappointing experience.

Air Canada,2.0,Samy-George Salib,26th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them ""brushing"" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need ""Go to town"" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline.

American Airlines,1.0,J Lenache,24th April 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Oakland to JFK,New York via Phoenix with American Airlines. Last minute tickets due to a sudden tragic family death. Huge price paid since discount for traveling under circumstances caused by a death refused/eliminated. Made to sit trapped in a plane for an hour delay due to a ""tire issue."" No temperature control and no crowd control within the plane. I watched the three mechanics below remove the tire, lay it on the tarmac and then appear to be standing around. With a hot, full plane of passengers watching them out the window--you would think they'd work like a racing pit crew, but not them. Took off 1 hour late. Caused missed plane-change connecting flight. No even basic customer service given from gate agents nor the flight attendants about getting us out of Phoenix and home that night though we desperately asked for assistance. Some planes were held so people could make the connection, ours was not with no reason given. We we got on the last American flight out that night only because a nice guy working for the Phoenix airport had a motorized cart and he knew of the last American flight out of there that night and raced us over to it. American gate agent yelled at us as if it were our fault to be arriving late. We incurred a $100 taxi fare because the last plane was to San Francisco instead of Oakland. On JFK to Phoenix leg, multiple passengers and children were allowed to ignore the captain's message about returning to seats and strapping in. As a result aisle remained clogged, children climbing over seats unattended. The chaotic scene was a safety hazard. Flight attendants spent much time in their jump seats curtained off while they talked and laughed. Ran out of food and drinks except warm water and orange juice. No power at seats, no seat screens and extremely limited entertainment options-sound on the music was scratchy and not tolerable. I rarely use American due to their poor ratings - I will not use them even if they were the last plane on earth !",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,OAK to JFK via PHX,April 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no
Lufthansa,4.0,Hessing Frank,10th December 2014,LH 465 from Orlando to Frankfurt on Nov 9th 2014. Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats.

Air Canada,9.0,P Rubenstein,31st October 2014,AC through its contract partner Sky Regional YUL-YTZ (RT DH4 service). Although the equipment is old and the seating is cramped the overall flight experience was good. Advance check-in eliminated the hassle of YUL check-in and aside from a change in gate at departure everything went smoothly. Changing my departure on the return was easily done at the airport by a pleasant agent. I used the MLL in YUL courtesy of my Elite status. Although the lounge was crowded I was surprised by the improved range of food available. The MLL agent was polite and smiling (in the past they have been grouchy). Significant improvement at the YUL MLL in the last year. The departure area at YTZ is shared with Porter and is run down shabby and crowded. Both flights were nearly on time despite weather conditions. This was my first use of AC at YTZ in many years as I have been a loyal client of Porter. I gave AC a try because of my displeasure with my past Porter flights specifically the deterioration in service and on time performance. AC is just as good if not better than Porter on this route and with my FF status the AC experience was superior overall. AC is excellent when there are no IROPS no baggage and it is a short haul flight.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,5.0,yes
United Airlines,3.0,Shirley-Grant Roma,31st March 2014,London Heathrow to Newark to connect to Fort Lauderdale Florida. My trip to Newark was uneventful. It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight.

Air New Zealand,7.0,C Wallace,4th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | My wife and I flew SkyCouch Houston to Auckland on February 2 and Auckland to Houston Feb 23. It is worth the USD 600 paid to have an empty middle seat, but the three seats are near useless as a lie-down bed for a normal size adult. For two adults side-by-side, itâ€™s almost impossible. On two flights nobody on our plane tried to use SkyCouch as a bed. I suffer from chronic leg cramps and excruciating muscle spasms in my legs [if not stretched every hour or so]. Not to mention the possibility of pulmonary vein thrombosis in a 73-yr-old person such as myself. I did have one episode of a terrible muscle spasm, which necessitated me having to unbuckle my seat belt and stand up to put weight on my leg to relieve the spasm. Luckily, the flight was smooth at the time and no flight attendant had to order me to sit down [without regard to the severe pain that would cause me]. However, as I was stretching my leg and walking to a restroom, an attendant told me I needed to return to my seat when the captain activated the fasten seat belt sign. Iâ€™m a veteran traveler and know it is almost impossible to have a rational discussion with a flight attendant following airline rules and guidelines and will not or cannot make exceptions no matter how much pain and discomfort a passenger might endure. Nonetheless, I did take a moment to explain my difficult situation to the young stewardess, who probably could not imagine my 73-yr-old condition. Of course, she showed no sensitivity or understanding whatsoever, and told me - in a tone which indicated she thought I may have been senile - that I might bump my head in rough air if I were not seated and secured with a fastened seat belt. The fact that may have caused me excruciating pain did not register at all with her. She could have cared less. In such a situation the risk to my safety and good health was far worse if I were seated and buckled-in than if I were allowed to stand for a few minutes until the spasm passed and the pain lessened. I doubt that this review will result in a more tolerant and enlightened approach by ANZ [or any other alrilnesâ€™ flight attendants], but I hope this description of my situation on NZ28 [departure from AKL on Feb 23] might result in attendants having a more open-minded approach to dealing with a passengerâ€™s medical issue. But I sincerely doubt it. On a non-medical issue, how about ANZ joining the 21st century and providing satelite WiFi with Internet on the IAH-AKL route?",Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Houston,February 2018,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,yes

Turkish Airlines,1.0,M Gregory,12th February 2014,9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail.

Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class.

United Airlines,1.0,S Schultz,13th July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | First and foremost this was my worst flying experience ever! We started are day by being at the airport at 7.30am. in Harrisburg, PA. We boarded plane (American Eagle) and were pulled out on tarmac and we had to stop due to no flights in or out of Philly. Weather cleared, we pulled out and the crew had to abandon flight due to mechanical issues. That brought us to our only option of flying United Airlines to IAD at 2.25 in the afternoon to get to a larger airport with more options. We had to wait for an incoming flight from IAD which was delayed due to a foul smell but we finally left after 4.00. Before leaving Harrisburg we had to change our connecting flight to MSP thinking there is no way we will make it. As it turned out we did make the flight, just barely. The plane was loaded and the door shut and we were ready to pull out. The entire flight had to get off and re check in because of a computer error. We were reloaded and then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours, flight crew not helpful, we were finally told we had to go back to gate for more gas which was a lie. In reality the flight crew timed out. No other crew available. The United help desk was so not helpful and horribly slow to re-book passengers. After nearly half an hour to 45 minutes we were able to finally get re-booked on flight to Chicago and then we would have to stay overnight and fly to MSP in the morning. At this point it was after 9 at night. We flew to Chicago (O'Hare) and luckily the flight scheduled for MSP was delayed two hours so we were able to make it home at 2.30 in the morning.

AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment.

Great seats (especially on the A380) with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. What disappointed me was first of all the service. In all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. No smiles at all. When you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. Another disappointment was food quality and quantity. Continental breakfast from DXB left me hungry for few hours. The rest of meals acceptable but not good as other European Airlines (AF or KLM for example). Overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as SQ or QF.

But in this case, price and schedule left me no choice, so AA it was. While they continue to try to find ways to cram more people on their planes, and seating is definitely tight, in this case, since it was a red eye, I fortunately managed to sleep through the flight despite being not very comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived a little early and I mostly slept through it, so I guess that's a win! The A321 had inflight entertainment provided via ones own device and wifi. I did not attempt to use it. One thing about AA and MIA is there is a very long walk from the terminal to where the baggage claim is and it took maybe 15 more minutes after this walk before luggage arrived. In this case, the price of the flight was good, I got to my destination safely on time, and I slept through the flight.

I show up to PDX at 3:00am to check in for a 6:00am departure (Iâ€™m an early bird). I wait until 4:30am and ask when Delta reps are supposed to be out. That was supposed to happen at 4am. So, thatâ€™s strike one. Not out until 4:45am where thereâ€™s a line of at least 30 people. First flight to SLC was fine. The flight staff I liked, they were the only ones I liked. Super short layover at SLC. Get on at SLC, the new staff made a big deal about a pet and made sure I knew not to remove the dog from the crate. Land at RDU, have maybe 20 minutes to deliver a puppy, check in, and go through TSA. Oh wait, I am â€œtoo lateâ€ because I was on the plane for the last four hours and didnâ€™t check in at least an hour in advance and my seat was given away. I had no way of checking in when phone barely receives iMessage on the free WiFi. So I get a â€œseat requestâ€ and am told if Iâ€™m not fast enough that Iâ€™ll have to come back out and buy a new ticket. Strike two. After TSA, I sprint to my gate where I have seconds to spare. Luckily I have a seat left. During that flight is what sealed the deal. They offer flight fuel and meals. I wanted a specific one, I was given something else. Ok, I can deal. When the flight attendants come back to collect trash and recyclables, they never took mine. Keep in mind, this is the same staff that flew from SLC to RDU, now theyâ€™re serving in the return flight. They wouldnâ€™t refill my water. Basically refusing service, and Iâ€™m suffering from nausea (all flights prior were rough), dehydration, and exhaustion. Thatâ€™s not ok. They picked and chose who to serve. I had to leave my garbage in my seat upon landing because they wouldnâ€™t take it. I was happy to get to SLC where Delta staff had better attitudes. The flight from SLC to PDX was better. I slept. I was woken up by the landing. I was happy to be off the plane. My recommendation for Delta is nonexistent. I wouldnâ€™t recommend them to my worst enemy. Who ever was working that flight from SLC to RDU, and returning, you displayed very poor customer service. I wasnâ€™t the only one to notice. They act as if theyâ€™re better than everyone.

Emirates,3.0,Heena Singh,29th February 2016,"Booked to fly from New Delhi to Accra via Dubai in business class with Emirates in Aug 2015 with a layover of 1 hr 20 mins in Dubai. The flight from Delhi took off 30 mins late and then circled Dubai before landing in a remote corner of the airport. We rushed and reached our boarding gate (20 mins before departure) just as the last of the economy passengers were boarding. We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags. Did not expect Emirates to treat business class passengers in this manner. They clearly are now such a big airline that they could not be bothered by these exceptions - imagine how they treat non-gold, economy class travelers - am glad to see other airlines now catching up with them.",A330,Family Leisure,Business Class,DEL to ACC via DXB,August 2015,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,2.0,no

Firstly, you cannot do online check-in as they need to check your passport. After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves.

When we finally found the right gate (since it was switched on us at least twice) the flight had already boarded and the door closed. The attendant at the desk was rude and condenscending when she told us that it was closed and the plane left. We proceeded to wait in the customer service line for two hours in order to talk to a rep who didnâ€™t know anything and had to ask her supervisor on every little question. She tried to figure out why the flight was late but found no reason or explanation why. She said yes the flight was delayed but since there was no reason for it she could not get us a hotel room or even a discount on one. The next flight to South Dakota wasnâ€™t until ten the next morning which would have been too late for the event we needed to get to. We asked if we could be refunded and found a flight back to Tulsa. After a lengthy phone call they decided that they can only get us on the next flight back to Tulsa which was at 2pm the next day and if we want to be refunded we will have to call a number and jump through some more hoops even though itâ€™s the airlines fault for us missing our connecting. We asked if we could possibly fly back on Sunday. Since we were already in Denver we didnâ€™t want to shoot our entire weekend down the drain. She replied with a no due to policy. So here we are in the Denver airport at 10.30 at night with no luggage food or a room. We are missing a baptism. With how we were treated and hurt I am now going to make every effort to never fly United again. I will also never recommend this airline.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa Sioux Falls,February 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no

Air Canada,3.0,W Cooper,28th November 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | My Air Canada flight left Hong Kong at 20.00. A meal was served shortly after take off. It was so bad I left almost all of it. If I'd had any idea that would be the case, I would have brought something on board. Talk about stale, you couldn't even get a fork through the dessert cake. Surely someone should be checking the quality of the food. To add to my disappointment, there was only one opportunity for a beverage. I would have dearly enjoyed a second glass of wine, but it was not an option. Clearly, either a tea totalling crew or that's the new limit. There was not an option of a snack or non-alcoholic beverage. Shortly before landing, we were served breakfast. I can't remember exactly what it was, but again, it was not good and the bun was so stale, I couldn't even tear it open with my fingers. Why even serve bread that must be a month old? Doesn't anyone do a quality check? The entertainment options were poor. Most movies were old. I think there might have been only a couple of current films offered. Seating was fine, but given the upcharge to fly premium economy it was not worth it. I've flown long-haul flights with Air Canada before, sometimes business class, sometimes economy. Sometimes the flights were good, but more often than not, the food is poor and the flight attendants seem to act as they would rather be a home. Last time I will fly an Air Canada long haul flight.

Alitalia,1.0,Anna Spentzou,6th December 2016,"Rome to Cairo. My problem with Alitalia started back in the end of October where I purchased online a ticket from FCO to CAI. Although I paid the amount advertised which was on a special offer, I never received confirmation nor my flight ticket. From there on, my ordeal started and is still ongoing. It has been 2 months already that I cannot get my refund nor a clarification whether I am on the flight I booked or not. After numerous calls to the customer service and waiting time around 15â€™each call, the only answer I am getting is that the airlineâ€™s system is down and the soonest it is fixed they will deal with my issue as I am on a queue of around 3000 passengers. Unbelievable and simply ridiculous! Besides having to spent so much time on the phone and only receiving apologies for the inconvenience and no solution, I had to contact the department via email too, and the only answer I have received is that thereâ€™s nothing they can do for my problem and the only way to solve it is by phone. This is not a workable solution either. I have spent around 300â‚¬ for a flight which I donâ€™t even know if I am on, no information provided, nor explanation or confirmation that I will be refunded. I am beyond frustrated as there seems to not be a solution and for such an enterprise, someone would expect some kind of customer service to say the least. it is a matter of decency, respect and appreciation for the customer to be able to solve such an issue quickly and provide feedback. Apparently Alitalia has no concerns for these principles.

Emirates,2.0,Frank Pollacchi,2nd February 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline. I fly to Australia at least once a year - I'll be looking at alternative airlines from now on.

American Airlines,8.0,S Robinson,31st October 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow in C on a B777-300. Arrived from a domestic flight and transfer in DFW hassle-free, but involved an (easy) change of terminals. DFW is probably one the very best transfer airports in the U.S. AAdmirals Club in DFW was nicer than others I have been to, but offerings very minimal and sub-par for an international flight. Food and ""premium"" drinks for purchase at steep airport prices. Coffee/tea, soft drinks for free. Basic beer and wine available from a manned bar (this is the U.S., so ""free"" means ""for tips""). WIFI was reliable. Overall, definitely not comparable to the lounge experience offered by non U.S.-based airlines. Boarding fairly orderly and cabin crew good and friendly. Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FAâ€™s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated. Catering out of AAâ€™s hub in DFW seems to be superior to that out of other locations. Cabin crew professional, obviously experienced and good, even friendly. On-time departure and on time arrival (more or less). Good experience and nothing to complain about. Comparing to other carriers I have used in C over the Atlantic: as for Oneworld alternatives AA is way ahead of BA (especially due to seating arrangement on AAâ€™s B777-300 vs. BAâ€™s high density 2-4-2 seating), probably in line with AY, but not quite on the level of IB. Also, I would rate the overall experience on Star Allianceâ€™s OS and LX higher, but again AA did good on this flight. Recommended, if you are on B777-300 (seating can be much inferior on other planes types).",Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow,November 2016,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,yes

Two weeks before my flight I received an email from the travel company I had booked with to say that the airline had rescheduled the flight and that I would not be able to make the connection and that I should contact the airline to rearrange.

Still no response from Air New Zealand, with no attempt to compensate me for costs and inconvenience that was all their fault as the rescheduling was due to maintenance issues with their planes.

Aegean Airlines,10.0,Geoffrey Seward,13th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Zurich to Heraklion return. Hats off to Aegean Airlines! My wife and I have been flying to Crete each summer for the last eight years. In the past we have flown with a Swiss charter air line. Which was a pain in the butt, for we had to travel when they did, not when we wanted! This time we went with Aegean Check in at Zurich was just outstanding, AAS did their best to move things along even with a long line, done in less than 20 minutes. This was a late night flight, It left on time, and the in flight service was one of the best that I have experienced in a long time. The only interesting comment I can make about the flight down, was the landing, let's just say it was a copilot landing. The best part of the trip was the return flight. Those of us who have traveled to Heraklion, know that the airport is a pit of pain and agony. I will address this issue, in a separate review,for things have changed. With Aegean they have there own separate check in counter, and a self check in, away from the madding charter craziness. Checkin was completed in 10 minutes! This was just fantastic! Where in the past it took hours! Ther was only a slight delay in takeoff due to weather/air traffic in Zurich, in flight service was outstanding again. After 14 years of long haul air travel for work, I have to give Aegean four stars in respect of outstanding service!",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Heraklion,July 2018,3.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4.0,yes

Southwest Airlines,,Debra Ward,12th February 2015,I flew from Richmond to Fort Myers by way of Atlanta. I was boarded and the problems began. Plane was supposed to leave at 4.25. After 30 minutes of waiting they told the passengers that an outside compartment was stuck open. Had to call maintenance in. Over an hour delay we took off. I asked flight attendant about my transfer in Atlanta she snipped back check at the gate. Got to the gate to find out my connecting plane was already boarding. Went to board and was told my ticket was not good. Got out of line and went to try to resolve this issue. They had changed my flight to the next day. Finally got it straight. Asked about luggage they said no problem it would be on the plane with me. I was the last to board and a day later still no luggage. Very disappointed.,,,Economy Class,,,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,no

United Airlines,7.0,A Clark,18th February 2015,Chicago to St. Louis round-trip. All flights were on time with friendly service. Midday in Chicago I cleared security in 10 minutes. Mobile boarding pass is very helpful. Boarding was quick and easy. Flight operated by Shuttle America E-170. The plane was very comfortable with lots of legroom in standard economy. I am 6' and had no problem. Return was equally as easy. St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights. I arrived an hour be fore both flights but could have got there much later.

Three hours before my Sunday evening return flight from Portland was to depart for San Francisco (3:15 p.m. and my flight was scheduled for 6:20 p.m.), I received three text messages from Alaska Airlines letting me know the flight is canceled and I have been rebooked on a 5 a.m. flight from Portland to San Francisco via Los Angeles arriving in San Francisco at 11:40 a.m. the next day, a Monday. There was no explanation given for the flight cancellation. The text message included a toll-free number that did not work when I called it. It said I had a message waiting for me, but when I pressed ""1"" for my message, it said I had no messages. It was a fully automated line and pressing ""0"" did not connect me to an operator, it only repeated the cycle that said I had a message and then said I did not have a message waiting for me. I had to buy a $199 one-way ticket on Southwest that got me back to San Francisco at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. I had a meeting Monday morning at work that I could not miss and Alaska provided no options for rebooking on other flights that would get me back on Sunday night.

Southwest Airlines flight attendants are friendly, down to earth, professional and the aircraft is comfortable. There was a weather delay however the electronic updates were very user friendly and kept me well informed of my flight status. I like Southwest Airlines because they invest in modern technology not just for the aircraft but you are able to use the internet, also when boarding there are electronic/modern technology used. The attendant announces the boarding class and seat (which sometimes it is hard to hear in the airport or due to the person speaking) but South West electronic devices for the lines alerts with the seat or boarding zone so you can visually read it which is good for people who maybe hearing impaired. Also the flight attendants uniforms are not too professional making the customers feel more at ease. Great job Southwest!

Whilst I understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route, how Emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what I expect when paying a First Class fare.

With all day to spend at the airport they gave me a lousy $7 meal voucher (didn't even pay for one well-needed alcoholic beverage). When I finally got to Tampa at 8pm my luggage did not which I expected since none of the re-routing agents paid any attention to me when I expressed concern about my luggage.

Emirates,1.0,B Shamari,10th March 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai. Knowing her medical condition, I ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. Due to her medical condition, sheâ€™s unable to walk. This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasnâ€™t given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldnâ€™t accommodate her a wheelchair. Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight. At this point Iâ€™m besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk.

Qatar Airways,10.0,Nikolaus Rieskamp,28th June 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | Frankfurt to Dubai via Doha. Qatar Airways really is in a class of its own when flying Business Class. Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal. For me, Qatar Airways is the better way to fly - for not even 2100â‚¬ return.

Horrible airline to fly with - they're on a par with Ryanair in terms of space in the seat, not ideal for flying beyond 2 or 3 hours. I had to lean sideways to the next seat (luckily, my husband's) so I could store my bag under the seat in front. They didn't have enough of both meals to cover everyone so by the time they got to me the only option I had was pasta, which I can't eat. On the whole, the JFK staff were not nice but the American Airlines staff were very rude to everyone, rolling their eyes and moaning to each other loudly about passengers. It was disgraceful behaviour. Our flight was fully boarded on time when we got an announcement saying the essential engine checks had started late so we'd be leaving 'in about half an hour'.

I was stuck there for a whole day, and missed a day at work. No accommodation was offered. The flight from DFW to LHR was depressing. They ran out of meals so was served a sandwich instead.

Aegean Airlines,9.0,N Manos,5th April 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Very reliable and definitely positive experience with all aspects from check in to flight. I flew Berlin Tegel to Athens on an A320. Check in with Aegean Airlines at Berlin Airport was pretty fast. Berlin Tegel is one of the of the most mediocre airports but Aegean check in was fully manned / all seats full with check in staff. Fast check in / very kind personnel. Flight was almost 100% full. Crew were always with a smile and this was a full flight with lots of kids. All in all it felt efficient and hospitable. Food was hot, I ordered for free a Low Fat meal during booking, I think this must be the only airline in Europe still serving hot food + special meals for free in Economy. You can pick any meal during booking through their site. Bread also served, refreshments or wine, coffee, juice etc. Crew were always smiling. Normal economy seat size is very decent. They offer the option of paying to get a ""front seat"" with extra leg room. I have done it in the past and it was worth the 15-20 euros needed. This time I went for a simple seat at the rear of the aircraft, space was decent. I would not complain really, this is a very competitive fare price. If you feel you'll need some more extra space do go for the seat upgrade option for a few extra bucks. Nevertheless for the price / seat combination I was more than happy and ok with my seat size. Flight left on time, maybe 5 minutes late, arrived earlier. All in all a good uneventful flight with good service. No in-flight entertainment but good food / good in-flight crew service without a doubt. Do get some episodes of what you like downloaded onto a cellphone or tablet before hand and problem solved. All in all I would pick Aegean Airlines again based on the efficiency, accuracy of flight time and good fare when you book early / very good crew.

Air Canada,7.0,P Chen,24th August 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I was looking forward to this trip from Los Angeles to Taipei via Vancouver. The flight from Los Angeles to Vancouver was on a newer A330. Each seat had its own personal entertainment system, and meal service included dinner and light snacks. The flight to Taipei did not depart until the next morning so I spent the night at a hotel close to Vancouver Airport (Pacific Gateway which also has a free shuttle between the airport and hotel). The flight from Vancouver to Taipei was on a Boeing 787, seat configuration was 3-3-3. Sat in economy. Unfortunately the room between my seat and the row ahead was very limited. I'm 5 foot 10 inches (about 170 cm) and even without the seat in front of me not reclining, my knees was making contact with the seat back pocket and it contents. Needless to say this made for a very uncomfortable 12 hour flight. The cabin could've used a deep cleaning as I was siting by the window and noticed all the dust bunnies clumped up on the side vents above me. The cabin staff were professional and could not be faulted. On the return flight I paid extra to sit in the bulkhead section (Approximately $60 Canadian). This made all the difference in terms of seat comfort. The cabin staff were also professional. All cabin announcements were made in 3 languages: English, French, and Chinese-Mandarin. At Vancouver Airport, all US bound passengers go through US customs and immigration checks inside Vancouver Airport--so when the flight arrives stateside, I was able to pick up my luggage in domestic arrivals which was a plus. The final leg from Vancouver to Los Angeles was operated by United. Anyone who has flown Eva Air to Taiwan might not be impressed with the Air Canada flight experience, but the price was very competitive when compared to the other airlines that fly between Los Angeles and Taiwan.

Emirates,7.0,McGuinness Kenneth Patrick,6th April 2015,"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.",,,Business Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,9.0,Jayne Southwell,5th August 2015,"Flew World Business Class on outward flight and return from Amsterdam. There was a two hour delay, due to weather so not KLM's fault and the other due to toilets not working correctly which were thankfully fixed before departure. We were kept informed of the former delay via e-mail and a telephone call and as the plane boarded with a personal apology which was a nice approach. Service outbound was fantastic. Excellent food and choice of wines particulary the Dutch white, also the ruby port. The new flatbed seats I found spacious and speedily adjustable. The flight back was OK but lacked the personal and efficient element of outbound which is why I didn't give full marks. Staff friendly but I gained the impression staff just wanted passengers fed and watered as quickly as possible and many things were forgotten, from cognac to museli, everything was a rush. To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small. Didn't happen on European hopper flights however we flew economy as didn't see the point of an upgrade on a 45 min flight. Efficient, organised service from boarding to arrival. We had no problems with any of the reservation part and seat allocation.

Emirates,1.0,Joern Sauer,10th July 2015,"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubaiâ€“Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks â€“ wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter â€“ they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Sydney via Dubai,July 2015,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

First, the charging plugs on my entire row was not working. All the flight attendants said was ""oh I'm sorry, I'll write it up."" I had to press the issue until I was given an alternative to getting my devices charged. The next thing was discovered when we landed in Houston, was that we was not going to make our connection to Memphis. So we was directed to customer service. We were given a later flight, but they failed to inform us that that flight was delayed as well. We found it out while on our way to our gate, by text message. They knew that that flight was delayed long before we got our flight rebooked. They allow flights to be booked too close together so there is no way the connection can be made. And they fail to inform people about delays until the last second. Then all they can say is ""I'm sorry"" So empty, so sad. Now if we do not comply with their rules and schedules, they can decline our flight, without refund. Now how is that fair?

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,8.0,Jesperi Lauhio,13th March 2014,"Jakarta - Kuala Lumpur - Amsterdam - Helsinki in economy class. In general a very enjoyable experience. Only thing to complain about is the economy seat on the B777-300ER planes. Jakarta - Kuala Lumpur was a short hop of 1.5 hrs. Everything ran smoothly: check in at Jakarta was hassle free. Onboard a warm meal was served not the best but really good for airplane food. The salad and cake were far too cold. The cabin crew were very welcoming friendly and smiling. Overall the service was very good. I had booked myself a preferred seat (30â‚¬) from KLM website in advance. Stop over in Kuala Lumpur was very smooth. Clear announcements made onboard in Dutch and English. Arrival announcements were also made in Indonesian and Malaysian although these were not that comprehensive. Kuala Lumpur - Amsterdam was a 12 hour leg. The cabin crew were excellent. A hot meal and breakfast was served on the flight. After the meal I slept for 7 hours even though the seat was uncomfortable. Economy seats onboard the 777-300ER plane just ruins the day. The seat pitch is 32"" and seat width 17.5"". The seat is a little too hard in my opinion and the recline is just ridiculous. Even the 737 I flew to Helsinki had a superior economy seat compared to the long haul plane. Transfer in Amsterdam was very simple and easy no problems whatsoever. Nice and friendly staff on ground as well even though a little colder service. Amsterdam - Helsinki was a very pleasant flight. Packed flight. The cabin crew were once again very warm and smiling. The food served was two pieces of sandwich which I liked. Seat onboard this B737-800 aircraft was really comfortable and reclined more than onboard the 777.

Air New Zealand,2.0,J Johnson,3rd March 2014,Flew round trip from LAX to Rarotonga. The flight into Raro was fine except for the simply fair quality of food. The seating in economy was comfortable for a 9 hour overnight international flight. My primary complaint is about the terribly long lines for check-in at Raro for the Saturday night departure to LAX. The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure. There's obviously poor management for a process that occurs once per week and seemingly could easily be remedied by having a couple of more persons on staff for this check-in installation of some kiosks a faster computer system and some fans outside of the counter area. If you're infirm elderly or don't want your vacation capped off by a very unpleasant experience on your departure consider some other destination (or perhaps Virgin Australia).,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,no

Because the plane departed late from Cancun we made it through the long lines and customs with 15 minutes left to make our gate. That is until they called me back and said they won't take my luggage. I asked why and was told there was not enough time. We told them we could easily make it to the gate and they refused to let us go. Instead we were sent to the ticket counter to. Rebook our flight. That is when we were told the flights were booked and we might not leave till the next day. They were not willing to work with us at all and it just infuriated us more. We asked to speak to the manager and he also came off as arrogant and took no responsibility for our situation. We ended up having words with him that got us nowhere.

Air New Zealand,2.0,A Boone,31st July 2014,"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

The negative experiences that I have I often just take with a smile. Not so this time. American Airlines provoked me so much on my last flights with them. I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffÃ¨t of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude. It is simply incredible how unwelcome AA crews can make you feel on their long-haul flights.

However, our luggage was lost on a recent trip to Lemnos. It seems Aegean ground staff at Lemnos Airport were limited to the transparency of the situation.

The Aegean staff were extremely accommodating to my questions and follow ups - in actual fact, I did sympathise with them and the position they were in as there were others in a similar situation.

The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and for some this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the ""rules"" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF.

Qatar Airways,8.0,B Mandeno,6th November 2016,"âœ… Verified Review | I flew New York to Doha return on an A350 in Business Class in late October. The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard.

Emirates,5.0,H Calavo,23rd April 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in DÃ¼sseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.",A380 / Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Dusseldorf to Shanghai via Dubai,April 2017,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,yes
Qatar Airways,4.0,P Mercer,11th May 2014,LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. On the first flight there was a family consisting of husband wife and children all in business but with a number of maids and a baby in economy. During the flight the maids were constantly coming into the business section and squeezing between the seats and using the toilets. When I asked the cabin manager whether it was Qatar Airwaysâ€™ policy to allow economy passengers to walk around the business cabin he said it was not but this particular passenger was listed on the manifest as a â€˜VVIPâ€™ which meant they could do nothing about it. At one level it was an excellent experience â€“ the quality of the food in both the lounges (LHR and DOH) and on the aircraft was remarkable and the cabin crew were consistently friendly responsive and effective. The Boeing 777 seats were comfortable and the IFE varied and stimulating. All of the aircraft were clean and although one of them was getting old there were no signs of wear. Qatar Airways wants to sell itself as the â€˜Worldâ€™s 5-star airlineâ€™ but it must ensure that it behaves like one and not allow its VIPs to let their staff enjoy the business cabin without actually paying for it.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Michael Southern,11th November 2015,"American Airlines was not a pleasant experience. It was my first and more than likely will be my last time using them. I was suppose to fly from Milwaukee to Dallas to Austin. Due to fog, we had to land in San Antonio. I can understand weather delays and the fact that it is out of the employees control. I did not appreciate however having to sit on the tarmac in San Antonio, TX for 2 plus hours. Furthermore, we were not offered any potential deal, whereas I needed to get to Austin which was closer to San Antonio. Only the people with the final destination as San Antonio were able to deplane. I could have taken a rental car to get to Austin, as it was closer to San Antonio. Instead, we had to wait 2 plus hours, fly back to Dallas and deal with it. After getting back to Dallas finally, they had only 2 concierce working a 75 plus person line. What was even more irritating was someone came down the line handing out a customer service number and basically said, this is what you will need to do. I called, was put on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on. I called again, at which time they were able to get me on a 4:59 pm flight out of Dallas to Austin. Shocker, that flight was delayed until 6:59 p.m. and once on the runway was delayed another 20 minutes. Not once did someone say, sorry about your delay, not once was I offered an airport meal/beverage.

They switched my flight to Alitalia and this is where my nightmare began. I flew from Heathrow and transferred in Rome to Cairo Egypt. Before I boarded my flight I went to the desk to make sure my suitcase had been transferred to the flight. The gate attendant looked on the computer and said yes your bag is on board. I then boarded the flight transferred in London and made it too my final destination Cairo. The flight from Rome to Cairo was very rocky and I couldn't wait too get off that plane. I then proceeded to baggage claim to pick up my suitcase. Every bag came out and mine was no where to be found. I started to panic because I was meeting friends in Cairo and we were on a 14 day trip to Egypt, Israel and Jordon. I went to look for baggage office and there was know one there except a lady giving out paper missing luggage reports. No computers nothing. I pleaded with her that this was an emergency and I needed to get my suitcase back immediately because I was on a 14 day international trip. She assured me my bag would be on the next flight and they would immediately send my bag to my hotel in Cairo. I felt relieved went to my hotel two days passed no bags no nothing. I tried calling the number on missing luggage report that she gave me know one answered. Tour guides,manager of hotel everyone tried calling to get my luggage back. Finally I realized they gave me a number that wasn't being answered at all. I had another flight and went back to Cairo to file a police report. I reported my luggage stolen because the airline gave me false contact info. I had to borrow clothes from my friends I was traveling with. Buy clothes from street markets when I could. I was stressed out but still hoping they would return my luggage well long story short. Alitalia airlines kept my luggage the whole 14 days I was traveling. My bag was finally returned to me when I got back to USA. It was twenty five days later. I had put a card on my luggage with my contact info it had my name home phone number, address and email address. They never contacted me at all instead they let my luggage sit in a luggage room the whole time with my info on it. What did I get from this airline. They said we're sorry you were inconvinced. To date I have received nothing no compensation for severely disrupting my dream vacation. This is the worst airline on the planet. I wouldn't trust them with anything. Don't give them your bags.

Qatar Airways,7.0,Zafrullah Hamzah,12th November 2014,First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.,,,Business Class,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,yes

On checking in told the reserved and multiple times confirmed seats requested were not assigned to me. Agent has no idea why and cannot recover them. No greeting on boarding C cabin is full. Immediately after take-off the flight attendant (term used politely) closes the forward curtain and sits down. After an hour of no service - and no one even walking into the cabin - I begin ringing the call button to ask for a coffee (flight departs 06.15 hrs). Rung at least 8 times finally a coach attendant comes forward to ask why I am ringing the button so much. When I ask for a simple cup of coffee the forward attendant says everyone is asleep why did I have to awaken them? When told I had been ringing for service she shrugs and says she never heard the bell. Throws half a cup at me and says she has to now prepare for landing. Many of our complaints on here are petty but hopefully some airline execs read these comments. In this case a lazy and rude flight attendant coupled with a begrudgingly served half cup of tepid coffee has cost AZ the potential for my returning and for AZ to get some pretty decent revenue.,,,Business Class,,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,5.0,no

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,2.0,D Cassius,1st April 2015,Rio to AMS in EcoComfort. KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM.

There was a long queue at the priority check-in counter and the (rude) check in staff refused to give business-class passengers priority through using the other (economy) check-in counters.",A320,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Toronto,December 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,yes
Turkish Airlines,1.0,Karen Helweg-Larsen,6th July 2015,"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines â€“ starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips â€“ first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasnâ€™t a big surprise â€“ despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time â€“ on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul â€“ one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation â€“ and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members â€“ first to a supervisor in the check in area â€“ who said â€œnoâ€ and that was that. At the care Point â€“ the staff couldnâ€™t care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, thereâ€™s an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise â€“ Europeâ€™s Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service â€“ caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Los Angeles,July 2015,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,no

We didn't have any problems coming to New York but today we arrived at La Guardia airport very early and we went to the main line to try to get an early flight back home. The woman was extremely rude. My husband asked for an early flight and she pretended not to hear him and started doing our check-in for the regular flight. He asked her again if she was doing a check-in for the earliest flight and she answered him rudely with a ironic smile saying that we had to pay more for that flight. Even before she told us the price for the flight change, she finished checking us in when, my husband asked her how much was the fare if we wanted to get the earlier flight and again she gave us the ironic face telling us the price while handing us the tickets.

American Airlines,1.0,Michael Agamaite,4th February 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Chicago via Milwaukee. Our airline was late due to a flight attendant being late to board the plane, the flight was delayed a total of 3 times putting us approx. 45 minutes behind. We did make up some significant time on our duration and got off the plane with about 20 minutes to spare, we ran across the airport to our gate where we learned that they gave our seats away due to us. It being there, the funny thing was they also informed us that they oversold our flight and gave our seats to those people. The best the guy at the counter could offer us was a flight almost 4 hours later or a $20 bus ticket- unbelievable, one of the most unaccomadating experiences I have been related to.

American Airlines,1.0,S Kordan,3rd May 2019,"âœ… Trip Verified | San Diego to Detroit. Worst flight I have ever been on. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. My original flight was supposed to take me to Chicago, then to Toledo. Those flights got delayed, and there were no other flights to Toledo for the night. They suggested that I take the flight to Chicago and be stranded there for the night, making it very clear they would not pay for a hotel nor meals. I had them switch my flights around so I would go to Phoenix and then Detroit, which would get me an hour further from home but at least I wouldn't need to find somewhere to stay. Again, flights kept getting delayed. I was concerned I would miss my connecting flight from Phoenix to Detroit so I asked the lady working at the gate counter about it and she spoke to me for condescending. She wasn't good at hiding her facial expressions. She talked to me like I was a child and was wasting her time. There was nobody behind me waiting to be helped, so it is not like she was even busy. She clearly does not need to be working in customer service. After I got to Phoenix, they boarded us on time to leave for Detroit, then had us sitting on the plane delayed for almost two hours with very few updates. Finally we figured out that something needed fixed on one of the planes wings, and it took this long to get someone there to fix it. Why board us all on a plane that may not even be operational in the first place, not sure. On top of all that, they gave us an old plane that we were unable to charge any of our devices on, AND I had a seat that did not move at all. So I got to be uncomfortable the entire flight with no form of entertainment. At one point I got up to get my sweatpants out of my bag because it was very cold, and the flight attendant just glared at me as if I was doing something wrong. I will never be booking with AA again. What was supposed to be a 6 hour trip turned into almost 20. Very poor customer service. I would give it a 0 star rating if I could.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Detroit,April 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no

Our flight attendant immediately welcomed us and gave special attention to our heavily sedated dogs. Tina listened to our story and made us feel like the only passengers aboard the full aircraft. I witnessed her executing her duties throughout the flight in a professional, timely and warm manner, and being a lifetime service industry professional, myself, I noted how she engaged her passengers with genuine courtesy.

Whilst our cabin staff worked hard the flight deck were indifferent with not even the courtesy of a visit to see how bad the conditions were. We understand others like us complained to Air NZ but we did not get a reply for almost 6 weeks.

Unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

Air Canada,7.0,Leanne Bree,13th July 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Booking with Air Canada, via Brisbane then Vancouver to Toronto. Initially they had me on a morning flight from Melbourne but I felt the time between flights was too tight, together with fog/winter issues so I called and arranged a flight the day before, it cost me an extra $300. The shock came at the airport when I found they downgraded me to economy, not a big issue except the $300 extra is more than a normal one way flight. Anyway determined to put this behind me, I used the kiosks at Brisbane airport to check in and self label my bags. The lounge (NZ) was really nice. Boarding was in zones with children going first, then zone 1-5 in order. The plane was a Boeing 787 with pods. Offered fruit juice or water and nuts to start, then handed menus. The FAs were nice but apart from meals, they were mostly absent, the meals were small but tasty. Then snacks (chips, water, chocolate and fruit) were left to help ourselves to. On the menu was a list of hot snacks on request. Meals were trolley service, like upmarket economy. Entertainment was ok, not extensive but adequate. The seat was a little hard but ok. Breakfast was nice although the FA gave me a lecture on sugar when I asked for milk and sugar in my coffee. After arrival in Vancouver and the necessary immigration procedure followed, it was off to domestic and the lounge. Stayed there just a few minutes, it was crowded, inadequate, little to offer, so I just walked around until the Toronto flight. Old plane, again boarded via zones. The food on board was dire. The nice FA offered me alternatives, I just opted for a cookie. The entertainment in board was better than the Dreamliner.

Which is the biggest garbage can of a airport that I've been to we got here and trash was laying everywhere. Next our flight from Miami to Tallahassee was scheduled for 10:30 but got canceled. So we're waiting again.

We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth.

Emirates,4.0,N Massar,6th March 2016,"Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons. However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew.

Turkish Airlines,2.0,Paola Blanton,6th August 2015,"Turkish Airlines night flight from Heathrow through Ataturk on my way to Bulgaria. Arriving in Ataturk around 4 AM, I waited for the gate indication for the 7:30 flight to Bulgaria. Around 5:30am, it opened, so I went to the gate and showed the pair of Turkish Airlines employees my boarding pass and sat down right in the front row of the departure lounge. Exhaustion took over and I slumped in my chair, jerking awake to see the bus leaving for the plane and the big red letters CLOSED. I jumped to the desk and asked the man why he did not call me or wake me up, when he knew I was on that flight. He simply smirked and said â€œNot my responsibilityâ€. I asked him what I should do, but he was determined to brush me off, simply saying â€œtry going upstairs to the transfer desk.â€ Well, that set off a chain of absurdity the likes of which Iâ€™ve never seen in my life. It seemed that every employee, either of Ataturk Airport or of Turkish Airlines, ranged from nonchalant to downright belligerent. I was sent on a wild goose chase from desk to desk to desk, with practically everyone having the â€œnot my responsibilityâ€ attitude. There was no solution at the â€œtransfer deskâ€, and they kept sending me to other desks in what began to feel like some kind of absurd hazing ritual. Finally, after running the gauntlet several times, I was informed that I would have to clear immigration to get to the Turkish Airlines sales desk in the airport. Supposedly that was the only path to a solution for my problem. I stood in line for over an hour to get stamped, but was told â€œYou need a Turkish visa.â€ Incredulous, on my way to the visa desk, I asked the same information clerk why he didnâ€™t tell me that I needed a visa, and he (I am not making this up) told me â€œYou didnâ€™t ask. Itâ€™s not my responsibility to think for you.â€ At this point, I was choking back tears. I just couldnâ€™t believe it. I got back into line after paying 20 pounds for a visa and about an hour later finally got to the Turkish Airlines sales desk. The clerk informed me that it was â€œnot Turkish Airlinesâ€™ problemâ€ that I was not notified of the boarding and that I would have to pay an additional 265 euros in order to be able to board the next available flight, which was twelve hours later. I thought that was extremely unfair, given that I was at the gate on time and had identified myself to the ground staff. I thought I had the right to be informed of the flight leaving and woken up. Nothing I said to them was received with any amount of comprehension, compassion, or understanding. They said that if I didnâ€™t like their solution, I could go to their â€œsupervisorâ€™s deskâ€ at counter B15. At counter B15, I waited and waited until I finally got to talk to the extremely annoyed agent, who curtly informed me that she was â€œnot authorizedâ€ to handle my request, and that I was welcome to call customer service at the help phone. The lady on the help phone was the most helpful out of anyone I had spoken to in a now 5-hour drama, but even she was only able to â€œmake a reportâ€. Long story short, I was forced to pay 178 euros to board the next flight, and when I got to Sofia that night, I saw that Turkish Airlines lost my luggage on top of everything. Three days later, I was informed that Turkish Airlines will not deliver my lost luggage, so I am forced to pay another 100 euros in taxis to get to the airport in Sofia to retrieve my things.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sofia via Istanbul,July 2015,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,no

American Airlines,1.0,Walker Roy,20th June 2014,I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes.

The downside was that I felt like being served without a personal touch why? 1) No second pre departure drink. 2) I was asked what I like to eat without receiving the menu first and the FA forgot to ask which appetizer I want (normally that is fixed). 3) During the flight it was hard to get snacks and drinks (I had to walk to the economy class FA's and ask them). 4) In preparation for landing I had to bring my hand luggage back in the overhead bins on my own (FA asked me to get up and do it while she was standing next to me without helping me). The good stuff was the taste of the food and the good wines/drinks as well as a comfortable lie flat seat with an angle (only a few of the 25 KLM 777 are lie flat without an angle today). Speaking about the FA's on board they where always smiling and the economy FA's have been very helpful fast and with a personal touch.

After flying with British Airways for years now I decided to try Air Canada, but I won't again. The service and food were bad and a lot of screens and/or earphone plugs aren't working. As an single traveller, 6""4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her.

I like the fact that they acknowledge veterans on the flights thatâ€™s hard to come by these days. I booked the flights directly through Southwest using their app on my phone. We flew out of Cleveland to Atlanta then to San Antonio. The return flight was from San Antonio to Baltimore then to Cleveland.,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to San Antonio,January 2018,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,yes

Unfortunately or maybe fortunately or it could have been planned that way, the flight to Seattle, was also delayed over one hour.

United Airlines,8.0,Roger Stone,13th March 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | After all the poor reviews I had some trepidation flying United within the United States. However all was pretty fine. My flight from San Francisco to Denver was delayed as the aircraft comes in from Auckland before proceeding to Denver. Once on-board the service was very good indeed and very personal and pleasant. First Class fares in the US are not much more (if at all) than many economy fares in Australia so I suspect economy/coach passengers in the US on United have little to complain about - there is no such thing as a free lunch! The United Club before boarding was fine except the food offerings were not so good. Picking up a boarding pass coming in from an international flight was not so good either - very slack staff, However, once on board, I really enjoyed being able to chat to the flight crew on boarding and afterwards as well as the good wine. The United DBA express onwards to Lincoln was fine, even in economy. I would happily fly United again..",Boeing 777 / CRJ200,Business,First Class,San Francisco to Lincoln via Denver,March 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,5.0,yes

Aeromexico,7.0,Davide Greco,15th February 2010,MEX-LIM. Nice and fast check-in procedures inside the beautiful Aeromexico lounge at new Terminal 2. Flight operated by a freshly re-painted B737-800 - first time I experience an almost 6 hour flight on this kind of plane but the interior was clean and confortable so this was not a big issue. The only problem was that we were at row 12 just before the emergency exit so our seats would not recline for safety reasons: I would have appreciated to be informed about that before the assignment! Meal was served very early (6pm) considering mexican habits but I did not eat so I cannot judge. Crew polite even if not very friendly. We arrived at Lima half an hour ahead of schedule. Overall a positive experience but the price could have been more competitive (we paid EUR 1.000 for two economy tickets).,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1.0,yes

Air New Zealand,,Brown Nyree,18th September 2014,Code share Virgin Australia. Flight number VA7405. AKL airport and several Air NZ staff were unable to tell me where to check in despite it being an Air NZ flight. Screen confirmed check in at Gate A where I had been asking. Told to check in at kiosk but would only accept Air NZ flight number and my e-ticket only had VA flight number. Told by successive staff I must have been given Air NZ flight number unwilling to help. Shoved e-ticket under the nose of the staff member who insisted I should know and said showed me where it states Air NZ flight number. He said it was NZ105. He could have said that 10 mins earlier. By the time I checked in the flight was boarding and I still had to get to the departure gate through customs and to the boarding gate. Just made the plane and was told by Air NZ staff I should have checked in and moved to gate earlier. 1 hr 15 min to check in. Unacceptable. Onboard having travelled 5 hours to the airport and the check in debacle I looked forward to a meal and movie. Told no meal no movie. Uncomfortable seat that barely reclined. I fly Emirates and am used to a meal tea coffee wine and the ICE entertainment system. One FA gave me movie access out of pity and I had to pay $10 for a sandwich. Emirates please fly to Denpasar Bali so I never have to go through this again. Our national carrier is a disorganised disgrace.,,,Economy Class,,,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,no
Qatar Airways,10.0,Graeme Barber,6th September 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | Edinburgh to Muscat via Doha. I used to fly British Airways 3 or 4 times a year between Muscat and Edinburgh but considering the visible decline in both aircraft quality and service now being offered by BA I decided to try Qatar Airways. The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice. I will be booking this years Christmas escape with Qatar Airways. Truly a 5 star airline.",350 & 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Edinburgh to Muscat via Doha,August 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,yes

Air New Zealand,10.0,R Connett,8th July 2014,I flew AKL-LAX on 24 June NZ2 returning LAX-AKL on 1 July on NZ5. I was in Business Class both ways. The service and attention to detail is exemplary. Even in the middle of the night pushing the call button got immediate attention. The food both ways was exceptional and it was always nice to be asked if I would like some more or is their anything else I can get you. In these days of cost cutting in service and staff on tight contracts Air NZ staff really do go that extra mile and really do look like they enjoy their jobs. The flights arrived early both ends which is always welcomed the pilots very rarely get the recognition they deserve in these surveys.,,,Business Class,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes
Air Canada,2.0,T Reynolds,21st July 2017,"âœ… Verified Review | I recently flew Air Canada business class from NYC LGA to Toronto YYZ. Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a ""snack"" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in ""so quickly"" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would ""catch up"" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared. If she hadn't walked into that room, I would've sat there waiting for my name to pop up on some screen and wasted more time! I was considering Air Canada for future Asian and / or European trips but after experiencing this, I am not flying them ever again.

Emirates,10.0,L Jarvis,18th December 2014,LHR-DBX-SIN A380. Emirates A380 is a brilliant product. I flew economy - and it was arguably the best cabin experience. Spacious great inflight entertainment comfortable seat amazingly lit cabin at night and great food. It was really difficult to fault. The staff were friendly and helpful got some great sleep on the flight too - and there's really not much else to say! Would highly recommend.,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes
Lufthansa,1.0,Joseph Carnarius,19th August 2018,"âœ… Trip Verified | Berlin to Bangkok via Munich. I was booked onto Lufthansa as as I wanted a relaxed and relatively comfortable flight. First flight was ok. Got a beer a snack and was on time. Switched into the Bangkok flight in Munich and realised this was a Eurowings codeshare. If you want inflight entertainment you pay 9.90 EUR, a blanket 6 EUR, headphones 3 EUR. Apparently I had been booked in the SMART tariffs, so I got 1 alcohol drink and a spartan meal. Had to pay for my beer. When I asked how I get such service with Lufthansa, I was told I could see it was an Eurowings flight by looking at the flight Number. I understand Eurowings is a budget airline, however Lufthansa is not.",,Business,Economy Class,Berlin to Bangkok via Munich,August 2018,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no
